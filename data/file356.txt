3560030 re response to indy man not sure where to start to answer indy mans question but typically hospitals and vendors alike are using middleware that provides vendor agnostic connectivity from bedside monitors vents and pumps into the hospital emr the emr manages most of what clinicians will see once the data is sent across middleware includes data management tools but clinicians generally want to maintain the workflow in the emr so each brand of emr will offer different bells and whistles there are a number of device manufacturer offerings for connectivity like ge philips etc but as you can imagine they prefer you to use their solutions so will push the hospital to standardize many hospitals will find it better to choose vendor agnostic middleware when using a variety of devices and device manufacturers a leader in device connectivity is capsule technologies my company partnered with capsule to be able to provide the connectivity solution to meditech customers and in our due diligence could not find any other product that could integrate over 350 different device types and provide the level of features that they do

3560032 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
3560033 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
3560034 i think about my family and friends and worry they are in danger
3560035 at this moment it would be better for me to be with my family and friends in this situation to support them i am happy people at home will have a chance to live in peace but i dont think this is the end the conflict zones still exist and something must be done
3560036 this is a dangerous situation in georgia but i feel optimistic about the agreement and that it will be sustained
3560037 hopefully the russians will pull out after that theyll probably negotiate for 10 years
3560038 this is a real tragedy for the people of georgia and their new democracy
3560039 russia has responded to georgian efforts to assert its sovereignty in south ossetia with wildly disproportionate force at the cost of many lives and the stability of the region i stay in close touch with many friends and former students in georgia and they are all very fearful of the widening scope of the war
3560040 the u s isnt in a position to make russia stop
3560041 i think it will be a stalemate without any shooting

3560047 this retreat was very relaxing and peaceful i will definitely come back

3560079 but winter is really a breeze when you think about those less fortunate than yourself
3560080 we somalians compare winter to other scenarios we could be stuck in

3560082 america has places like new orleans with real struggles and i respect those struggles
3560083 that song is me talking to rappers who glorify their hood like its the end of the world somalians are happy if we even get to live in their hood their hood is our salvation
3560084 even though i didnt understand the language just the fact that i was listening to foreign music gave me a place to dream
3560085 the rare rapper who doesnt exploit or more accurately glorify his difficult past his music and words mean a lot to me as an african because it has truth and dignity and its extremely funky
3560086 i used the b 3 hammond organ that bob marley actually used on exodus
3560087 id say i sketched out my first ideas of what i wanted to do musically when i lived there
3560088 i was in the scenario that most somalian people are living in there which is just kind of struggling it out
3560089 in minneapolis when you see the somalian community its clear the lack of representation in the media that was the thing i most thought about when i was there i saw something was missing so id come home and write which started me down this path
3560090 i couldve just been the good entertainer and everybody would have been happy but i had to say something how many kids who came from where i did the streets of mogadishu would ever get that kind of chance
3560091 i could say nothing about the somalian experience and still live pretty well make my money
3560092 but i have a true passion for my country and my people and for justice thats what keeps me from being quiet

3560097 a deal has been reached between president mugabe and mdc mutambara faction which has been signed in the presence of president mbeki
3560098 negotiators are meeting right now trying to find the technical details of how the new government will be structured

3560121 i dont know that were in a position to totally eliminate it
3560122 by all accounts the barriers in place were very appropriate on that bridge given the traffic population it serves
3560123 that would depend on whatever factors were present prior to her falling asleep whether there were indications that she knew she was tired
3560124 but most importantly we dont know thats what happened thats what she said but all of that will be determined in the investigation

3560129 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated

3560131 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3560135 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3560136 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3560137 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3560138 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3560139 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3560140 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3560141 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3560142 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3560144 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3560145 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3560154 thank goodness you knew better and what if we had needed that money to live
3560155 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3560156 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3560157 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3560158 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3560159 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3560160 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3560161 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3560162 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3560163 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3560164 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3560165 im not granting any authority to any passenger carriers until i get my hands around this
3560166 historically the greatest improvements in the quality of life have come from two long patterns the extension of the rule of law and the development and diffusion of technology first there has been a gradual extension of the rule of law which protects the weak from the predatory and ensures private property rights which encourages the accumulation of wealth and the expenditure of effort
3560167 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3560168 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3560169 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3560170 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3560171 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3560172 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3560173 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3560174 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3560175 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3560176 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3560177 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3560178 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
3560179 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3560180 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3560181 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3560182 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3560183 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3560184 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3560185 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3560186 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3560187 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3560188 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3560189 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3560190 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3560191 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3560192 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3560193 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3560194 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3560195 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3560196 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3560197 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3560198 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3560199 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3560200 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3560203 me siguieron golpeando me pusieron boca abajo con otras personas pasaban los polic as y nos pisaban nos pateaban les ped agua y me dec an no perro te vas a morir lleg aristeo l pez
3560204 yo les dec a a los polic as no hice nada ya no me peguen tengo hijos mejor ll venme a la c rcel y ellos se burlaban y me segu an golpeando me ped an que dijera que ulises
3560205 despu s me sacaron y me llevaron a una letrina llena de suciedad donde me metieron la cara hasta casi ahogarme luego me subieron a la caja de una camioneta con doble cabina ah estaban tirados boca abajo puros profesores entre ellos olivo mart nez vicente cruz y eliel gonz lez
3560206 nos llevaron a un cerro nos bajaron de la camioneta y nos arrastraron me torturaron sicol gicamente me apuntaban con una pistola a la cabeza y me dec an te vas a morir cabr n y le jalaban pero no tronaba se re an mucho
3560207 se ensa aron conmigo me trataron como dec an ellos como un perro prendieron el soplete que tra a para mi trabajo me alzaron la playera y me quemaron el est mago me bajaron los pantalones y me quemaron los test culos tambi n me quemaron la espalda con cigarros por andar de revoltoso con los appos

3560212 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3560213 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3560214 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3560215 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3560216 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3560217 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3560218 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3560219 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3560220 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3560221 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3560222 it set me to remembering a number of unfortunate incidents of canoodling with certain boys i never really found canoodle worthy or even remotely appetizing but for some reason allowed myself to fall to canoodling with anyway
3560223 gwen petersen and jeane rhodes have once again co authored a book of verse tall in the sidesaddle that tells how it is out west in cowgirl land
3560224 the symbols of western heros and heroines are cowboys and cowgirls for western women cowgirls it was the qualities of honesty courage loyalty and grit that saw our foremothers through rugged rough times built a heap of character and honed funny bones
3560225 to read tall in the sidesaddle is to chuckle laugh out loud and occasionally swallow a lump in the throat
3560226 of all the nine days customs going meatless is the hardest for me i pine for it and pretend im pining for korbanos
3560227 it still hurts the ozone layer just not as much
3560228 we are the poorest and the sickest and yet cutting costs seems to be a major factor when decisions are made about our health care
3560229 its the culture that exists that aboriginal people just get substandard care in everything and especially in health care
3560230 you dont need to be emotive about whats happening here
3560231 all you have to do is explain the facts they show the real extent of the disaster endured by aboriginal people
3560232 in my first year here my favourite word to describe the situation facing aboriginal people was abhorrent
3560233 someone will say we should have an alcohol and drug rehabilitation service which is great and one is established but then not provided with any real resources or funding and therefore cant function properly this sort of thing goes on all the time and across the board
3560234 for example the intervention doctors identified about 80 to 100 kids who were supposed to have heart disease
3560235 the intervention has estimated that 20 to 25 percent of aboriginal children have ear problems but this figure is wrong its much higher than that this means it has duplicated what we already knew but then doesnt get it right and yet spends all this money to do so
3560236 i was recently talking to a doctor friend in one of the remote communities and he was really upset because he is not being told what is happening with the intervention or able to participate his expert knowledge in the field is simply being ignored if this was properly planned you could put in some amazing health infrastructure but instead it all feels like a political show
3560237 but the money being promised for this is completely inadequate
3560238 the only way to make a real change is if you consult with the people working on the ground
3560239 labor is great on the symbolism it comes out and says its sorry to the stolen generation but continues to expand the intervention which is a racist piece of legislation
3560240 i agree with you that this makes it very simple to roll out welfare quarantining onto non aboriginal sectors of society
3560241 the other point i want to make about the intervention is that theres never been any framework to discuss it objectively the government and media polarise the either for the intervention and therefore good or against it and therefore supporting pedophilia
3560242 all this is part of the governments non consultative almost colonialist approach where health workers and people on the ground are just not asked what they want or what should be done there have been all sorts of delegations to minister for indigenous affairs macklin but she only acknowledges those who are for the intervention if youre against youre just ignored
3560243 good writers honest insightful but also courageous in some way
3560244 a liberal calvinista whose heart is strangely warmed and whose affinity for a much maligned biblical figure is sort of an obsession
3560245 here i blog i can do no other god help me
3560246 we ll be delivering bottles of polluted athabasca river water to ceos and politicians
3560247 i really believe in living your beliefs and this is a really interesting opportunity to do that
3560248 even in some of the northern communities where a lot of the population is depending on the oil industry we found that a lot of people were inviting us into their homes and wanted to talk about what we wanted to talk about
3560249 i m from edmonton but i ve never seen the tarsands
3560250 for me that will be very important in itself to sort of understand the wider context
3560251 ideally no one would have to go on these kinds of urgent protests
3560252 me estoy sintiendo bien en el plato estoy haciendo buenos contactos elevando la bola
3560253 a estas alturas bueno ya estoy agarrando el ritmo que ten a antes de dar jonrones de vez en cuando espero estar as el resto de la temporada
3560254 quiero llegar a la meta de 100 remolques y empujar m s de 100 yo trato de hacer mi trabajo y hacerlo por a os consecutivos
3560255 estar en los r cords y empezar ahora a ocupar el primer lugar es algo importante especialmente en tu pa s
3560256 poco a poco hemos hecho eventos compartiendo con los ni os latinos y me ha ido muy bien ha sido muy rec proco todo
3560257 de verdad que la he pasado muy bien aqu y espero continuar haciendo todas estas obras
3560258 estoy contento de estar aqu y formar parte de este gran equipo
3560259 me gustar a tener un contrato y quedarme aqu por varios a os
3560260 estoy bien f sicamente saludable pero hay que esperar a ver lo que va a suceder
3560261 no hemos empezado conversaciones ni nada al respecto me imagino que eso ser despu s de que termine todo esto ahorita hay que enfocarse en clasificar y ganar partidos para entrar a la clasificaci n
3560262 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months

3560313 i would be concerned if we had no ipos and we had a big falloff on the companies entering the pipeline grabow said
3560314 many factors from high market volatility the slowdown in the world economy sustained high oil prices and overall uncertainty all combined to weaken the ipo pipeline for the second quarter
3560315 market performance needs to stabilize for at least a quarter before we hope to see stronger ipo pipeline activity
3560316 once the markets have stabilized we think there are a lot of companies out there that would like to enter that pipeline and start that process
3560317 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left

3560349 in 2005 junk mail surpassed what we call first class mail as the majority of what the usps us postal service was delivering
3560350 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry

3560390 students are inside a classroom tethered to a place using textbooks and handouts printed materials they must pay tuition and register to attend the experience is closed talking during class or working with others outside of class is generally discouraged each student is isolated though surrounded by peers each student receives exactly the same instruction as each of her classmates the information presented is generic and students are students and do not participate in the teaching process they are consumers
3560391 from her dorm room the student center a coffee shop the bus a student connects to the internet using her laptop she is mobile uses google to find a relevant web page a digital resource which is open for her to access while carrying out her search she chats with one friend on the phone and another using instant messaging to see if they can assist in her search she is connected to other people she follows links from one website to another exploring related information the content is connected to other content she quickly finds exactly the information she needs ignoring irrelevant material she gets what is important to her personally and she shares her find with her friends by phone and im she participates in the teaching process
3560392 once upon a time the university library was the primary repository of research like peer reviewed journals and monographs today initiatives like the public library of science and pre print services like arxiv org provide individuals from around the world with a legitimate alternative source of research findings
3560393 once upon a time a college or universitys faculty was the primary repository of technical and academic expertise in a community today technologies like email and instant messaging put seekers of expertise in touch with faculty at many universities as well as professionals pro am hobbyists and others from around the world almost instantly
3560394 once upon a time the degree programs of our colleges and universities were the credentials most highly valued by employers today certifications like the microsoft certified systems engineer cisco certified internetwork expert and the red hat certified architect certificates are sometimes worth more to an employer than a four year degree in computer science
3560395 the university experience must align more closely with its societal context and participant base higher education must continue its efforts to become digital and mobile while working to become significantly more open connected personal and participatory
3560396 i believe that openness is the gateway to connectedness personalization and participation openness is a catalyst for further innovation
3560397 as a faculty member if i want to connect my course materials to prerequisite materials from classes students have already taken in order to create review opportunities or provide remediation this connectivity is possible only if both i and the students have access to these materials
3560398 as a faculty member if i want to personalize the experience for my students or more importantly if i want to empower my students to meaningfully personalize the experience themselves we have to be permitted to edit and customize the materials we will use
3560399 as a faculty member if i want to engage my students in creating and contributing resources tutorials and other study materials to a class this is much more easily done when the course material repository is open without this openness there is no space for the students to make contributions and the degree of participation in the experience our students expect is not attainable

3560418 the bottom line is charter school law was not followed and oversight was not provided
3560419 he did not defraud swindle or steal from that school
3560420 minneapolis played no part in this until now when theyre going to take it away
3560421 this is not an easy decision it ticks me off that one person was able to affect 250 students

3560427 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3560428 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3560429 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3560430 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3560431 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3560440 there is no question that the bush administration will want to express its disapproval and to downgrade the relationship
3560441 but at the same time the united states doesnt want to shoot itself in the foot
3560442 if the russians continue to be bloody minded i think we are in for a very bad time
3560443 we are not going to have another cold war but we are going to have a very tense relationship
3560444 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3560445 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3560504 suspended for 10 days rather than terminated for grabbing an employee and ripping his shirt this was an incident of workplace violence that many people felt he deserved more
3560505 i do want to address the many recent comments in the paper of this being the wrong time to make a move or change in hta leadership because of the support the industry has received from the current director please know that this view is not the majority of the industry but there is a reluctance to speak out due to the legislative support that he has gotten
3560506 the industry will survive fine there is a good team on the ground and i believe we can find the appropriate leadership needed

3560536 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3560537 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3560538 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3560539 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3560540 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3560541 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3560542 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3560543 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3560544 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3560545 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3560546 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3560547 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3560548 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3560549 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3560550 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3560551 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3560552 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3560553 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3560557 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3560558 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3560559 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3560560 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3560561 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3560562 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3560563 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3560569 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3560570 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3560571 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3560574 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3560575 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3560576 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3560579 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3560580 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3560581 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban

3560616 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3560617 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3560618 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding

3560620 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute

3560623 edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3560624 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
3560625 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3560626 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3560627 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
3560628 ooh do you mean the olympics are just so you guys can ogle wom
3560629 edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk

3560634 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3560635 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3560636 he was probably eight feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3560637 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3560638 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3560639 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3560640 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3560641 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3560642 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3560643 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3560644 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think

3560647 we are communicating about communicating too much people seem to be at a stand still and are just continually repeating ourselves over and over again i first felt that i was learning a lot now i am not so sure its not very fun to listen about listening or communicating about communicating i think we should start discussing real issues then analyze how we went about the communication flow and what we could have done better i feel that the discussions are almost becoming too abstract and without substance
3560648 you can say what you feel and what you want to achieve but that is not the same as communicating it
3560649 if you can trace some kind of turn taking or exchange among several people over a period of time that illustrates the theme that is the ultimate goal

3560764 former congressman jim leach a respected republican from iowa threw his support behind barack obama today
3560765 barack obama vacationing in hawaii put out a statement repeating his call for russia to stop its attacks
3560766 wrote quote i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3560772 but nothing that has caused him any serious political trouble with voters
3560773 obama put out a tongue in cheek response to senator mccains celebrity ad
3560774 the ad also features six different shots of senator mccain next to president bush
3560775 just may be the most powerful woman in chicago besides oprah
3560776 question obamas authenticity as an american she rejected that strategy
3560777 there are indications that john mccain may be adopting it now
3560778 some say that john mccain has tried to subtly portray obama as not quite american enough playing up obamas popularity abroad

3560780 john mccain the american president americans have been waiting for
3560781 a line many saw as implying something not american about obama

3560784 the building is far too valuable to the community to simply knock down and replace with a smaller generic office building cities known for their quality of life embrace a preservation ethic that benefits the entire community rather than a tear down mentality toledo has made great progress in renovating the re using distinctive buildings that enhance community identity and pride and i am convinced that the demolition of the united way building will halt this progress and be a step backwards for the city and for the united way
3560785 as a point of information the united way building is located within the downtown overlay zoning district and demolition of the building would be subject to review by the toledo city plan commission with comments solicited from the city historic district commission the city plan commission has the authority to impose a waiting period of up to six months from the date of the hearing of the application again i respectfully urge you to reconsider your decision to demolish this unique and distinctive building and to explore all other options the city and i will assist the united way in every way possible except the demolition process
3560786 extend an invitation for continued dialogue between all interested parties for an equitable and just solution that benefits both the united way of greater toledo and the city of toledo

3560814 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3560815 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3560816 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3560817 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3560818 we are not staying home with our children by default
3560819 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3560820 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3560821 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
3560822 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3560823 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3560824 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3560825 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3560826 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3560827 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3560828 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3560829 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3560830 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3560831 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3560832 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3560833 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3560834 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3560835 i dont know anybody that didnt like him he was just liked by everyone and he had a gentle soul

3560839 all these different factors are leading to their decline and its really really serious weve been finding dead frogs by the hundreds and thousands
3560840 if you ran into a problem where you really were concerned about something and wanted to do detailed scientific analysis these rules would make it much harder to do that
3560841 the endangered species act has evolved into something that is less concerned with helping species and more concerned with exerting economic control and holding up or sometimes stopping important economic activity

3560847 there is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth from the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree and does not rest until it has found one then singing among the savage branches it impales itself upon the longest sharpest spine and dying it rises above its own agony to outcarol the lark and the nightingale one superlative song existence the price but the whole world stills to listen and god in his heaven smiles for the best is only bought at the cost of great pain or so says the legend the bird with the thorn in its breast it follows an immutable law it is driven by it knows not what to impale itself and die singing at the very instant the thorn enters there is no awareness in it of the dying to come it simply sings and sings until there is not the life left to utter another note but we when we put the thorns in our breasts we know we understand and still we do it still we do it

3560852 wireless broadband continues to bolster mobile growth across the industry and optuss result is no exception with almost 70 per cent of optus post paid subscriber growth driven by this new product segment
3560853 all up a solid result the move away from wholesaling telstra services has also helped margins in the consumer division and compensated for a significant bad debt in the mobile division
3560854 we registered our interest when they tried to sell the business late last year
3560855 we did the same earlier this year and we continue to follow it but weve not yet had an engagement with them i continue to this day to be dismayed

3560867 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3560868 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote
3560869 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens

3560899 even in some of the northern communities where a lot of the population is depending on the oil industry we found that a lot of people were inviting us into their homes and wanted to talk about what we wanted to talk about
3560900 for me that will be very important in itself to sort of understand the wider context

3560920 hey well honestly i dont know i love it but i think its more because of the scent than anything else i havent really seen it clean my bathtub like crazy or anything but then i bet i probably dont use it as often i forget at times as i should luster steve says he hasnt cleaned his tub in 4 years since using the spray so its working for him i think its best if you start with a really great clean shower tub and go from there that way youre maintaining and not trying to get the tub clean by using the daily shower i wish i could find an honest to goodness natural way to get rid of mildew and mold in the bathroom any ideas people

3560954 its hard to see how russia will pull out of south ossetia and abkhazia now georgia now will have a big hole in it
3560955 probably believed rather naively he might get more support from the united states
3560956 you could probably say georgia triggered it but russia was clearly ready to respond
3560957 the straw that broke the camels back was saakashvili and georgia moving into south ossetia

3560964 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3560965 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit

3561025 sebagai orang islam kita perlu bersikap adil memberi penjelasan kepada mereka isu timbul apabila penjelasan itu timbul daripada pihak yang tidak layak seperti sisters in islam
3561026 jadi bagaimana mereka akan dapat penjelasan yang sebenarnya tentang islam
3561027 pihak bertanggung jawab seperti jakim dan jabatan perdana menteri perlu menguraikan kekusutan tentang pentakrifan dalam istilah perlembagaan kepada bukan islam
3561028 umat islam akan melihat isu tersebut berkenaan akan melibatkan hak umat islam untuk memastikan undang undang islam tidak dicabar
3561029 jadi dengan kerangka undang undang yang telah termaktub dalam perkara 121 1a dalam perlembagaan persekutuan itu berkaitan bidangkuasa mahkamah syariah kenapa pihak pihak yang berkenaan perlu mengadakan perbahasan terbuka yang mempersoal bidangkuasa ini
3561030 jika tidak perbahasan terbuka itu dilihat bertujuan untuk mengkritik undang undang islam dan memaksakan udang undang sivil mendominasi undang undang islam apakah pihak penganjur forum itu boleh berfikir mereka mempunyai tujuan lain dan ia boleh dipercayai oleh umat islam

3561041 he just punched me so hard in the stomach that i knew something wasnt right
3561042 after he struck me i was in fear for my life they were standing me up and taking turns
3561043 i really think this will be a precursor of a larger american role
3561044 putting nicholson in there is recognition that weve got to get more us engagement in the headquarters
3561045 they are laying the necessary groundwork so that the really painful but necessary decisions will fall to the next administration including the us taking over in a significant way
3561046 i think it would be better if we had allies stepping in to do it
3561047 but if they are not going to do it in the end us control is a good thing because it will help improve the security situation
3561048 they are actively involved in determining whether or not additional forces can be sent to afghanistan perhaps as soon as this year
3561049 we wont compromise safety for anything thats how important it is to us
3561050 people have the sense that well sitting in a parking lot i dont think its safe

3561061 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3561062 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3561063 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3561064 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3561065 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3561066 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3561076 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice email personal information manager and browsing
3561077 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3561078 must employ previously released methods such as imap internet message access protocol in the concierge support level or await third party products that can tie into the security policy features delivered with the firmware 2 0 upgrade
3561079 organisationally were heading towards migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3561080 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3561081 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3561082 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3561083 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use

3561099 masyarakat sulsel ternyata melek politik banyaknya massa golkar di daerah ini satu bukti bahwa masyarakat sulsel tidak buta politik tahun 1997 ini diharapkan dari keseluruhan wajib pilih di sulsel 90 34 persen diantaranya adalah warga golkar

3561101 saya tahu ada segelintir orang orang yang golput tolong dicatat bahwa orang seperti itu adalah orang yang tidak bertanggung jawab sebab tidak memikirkan masa depannya dan masa depan bangsanya mereka adalah orang orang yang buta politik dan tidak mau menggunakan haknya walaupun golput itu tidak ada sanksinya namun falsafah pancasila tidak golput karena itu saya berharap warga golkar mau mengajak orang lain untuk ikut memilih
3561102 we have always been trying to handle the issue of papua within the frame of democracy including upholding the law in an independent way free from foreign influence
3561103 the government never interferes in the law enforcing agency that has issued a binding verdict to the two people so please look at this matter as a form of independent law enforcement within the frame of a democratic state
3561104 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3561105 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3561106 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3561107 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one

3561123 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3561124 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3561125 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3561136 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3561137 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3561138 we zero in on everything in these last few days really
3561139 were trying to find out who can step up and help us
3561140 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not

3561144 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3561173 the boys and our fans should be proud of what we accomplished this season
3561174 its disappointing to fall short of a state tournament berth but we proved that we werent going to lose easily
3561175 we werent expected to make it this far in the playoffs
3561176 i guess you could say we peaked at the right time but all the credit goes to the boys they worked hard and kept playing hard until the last out
3561177 all four finals teams were very evenly matched throughout the night with the final scores between the first and fourth place finishers separated by a mere 3 5 points in the end the national poetry slam title was claimed for a second consecutive year by slamcharlotte which won with a total of 113 7 points the new york squad came in with a very close second score of 113 2 followed by austin at 110 5 and boston at 110 2 the audience seemed happy with the results as they were announced and readied for a final party to close out the five night blowout of spoken word
3561178 obviously they are not playing in the premier league like we are but they can still play football and on a bad day for us if we are not concentrating then we can lose to a side like fh hafnarfjardar
3561179 so we must be careful and take this game seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be

3561250 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3561251 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3561252 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3561253 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3561254 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3561255 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3561256 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar

3561259 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3561260 what happened to taddy sounds very nasty but were hoping that its not that bad

3561264 kai hit film dene ke baad aap aajkal kewal doordarshan ke liye hi serials kyun banate hain bahut se private channels hain aur films bhi and meant productions houses
3561265 main umra ke 80ve saal me chal raha hoon aur filmo n me kaam karte hue 60 saal se jyada ho gaye ab aise me kisi private channel ki 22 23 saal ki mba ladaki mere paas aakar mujhe camera kaise pakadna chahiye ki angle se shot lena chahiye ye samajhane lage to ab mera seekhna mushkil hai doordarshan mujhe apne hisaab se kaam karne ki swatantrata deta hai doordarshan me trp ke liye story badalne ka chalan bhi nahin hai islie mujhe doordarshan ke saath kaam karne me mazaa aata hai
3561266 after giving so many hit films why are you directing only serials for doordarshan
3561267 i am running in my 80th year and have given more than 60 years to films and if today a 22 23 year old mba girls from a private channel tells me how to hold the camera and teaches how should i take the shot its a time to think i really want to do that

3561276 in 1996 osama bin laden photo declared war on the united states under his leadership planners have carried out bloody terrorist attacks on us and other citizens around the world
3561277 in 2001 terrorists sent by bin laden killed nearly 3 000 people in the united states since then leaders have continued to exhort their followers to violence

3561279 there are some things the torture of prisoners for example which are illegal and morally unacceptable under all circumstances i dont think the same absolute prohibition applies to targeting commanders

3561282 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3561283 it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3561284 we must take the initiative to further develop higher yielding and climate resilient varieties of crop
3561285 its been going on for a few days with him and i told him if it doesnt get any better with nomar coming back this was probably one of the options we have and he was ok with it

3561290 i called the next day and told them i didnt want it
3561291 my client was surprised to learn of the claim she had been mistreated by tac
3561292 although it is true that representatives of tac called at her home and solicited her business her contention that she was somehow subjected to high pressure sales tactics or victimized by a fast talking salesman is untrue
3561293 the owner of the memphis bbb franchise has repeatedly and unfairly attacked tac
3561294 years ago mr hutchinson memphis bbb owner was rebuffed by tom brady husband of susan brady who is the owner and sole member of the alarm company llc when mr hutchinson approached mr brady regarding the prospect of having a company with which mr brady was associated become a member of the better business bureau mid south
3561295 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3561296 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3561297 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3561298 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3561299 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3561300 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3561301 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3561302 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3561303 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3561304 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3561305 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3561306 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3561307 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him

3561341 no im chad brock lets pass this thing for a while

3561344 the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
3561345 oh hell that irritating mogambo idiot imi is off on a real tirade lets go get something to eat and drink and we wont give him any hahaha
3561346 in rome 277 bc the denarius was born it was a silver coin and for the first 250 years its silver content declined only modestly the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
3561347 in 54 ad emperor nero started to inflate and debase the value of romes money nero took 14 3 of the silver out of the denarius coin and 11 of the gold out of the aureus coin replacing the precious metals with base metals
3561348 as rome continued on its moral political and monetary decline by 193 ad the denarius had only 26 grains of silver a 61 devaluation from the original 66 grains shortly thereafter romes denarius stopped being accepted in trade by the rest of the world by 268 the denarius was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating
3561349 if we flash forward to the u s in the 1960s we find that in one fell swoop all of the silver was taken out of our coins and replaced with base metals are we rome on steroids
3561350 merritts plan looks great on paper and essentially costs nothing for microsoft to try
3561351 for 25 million per year or about the cost of of 1 1800th of a yahoo microsoft could push a few hundred smart kids through this program
3561352 it would be good for microsoft if they were able to engage startups more one way to do it would be by investing in them i dont think they could or should do it in the same format as y combinator though its too messy this early if they were going to invest in startups they should do it in the next stage
3561353 at ycs stage investing is a lot more involved than just supplying money and a big company wouldnt be good at the kind of things you have to do plus the failure rate is very high
3561354 the culture of a y combinator would be virtually impossible to replicate by any big company and even if it were theoretically feasible the people like graham who would be needed to run such an incubator would either never sign up to do so or if they did they wouldnt last long

3561358 the tiny former soviet republic of azerbaijan is on the verge of an oil boom this summer a 1 000 mile pipeline is expected to begin pumping oil from azerbaijans caspian sea coast through neighboring georgia to a turkish port on the mediterranean sea industry experts say this pipeline will allow azerbaijan to eventually quadruple its oil exports but political opponents in azerbaijan worry that the oil money will help the government of the former soviet republic stifle pro democracy efforts the 4 billion project is backed by the united states in part because it gets caspian sea oil wealth out to the international market without going through azerbaijans much larger neighbors russia and iran

3561363 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3561364 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3561365 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3561366 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3561367 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3561368 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3561369 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3561370 however the other parts of amgs results were strong with underlying profit of all divisions in line with or better than we had expected
3561371 ja solar probably has one of the least risky 2009s versus its chinese peers

3561374 in 2005 junk mail surpassed what we call first class mail as the majority of what the usps us postal service was delivering
3561375 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry
3561376 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3561377 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3561378 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3561379 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena

3561399 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
3561400 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
3561401 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
3561402 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
3561403 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
3561404 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
3561405 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
3561406 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable

3561425 great things are not done by impulse but by a series
3561426 not long ago shopping in china consisted mostly of lining up to entreat surly clerks to accept cash in exchange for ugly merchandise that did not fit but now
3561427 this girl must have been a total hardworking girl who aced her exams so much so that her mom made it even before the results
3561428 the environment were concerned for that as a landfill because we want to keep hazardous waste materials out of the landfill and avoid any affects to the environment
3561429 considering im a teenager it could affect me in the future with where everything is at
3561430 if you feel uncomfortable putting it down the drain or flushing it down the toilet then most likely its a problem
3561431 the brumby government is taking action now to work with landholders on what has the potential to be a serious plague
3561432 the combined risk of hatchings in victoria and adult locusts travelling south from new south wales or queensland means victorians need to be aware of the threat
3561433 the full extent of egg laying is unclear at this point however it is vital that we prepare for all possible situations
3561434 the brumby government will work closely with the australian plague locust commission aplc and the new south wales department of primary industries to ensure an efficient response to locusts is implemented
3561435 we are committed to keeping the community informed and we will actively liaise with regional councils and keep them informed with regular briefings
3561436 to combat the threat of a locust outbreak a dpi locust planning team has been formed to plan ahead and monitor any possible outbreaks
3561437 experts will be on hand to provide landholders with advice on how to deal with the threat of locusts including how and when to spray and which chemicals are available to control this pest
3561438 all victorians are encouraged to be vigilant in reporting any sightings of locusts to the dpi so we can monitor locust populations and movement and the department can provide advice on how to control them
3561439 locusts are easiest to control during their early stages as hoppers when they are unable to fly once they become adults control measures become much more difficult and expensive
3561440 landholders will be able to control them at the early stage by using one of the several chemicals registered for use in the specific control of locusts

3561458 if russia is allowed to follow through on a doctrine of issuing passports to residents of an adjacent country aiding the secessionists in their provocation of that country intervening on their behalf destroying the military infrastructure of that country annexing those territories and achieving regime change in the subject country and getting away with it well those are some terrible precedents for all who live on its borders to deal with russia today headline

3561463 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3561464 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3561465 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3561466 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3561467 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3561468 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate

3561475 there is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth from the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree and does not rest until it has found one then singing among the savage branches it impales itself upon the longest sharpest spine and dying it rises above its own agony to outcarol the lark and the nightingale one superlative song existence the price but the whole world stills to listen and god in his heaven smiles for the best is only bought at the cost of great pain or so says the legend the bird with the thorn in its breast it follows an immutable law it is driven by it knows not what to impale itself and die singing at the very instant the thorn enters there is no awareness in it of the dying to come it simply sings and sings until there is not the life left to utter another note but we when we put the thorns in our breasts we know we understand and still we do it still we do it
3561476 i do not have any pain or soreness in my knee
3561477 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3561478 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3561479 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3561480 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3561481 other than the fact that you dont have 92 telling you exactly what is coming and what to expect there really isnt much difference this year
3561482 it isnt like its a new position for me im a starter now thats it
3561483 im just going to build on what we established last year and continue getting better
3561484 maybe i am baiting some offensive coordinators not to double team me right now
3561485 honestly i am the new guy on the block but i feel i am going to go out there and give whoever tries to block me a long night
3561486 we have everything in already that we are going to throw at people
3561487 its a lot of the same things but we have more twists to them it will be a little more complex but we are ready for that now we can make a lot of the calls he is making
3561488 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3561489 it was maybe a little more frustrating this time having played him last week and winning fairly easily
3561490 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3561491 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3561492 i felt ok i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3561493 he felt better and decided to do a few things
3561494 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3561495 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3561496 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3561497 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3561498 the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia called on the united nations to condemn
3561499 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3561500 one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion on the path to becoming a member
3561501 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3561502 one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3561503 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3561504 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
3561505 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3561506 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3561507 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
3561508 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam
3561509 i pulled myself up to my windowsill and peered into the stars imagining they were the one thousand and one eyes of al lah when he looked at me what did he see inferiority a shrunken soul a light that shone more feebly than that of a man or did he see what i felt a bright burning like the bush hed inhabited the day hed revealed himself to moses
3561510 this was the beginning of something new something terrible soon i would be lying on my bed beneath him squashed like a scarab beetle flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me he would not want to hurt me but how could he help it its always painful the first time
3561511 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
3561512 muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal i assume he did all the things a man does he had 12 wives im sure he had sex with them
3561513 im glad the story has come out because now any publisher who takes it on will do so with eyes wide open im hoping to find someone who is as passionate as i am and my agent is
3561514 they behaved as any publisher in the west should do and upheld freedom of publication and freedom of speech they stuck by their guns at not inconsiderable risk to their senior executives these are the principles we should live and die by
3561515 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3561516 the oic hopes that all segments of society in germany and other parts of europe will come out strongly against the holding of such a conference and reject the proponents of hatred and racism

3561518 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shia villages but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3561519 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace
3561520 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3561521 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3561522 fourteen people died in the agitation of 1953 and the slogan was one constitution one flag and one head
3561523 it also said that if all points are met with jammu will still feel discontent since their is a political disparity
3561524 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3561525 there are elements within the us administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and the isi

3561527 hes very smart very organized he just was always headed in this direction
3561528 every day he was looking to hurt someone it was the only satisfaction he got in life

3561537 those column things that i swore were being powered by a hydraulic machine or some other advanced mechanized device turned out to be fueled by people unreal
3561538 i can understand the replacement and i dont really care whether there was lipsynching or not but to do it 15 minutes before the show was cruel

3561546 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3561547 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible
3561548 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3561549 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3561550 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3561551 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3561564 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3561565 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3561566 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3561567 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3561568 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3561569 old times vitaly churkin told cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting
3561570 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3561571 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3561572 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3561591 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3561592 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3561593 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3561594 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3561595 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3561596 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3561597 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3561598 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3561599 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3561600 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3561601 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3561602 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3561603 al m de meu time ser ruim ainda vem esses rbitros v o tudo tomar no c
3561604 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3561605 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3561613 to prevent the weaker numbers of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest commissioned to keep them down but as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock then any of the minor harpies it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws
3561614 whatever can be proved to be good must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof the medical art is proved to be good by its conducing to health but how is it possible to prove that health is good the art of music is good for the reason among others that it produces pleasure but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good if then it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula including all things which are in themselves good and that what ever else is good is not so as an end but as a mean the formula may be accepted or rejected but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof

3561616 sie sozialisten vergessen dass berall wo es keine konkurrenz gibt ein monopol besteht und dass ein monopol in allen formen eine steuer auf die erwerbst tigkeit zugunsten der unt tigkeit oder gar der raubgier ist sie vergessen ferner dass mit ausnahme der konkurrenz unter den arbeitern insofern dienlich ist als sie ihre verbrauchsgegenst nde verbilligt dass konkurrenz selbst auf dem arbeitsmarkt nicht die ursache eines niedrigen sondern eines hohen arbeitslohnes berall dort ist wo der wettbewerb in der nachfrage nach arbeit den wettbewerb im angebot der arbeit bersteigt wie in amerika in den kolonien und in gewerben mit gelernten arbeitskr ften sie vergessen ferner dass sie niemals einen grund niedrigen lohnes abgeben kann es sei denn durch berf llung des arbeitsmarktes infolge einer zu gro en zahl von arbeiterfamilien umgekehrt kann wenn das angebot an arbeitskr ften zu stark ist auch der sozialismus eine niedrige entlohnung nicht verhindern im brigen wird wenn das genossenschaftswesen sich allgemeiner ausbreitet kein wettbewerb unter arbeitern bestehen und die konkurrenz zwischen den genossenschaften w rde zugunsten der verbraucher d h zugunsten der genossenschaften und der erwerbst tigen klassen berhaupt wirken
3561617 der schutz gegen konkurrenz ist ein schutz der faulheit und der geistigen tr gheit
3561618 die arbeitenden klassen werden noch weniger als heute gewillt sein sich nur von dem ansehen und dem u eren schein der vornehmeren klassen auf den von ihnen einzuschlagenden wegen leiten und f hren zu lassen wenn sie schon jetzt keine ehrerbietige scheu und religi sen gehorsam besitzen die sie in geistiger h rigkeit gegen ber einer ber ihnen stehenden klasse festhalten k nnten so werden sie sie in zukunft weniger haben die schutz und abh ngigkeitstheorie wird ihnen mehr und mehr unertr glich sein und sie werden fordern dass ihr verhalten und ihre lebensbedingungen im wesentlichen von ihnen selbst bestimmt werden es ist gleichzeitig wohl m glich dass sie in manchen f llen die einmischung der gesetzgebung in ihre angelegenheiten und die gesetzliche regelung verschiedener sie betreffender verh ltnisse fordern wobei sie dann oft ihr selbstinteresse falsch verstehen werden

3561628 the politicians and the business leaders are finally starting to realize that all this violence theyre having right across the river in reynosa and matamoros in tamaulipas is caused by the drug trade

3561667 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3561668 theres certainly been resurgence in people asking how to do my job games writing and story design is still very niche there arent many folks doing it and even less that understand it i dont do this to become known i do it because i love my job and have a somewhat masochistic desire to help make games stories better
3561669 the 2d story telling is a primary vehicle for communicating some of the more complex scenes but not all of them
3561670 its here that the real problem with the whole casual hardcore dichotomy really lies casual gamers are not invaders or interlopers encroaching on hallowed gaming soil with their shallow interests and gimmicky controllers and silly party games casual gamers and you may want to sit down for this bit were here first
3561671 tetris wouldnt be released today in the casual games space unless it had a story mode about you working your way across the world looking for clues about your missing uncle one tetris round at a time sadly i think casual games have started to feel some of that bloat of traditional games adding features and fluff to the point of obscuring the core gameplay
3561672 secondary gamer whos kind of becoming an extreme young heavy gamer without knowing it
3561673 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
3561674 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side
3561675 we suspect that this is revenge tehrik e taliban and al qaida theyre all under attack we suspect this blast has been done by tehrik e taliban to take revenge for our activities
3561676 we are hitting their hideouts so naturally they are responding
3561677 imports will be a little less of a drag on economic growth than appeared earlier but weaker imports still reflect the overall weakness in the u s economy
3561678 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl
3561679 we at talecris have long admired csl the opportunity for our employees customers distributors suppliers and most importantly our patients to benefit from being part of the csl family is exciting and is a testament to the quality and strength of talecris relationships with its stakeholders at the same time the transaction represents a good return for our shareholders many of whom are our employees
3561680 we believe talecris has demonstrated a track record of the utmost integrity and ethics and has some of the most widely used life enhancing plasma derived therapies available
3561681 patients count on talecris to provide them with the therapies they need we are committed to growing and enhancing the business to the benefit of all stakeholders
3561682 the results are very poor but weve been expecting this to happen
3561683 my biggest worry is falling private consumption rising prices have been clearly affecting consumption gdp will remain in a downward trend as long as consumption stays weak
3561684 we cant expect export growth to accelerate any time soon so the economy will remain in an adjustment phase for the rest of this year
3561685 everyone out there has to understand that if youre allowing expenses to increase by four percent youre not going to devastate anything
3561686 i do not know how theyll be maintained i believe class size will increase and not meet standards for graduation
3561687 lets take a look at expenses first mandate relief and look to see if any tax cap is necessary
3561688 were hoping they maintain our funding roughly 65 percent of our funding comes from the state
3561689 we might not be able to do as much certainly well pay attention to the quality and well take care of basic needs well do the best we can
3561690 if everyones giving its a fair plan if theyre not you have to ask why cost is being shifted to other taxpayers
3561691 recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent my instinctive reaction to this realization has been to soldier on but i have too much respect for myself my family the school the students the faculty and the staff to continue
3561692 the already difficult and challenging job of being the high school principal becomes next to impossible
3561693 its a loss for the community i think joe was an excellent principal my only concern is that people will remember only this most recent episode
3561694 was foggy in his memory of how he heard about the information
3561695 the widest possible audience in the world for the games
3561696 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3561697 it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3561698 we must take the initiative to further develop higher yielding and climate resilient varieties of crop
3561699 plamen pediu voluntariamente um novo exame e por isso voltou para a bulg ria se o novo teste der negativo ele poder voltar equipe

3561701 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3561702 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3561703 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3561704 if this scenario had happened nine months ago he wouldnt have been captured or he would have asked for help and they would have let him go
3561705 thats a clear indication of the change of attitude taking place among tijuana police
3561706 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont
3561707 as soon as you step in youre covered head to toe with fleas
3561708 shes as starved for affection as she is food she still has diarrhea
3561709 they said they didnt know why their animals were dying they were very angry we were taking the animals away from them and they didnt offer any information they simply said were taking care of them but theyre dying theres nothing we can do the response they gave was very strange
3561710 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont
3561711 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3561712 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3561713 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
3561714 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3561715 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3561718 steph you are just too damn honest to be a decent thief you need to pursue another line of work

3561726 well she cant live here mom has offered again to set stephanie up in an apartment and pay most of her rent mom is so worried that steph will piss you off she loves you with me i think its a great idea

3561728 do you really think she looks good she was so beautiful when she was 15 long blond hair thin legs she coulda been a contenda
3561729 yes stephanie is becoming pretty sarah there is no way that i can be the cause for you and your mom to reward steph for bad behavior i will feel horrible on the other hand i agree if she cannot get and hold a job she doesnt deserve to live here

3561745 well steph brought it on herself i got a call from my mother about an hour ago steph and her two of her girl friends went over to they were all chatting and laughing when steph excused herself to go to the bathroom she stole at least 100 out of moms purse mom figured it out just before they left she knows how broke steph is and she was offering to give them twenty dollars for some ice cream when they quickly excused themselves and left ive got to call the cell phone company next
3561746 hold on you will need to talk to steph everyday she is still your daughter and you love her perhaps you should let her keep the cell phone
3561747 stephanie will drive me up the wall by calling every two

3561749 shes out spending my moms money that should take about another hour im miserable will you be able to handle it tommy
3561750 think about what you are going to say when she calls how about something like i love you when you get a job you can move back and use the mustang

3561765 growth in u s real output over the next few quarters looks slower now than it did just three months ago
3561766 a weaker near term outlook for the labor market accompanies the outlook for slower output growth

3561773 theyre back and theyre willing to stand up for their interests and the west doesnt have a lot of options
3561774 if you give the russians a chance they will take advantage of it they will play their own game and by their own rules
3561775 its hard to see how russia will pull out of south ossetia and abkhazia now georgia now will have a big hole in it
3561776 probably believed rather naively he might get more support from the united states
3561777 you could probably say georgia triggered it but russia was clearly ready to respond
3561778 the straw that broke the camels back was saakashvili and georgia moving into south ossetia
3561779 the west does not have a whole lot of leverage over russia right now
3561780 very much shows that russia calls the shots in the region
3561781 theres going to be a serious debate in the west now about how we deal with russia
3561782 recibimos la noticia del triunfo con mucha satisfacci n y alegr a porque creemos necesario que se den pasos profundos en la participaci n de los ind genas

3561792 mr anderson welcome back like what ive done with the place
3561793 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
3561794 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation
3561795 again requirement that a actual discussion takes place is only on your head you only must provide an idea for other to express objection and grant them a chance to do it

3561798 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3561799 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3561800 sending this along as the perfect example of ladbss complete incompetence while it may look ok in these photos above upon personal inspection close is not necessary this house was put together with spit and a prayer

3561806 steve is an experienced and visionary leader whose proven record of success leading online services makes him an ideal person to join our board
3561807 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
3561808 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
3561809 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
3561810 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
3561811 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
3561812 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
3561813 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
3561814 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
3561815 what weve done is built away of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern
3561816 quiero aclarar que en ning n momento ni el gobierno nacional ni evo personalmente se han comprometido a construir un nuevo estadio en el departamento de la paz
3561817 el presidente morales me dijo que le permiti ramos jugar ahora en su capital pero que construir a un estadio nuevo
3561818 quiero pedir al presidente de la fifa que corrija sus declaraciones pero fundamentalmente que se sume a defender esta universalidad del deporte los vetos que intentaron hacer con bolivia no coinciden con las mismos estatutos que tiene fifa
3561819 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team

3561821 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen were going to win it next year

3561823 thrice obama voted to let doctors and nurses allow these tiny human beings die of neglect and be tossed out with the medical waste how can a man who purports to be a christian justify this if as its advocates contend abortion has to remain legal to protect the life and health mental and physical of the mother how is a mothers life or health in the least threatened by a baby no longer inside her but lying on a table or in a pan fighting for life and breath

3561830 and i think just a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it
3561831 im totally against it because of the heavy flaws in it but i will abide by it because it was a democratic vote
3561832 either he votes against it or he supports it if he votes against it should he be a member of a council that is signed up to that policy
3561833 if you have been a member or ex member of the bnp or a known supporter or activist in anyway it is against the law to join the metropolitan police to me thats discrimination but the equal opportunities act doesnt cover that sort of discrimination everybody is complaining about me but nobody is shouting from the roof tops that bnp members are discriminated against in everyday life
3561834 everyone in this country should have the right to say what they want the problem is we are having that right taken away from us

3561837 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3561838 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3561839 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3561840 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues

3561866 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3561867 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3561868 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3561869 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
3561870 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3561871 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3561872 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3561873 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3561874 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3561875 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3561876 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3561881 they try to support us they understand us they come and say that you know we are really sorry and we are your friends and we are we are
3561882 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3561883 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes
3561884 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive

3562096 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3562097 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3562098 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3562099 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3562107 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
3562108 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others
3562109 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus
3562110 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves

3562117 was behind the jail bars and in the providence of god there came a time when two men dreamed a dream the butler and the baker who were waiting for either execution or pardon and god gave this young man the interpretation of these two dreams
3562118 and god opened the prison doors and that young jew stood before pharaoh and god gave him the interpretation and then joseph went a little further and said

3562121 youve got an empty cradle bend over it with your tears
3562122 youve got a drinking husband as a little wife came last week hold on for god can save him i read the other day in the life of caesar augustus that when he died the roman senate passed a decree that caesar augustus should be worshiped as god but at the same time that caesar augustus lived a child was born and that child died and rose from the grave therefore ill look and see the place where he lay wrought in him when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand far above all principalities power and might and dominion and hath given him a name above every name that is named in this world and of that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and has given him to be head over all things to his church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all

3562128 i support the troops but really only when its politically convenient
3562129 una actividad inferencial m s que compartimos con algunos animales de nuestra escala evolutiva
3562130 aquella actividad que tiene un objetivo preciso pero que no suele usar procedimientosrutinarios
3562131 lo que vale para el todo vale para cada una de sus partes
3562132 in my new role i will be serving the wider community and not just horsham
3562133 my responsibility will also be the campuses in stawell and ararat
3562134 my role will be dealing with staff and being that link between the community industry and the university
3562135 im excited about networking across the community on a bigger scale and just getting involved in community activities and the important issues
3562136 id like to look at the needs of the community such as training and play the role of an information gatherer so that i can bring back the feedback to the universitys relevant people
3562137 in that time i have mainly been a teacher in hospitality and i also taught in management and leadership roles
3562138 then ive gone into a management role for about eight years and was the head of the department of food and allied sciences
3562139 i am also a member of the university of ballarats council their academic board and i am also on the executive committee of the council which puts me in a good position to liaise with people in top management positions
3562140 i do miss the students but i think getting involved with the industry and the community is where my passion is
3562141 im heading off on holidays to cairns for a few days
3562142 the potential has been sitting there but like in the past few years it depends on what unfolds over the warmer months
3562143 weve all become a bit gun shy because of what weve seen
3562144 weve had less rainfall but at the same time the crops are looking equally as good as last year
3562145 we have a little sub soil moisture in some paddocks but we still need good spring rain
3562146 were looking as good as this stage last year or a little better
3562147 you can never get overly confident we just hope everything finishes off nicely
3562148 the money is made from the spring rain we all need the spring rain
3562149 were not blessed with any amount of sub soil moisture at all
3562150 the crops are growing well because theyve been using what theyve been getting
3562151 the spring time that is going to be our critical period
3562152 were probably a little bit in front of this time last year
3562153 theres not as much sub soil moisture but theres more on top
3562154 gee that would have been a more exciting game if the score had been 12 10
3562155 we are hoping in the next few months to have a detailed plan of what the community garden site will look like
3562156 it is something we the council havent been proactive enough on in the past
3562157 its one of a few that the council might have to make in the next few years
3562158 it comes up every now and again where a property has been for sale in an area where council has an overall development plan
3562159 there are a couple of other sites around town we would be interested in should they become available for community space
3562160 it is next to the wesley centre and backs on to the nexus centre so its part of a cultural youth precinct and civic precinct
3562161 already the initial planning has been done by the department of education and childhood development for the plans to be drawn up for the precinct which is a community facility with an education component
3562162 the department of planning and community development has been very supportive
3562163 there is no need to purchase any other land at this stage for development but the government might need to secure additional property
3562164 the clearest message is to come out en masse for this summit
3562165 the summit is necessary to take the next steps forward to upgrade the rail freight network in victoria
3562166 we are asking the public to attend particularly those near the warracknabeal hopetoun and dimboola yaapeet lines because this is their future that hinges on these lines remaining open
3562167 when i found out i felt very happy and excited
3562168 we received verbal confirmation last week from regional arts victoria that funding will not continue
3562169 the program has been extremely successful in the wimmera in increasing access to arts and culture infrastructure developing volunteers skills and networks accessing external funding to enhance festivals and supporting small communities in building events
3562170 this region has a really strong connection with the arts
3562171 festivals like art is and the natimuk frinj festival and the horsham regional art gallery and other private galleries are important
3562172 the arts can really define who we are it is a measure of our society as a whole our artistic and cultural pursuits
3562173 im not sure what kind of message this sends our community
3562174 sport is not everybodys idea of recreation a lot of people get pleasure out of the arts
3562175 but if mr thaksin seeks asylum in britain it will complicate matters

3562184 dr wickham has devoted an amazing amount of energy to spj activities and student membership over the years to the point that she is practically synonymous with spj on this campus
3562185 the bond that she enjoys with students is obvious and inspirational
3562186 in my opinion she is the perfect model for a spj chapter adviser
3562187 she is a highly dedicated professional who knows how to motivate her students to strive for excellence both in the lecture hall and in her capacity as spj adviser dr wickham works tirelessly to inform and educate her students
3562188 i have to give the credit to my students who shared my belief in the importance of an active spj chapter on campus
3562189 they are the ones who posted the flyers supported the programs through their attendance and participation entered the contests and paid the dues sometimes i was the engine with a dozen programming ideas and other times i was the caboose trying to catch up with their ideas it has been a wonderful ride either way

3562235 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3562236 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3562237 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3562238 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3562239 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that

3562342 on the ships i usually work from midnight until 9 in the morning when the guests are asleep
3562343 unless theres scaffolding when we climb 200 feet in the air
3562344 it makes me feel good that someone would appreciate my work and enjoy it
3562345 i am very disappointed in the parti quebecois which instead of encouraging quebec athletes wants to politicize the games and provoke a battle of the rags a battle of the flags
3562346 why do they always have this little bit of bitterness to spoil the party
3562347 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3562348 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3562349 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this

3562368 we represent our 450 to 500 odd members who would all have very various opinions on this and thats one very good reasons in particular why we havent formed a definite view
3562369 we thought the best thing we could do was actually facilitate a public forum involving obviously eminent people with experience in corruption commissions and the like so that we can actually assist by providing a vehicle for discussion rather than making a profound statement on what is necessary
3562370 two are better than one because they have a good return for their work if one falls down his friend can help him up but pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up also if two lie down together they will keep warm but how can one keep warm alone though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves a cord of three strands is not quickly broken

3562372 i think its reasonable to assume that wed see concerts for example being conducted there
3562373 given the noise limitations that we have imposed it would be very difficult for a loud rock festival to be able to take place there i think the limitations are quite stringent and with the annual performance report well be monitoring that very closely
3562374 what if someone is dying at home would you still cancel
3562375 is the motto and build a society with out boundaries
3562376 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3562377 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3562378 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3562379 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand

3562381 no drama instead your words go over my head lets stop hurting each other so we can be alright youre so perfect in bed but still youre f ked in the head everything you say i cant take your lies this is just another romeo and juliet

3562395 companies like google salesforce com zoho and others continue to push the envelope of saas and cloud based technologies hardware vendors like asus and hp are introducing a new breed of devices ideally suited to office 2 0 and end user organizations of all sizes are embracing this new way of computing
3562396 our priority has always been to make sure this demolition is carried out safely and with as little disruption as possible which is why weve opted for the early hours of the morning
3562397 shes scared of mud but her brothers and sisters are quite happy in it

3562404 devastating were just most girls are just torn up about it because she was just such a nice person
3562405 even when others treat you wrong she always treated them with respect and kindness so thats the same as im going to do in honor of her
3562406 she was the kind of person that you would want your children to be its like a piece of us went away with her

3562412 does anyone remember how blinkered goddamn difficult the ice man stage was
3562413 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3562415 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3562416 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3562417 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3562418 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3562419 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3562431 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3562432 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3562433 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3562438 he felt better and decided to do a few things
3562439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3562440 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3562454 not so long ago it seems we all knew a great uncle harold or aunty irene but sadly it seems these names could soon be lost forever
3562455 it is clear that modern parents are increasingly being influenced by fashions and celebrity however we also need to remember that there are now more choices available

3562470 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3562471 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3562472 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3562473 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3562474 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3562475 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3562476 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3562477 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3562478 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3562479 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3562480 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3562481 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3562482 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3562483 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3562484 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3562485 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3562486 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3562487 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3562488 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3562489 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3562490 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3562491 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3562492 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3562493 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3562494 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3562495 oh my god i know the answer to life and the universe
3562496 if i could just get off the toilet and tell someone
3562497 i dont think john mccain has really made his case to hunters and anglers
3562498 things were very different in 2004 everybody knew that george w bush was from texas he was a rancher and that he went hunting we havent seen that from mccain the unknown he really needs to come out as a sportsman neither candidate has talked a lot about the issues that are important to us
3562499 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3562500 sportsmen view john mccain as good company in the great outdoors
3562501 theyre just not sure how much fun barack obama would be in a duck blind
3562502 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3562503 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3562504 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3562505 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3562506 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3562507 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3562508 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3562509 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3562510 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3562511 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3562512 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3562513 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3562514 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3562515 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3562516 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3562517 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3562518 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer

3562565 ciertamente pudo haber otros canales para la introducci n del virus comercio internacional por ejemplo o traslado ilegal y no denunciado de aves de corral esto aumenta el riesgo de que la gripe aviaria se extienda a otros pa ses del oeste de africa

3562571 a todo el mundo le preocupa la situaci n que se vive en catalu a que sin ninguna duda est afectando al resto del estado
3562572 cuando vemos que el propio partido socialista catal n se replantea el apoyo a los presupuestos generales y que est formando un frente en catalu a en el que tambi n participa converg ncia i uni uno se pregunta qu est pasando
3562573 lo nico que hemos visto este mes son desavenencias dentro del psoe sobre la financiaci n
3562574 no hay nada claro ni para canarias ni para el resto de las comunidades
3562575 muchas personas no llegan a final de mes y tienen que abandonar sus casas porque no pueden pagar las hipotecas otras pierden sus trabajos y mientras tanto tenemos un presidente de vacaciones
3562576 con las medidas que ha puesto el gobierno y con las que pondr en marcha la crisis se ir solventando poco a poco
3562577 la situaci n econ mica es grave en todo el mundo pero hay que tener en cuenta que los precios del petr leo han bajado y se han puesto en marcha medidas
3562578 precisamente en canarias el gasto en obra p blica es el mayor de toda espa a
3562579 hay que dejar al gobierno hacer su trabajo es una crisis mundial y no se va a resolver en quince d as del mes de agosto y con una comparecencia
3562580 el m s importante ajuste presupuestario de los ltimos veinte a os
3562581 es algo que ahora se constata con la realidad y que le ha ocurrido al cien por cien de las comunidades aut nomas y al propio
3562582 eso no es un consuelo en absoluto para canarias pero en todo caso habr m s medidas para compensar ese desfase
3562583 para que hagan ajustes empezando por la propia comunidad aut noma de canarias

3562589 thrice obama voted to let doctors and nurses allow these tiny human beings die of neglect and be tossed out with the medical waste how can a man who purports to be a christian justify this if as its advocates contend abortion has to remain legal to protect the life and health mental and physical of the mother how is a mothers life or health in the least threatened by a baby no longer inside her but lying on a table or in a pan fighting for life and breath

3562608 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3562609 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3562610 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3562611 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3562612 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3562613 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3562614 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3562615 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3562616 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3562617 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3562639 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3562640 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3562641 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3562642 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat

3562645 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3562646 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3562647 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

3562652 in 2005 junk mail surpassed what we call first class mail as the majority of what the usps us postal service was delivering
3562653 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry

3562660 aproximadamente la mitad de las parejas con un problema de fondo llegan a las vacaciones siendo conscientes de que lo tienen otra mitad conf a en solucionarlo todo pero los problemas previos van a seguir existiendo lo que ocurre es que hasta que no est s las 24 horas del d a de vacaciones con tu pareja lo del invierno parece una luna de miel convives s lo 5 6 horas y en este tiempo no te apetece discutir los conflictos surgen por el exceso de tiempo de convivencia en el verano
3562661 normalmente por falta de tiempo uno programa las vacaciones de los dos antepone sus intereses a los de su pareja y despu s cuando algo falla en ese programa comienzan los problemas

3562667 we started asking ourselves what would draw in new audiences
3562668 we thought there might be a certain group who might enjoy texting with the musicians obviously not while they are playing and there might be those who would like a play by play description of what is going on
3562669 there are also people who might love to chat about the music and there are people who want to come and have a pure classical experience
3562670 after the concert we will ask for feedback and evaluate the feedback
3562671 this is a research i institution and as musicians we ask ourselves what does this mean for us
3562672 mozart for example wrote in his letters that audiences sometimes clapped for certain chords
3562673 our students are going to make a living in many ways
3562674 our belief is that they will be required to do a lot of things rather than be specialists thats why we want our curriculum to be as fluid as possible
3562675 we are trying to get farther down the flexibility spectrum
3562676 but others clearly will not have a public event as a goal such as a pedagogy ensemble where the students will learn teaching skills
3562677 from the feedback i received at professional conferences last spring many people are very interested to see how this works
3562678 some of our peers are planning to visit this year just to take a look
3562679 the more you talk to him the better the chances he can get you to believe his bullshit and suck you back in

3562681 this is what i miss dude not the bullshit and not the stupid stuff you did and not even the relationship part of the relationship i miss these conversations more than anything i miss arguing with you about stuff i miss watching the news with you at night
3562682 g youre on such a good track lately your life is going so well and even if it isnt exactly what you planned maybe its more of a blessing that it ended up this way but dont let him come back and crap on you some more he could fuck that alllll up if he came back and tried to do the same shit and you know he will you know hes not going to change

3562684 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3562685 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3562686 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3562687 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3562688 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3562689 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3562690 just so you all know we did set a record
3562691 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3562692 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3562693 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3562694 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3562695 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3562696 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3562697 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3562698 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3562699 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3562700 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3562701 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3562702 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3562703 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3562704 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3562705 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3562706 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3562707 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3562708 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3562709 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3562710 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3562711 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3562712 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated

3562714 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3562715 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3562716 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3562717 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3562718 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3562719 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3562720 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3562721 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3562722 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3562723 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3562724 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3562725 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3562726 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3562727 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3562728 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3562729 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3562730 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3562731 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3562732 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3562733 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3562734 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3562735 within the last three months weve had multiple companies racing each other through the doors
3562736 when we typically have little mountain ranges every time the air moves past its pushed up and over
3562737 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
3562738 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
3562739 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
3562740 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
3562741 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
3562742 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
3562743 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
3562744 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable
3562745 a lot of this has been what if until this point
3562746 what i hear is pretty positive support for having sustainable energy for getting away from dependence on foreign oil and the job creation
3562747 the landowner told me that this may provide his family with the opportunity to keep an old time ranch in one piece in their family for several generations
3562748 and that beats the heck out of 100 different ranchettes

3562758 lo hemos repetido con frecuencia y quiero confirmarlo somos pocos un pueblo dividido queremos la reunificaci n con osetia del norte ahora ya no se puede hablar de coexistencia con georgia en el mismo estado
3562759 a library is a place where books are lent research is provided as well as other similar type services
3562760 i do want to be apart from the county library system and for carnegie to have its own board hire its own director its own part time people and its own staff and that the city fund that operation
3562761 in a regional system funding comes from the state and unless theres some prearranged funding agreement between the carnegie library and the county then that money might be diverted somewhere else
3562762 we have a plan were just figuring out the organizational structure

3562766 nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 10 years of age
3562767 when the other team has the ball and i have to go up and tackle them
3562768 that was lucky youd never be able to get him back in goal if hed scored
3562769 we got what we wanted out of this situational scrimmage
3562770 i thought the offense took a little bit of the challenge
3562771 requan is a great leader on the field and off the field
3562772 he has not missed anything hes been at every meeting everything we do inside hes absolutely on the rehab machines and doing everything hes supposed to right now hes not going to let people get down
3562773 hes really done a good job of getting the grasp of the offense ive been impressed with him managing the offense
3562774 what zack has to do is show me more consistency in managing the offense and putting us in the right play hes very capable of doing that if he will challenge himself to make his mechanics consistent
3562775 hes now coming around and conditioning is a little challenge for him with his health status hes coming around to be a pretty disruptive football player im real anxious to see what kind of year he has hes got two years of eligibility left he could be a very dominant defensive lineman
3562776 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3562777 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3562778 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3562779 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3562780 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3562781 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3562782 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3562783 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3562784 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3562785 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3562786 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3562787 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3562788 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3562789 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3562790 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3562791 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3562792 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3562793 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3562794 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3562795 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3562796 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3562797 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3562798 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3562799 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3562800 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3562801 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3562802 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3562803 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3562804 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3562805 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3562806 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3562807 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3562808 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3562809 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3562810 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3562811 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3562812 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3562813 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3562814 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3562815 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3562816 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3562817 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3562818 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3562819 call the law firm of boucher likes mcfadden and mephisto for all your divorce needs well make it like your marriage never happened
3562820 does that sinister mask hide a jealous romeo we may never know because even as i speak the plans have ben given orders to shoot down spidey kong
3562821 i finally get up the courage to ask you out and you say
3562822 she was so convincing that we all thought she was a good actress nobody realized she wasnt acting
3562823 in my heart i think yeah it owuld be nice to know somebody cared enough to be here for me yknow
3562824 were just glad to have them this year and are looking forward to them being there
3562825 we used to sell them a lot of bolts and different things to work on their equipment with
3562826 theyd say we need this that or the other would you meet us up town
3562827 all of these people that are in charge of it and work on it have done business with me for 50 years
3562828 we think it is quite an honor that they asked us
3562829 hes been in the hospital every month this year just about
3562830 so we are counting on his health getting better and then were counting on wanting to do some things
3562831 and had a little thing in his hand and wanted to know where he could get it
3562832 he used to get it from me he said he couldnt get it at home depot anymore
3562833 we had geared our business up for the homebuilder theyre just not doing the business like they were
3562834 its one of the funniest things i cant quit dreaming about the store
3562835 ill dream that my son and i are waiting on people getting up a plumbing order or doing something
3562836 i said well good thank goodness its time to move on
3562837 i told somebody that i had a dream that that would happen one day
3562838 hes done a wonderful job with it john has done an outstanding job with that building
3562839 when we ride by people say are you sorry youre not up there
3562840 were just glad that we were there for the time we were and now were glad that were not
3562841 i would be able to spend time with my wife and wed be able to do things with my family with my grandchildren to see them in different school activities and ive been able to do that
3562842 were glad weve got time that we dont have to say well weve got to get back to the store
3562843 there was a long time when we couldnt get to anything on time on a saturday night or any night we couldnt go and do something because wed have to get through here at the store first
3562844 we couldnt believe when they told us they were going to move to newnan and build them a home
3562845 oh my god i wish i was a lesbian she is arousingly brilliant
3562846 is so the truth and facts will be allowed to surface without the misuse of our words and biased opinions from mainstream local media
3562847 we will use this opportunity to happily clear up any doubts or uncertainties pertaining to our case the false allegations against us as well as the your black muslim bakery establishment
3562848 with all the biased reporting by the local mainstream can the bakery 4 bey and three other defendants in the kidnapping and torture case still receive a fair trial
3562849 i am not locked up on any charges connected to the death of chauncey bailey i would not be locked up now had the government not used the tragedy of chauncey bailey as a way to divert peoples attention from the false allegations i am presently being locked up for
3562850 i am not surprised when i see and hear the local media and newspapers try to connect myself and the bakery to the death of chauncey bailey as i have stated many times before myself nor the bakery had nothing to do with the chauncey bailey killing
3562851 as i have stated before i was never very fond of mr bailey but one thing he did not deserve was to be killed
3562852 we are very tuned into north carolina cutcliffe said recently
3562853 when i started recruiting here back in the early 80s at tennessee there were about 5 5 million people in this state and the football was good we recruited some exceptional players out of this state that are still playing in the nfl and were first round draft picks
3562854 but when i took this job i told our staff the projection of the census is between 9
3562855 hes one of those kids and i know youve heard this before that he plays faster in a game that he is normally said northwest whitfield coach mike falleur said
3562856 i dont know how to explain that other than ive never seen anybody catch him and ive never seen anybody that he does not run down as a corner hes physical and hes got great speed
3562857 i was devastated because this is my main source of income for my family it was just devastating to us i was physically ill literally i just thought i was going to pass out once these chickens are shipped out in about four weeks this chicken farm will basically be out of business
3562858 you get loans on your chicken houses to build them we owe probably 400 000 at least on the chicken houses so if there is no chicken to supply them we have no income to pay that payment or live off of so its very scary
3562859 were trying to become a play in oil and gas and theres a lot of resources there that we havent tapped that were going to try to tap
3562860 myself and other farmers we dont know whats going to happen what we are going to do we dont have any other contracts
3562861 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3562862 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3562863 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3562864 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3562865 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3562866 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3562867 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3562868 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3562869 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3562870 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3562871 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3562872 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3562873 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3562874 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3562875 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3562876 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3562877 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3562878 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3562879 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3562880 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3562881 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3562882 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3562883 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3562884 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3562885 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3562886 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3562887 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3562888 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3562889 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3562890 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3562891 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3562892 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3562893 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3562894 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3562895 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3562896 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3562897 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3562898 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3562899 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3562900 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3562901 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3562902 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3562903 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3562904 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3562905 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3562906 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3562907 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3562908 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3562909 i can safely say that yu suzuki is in fact still a sega employee
3562910 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3562911 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3562912 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3562913 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3562914 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3562915 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3562916 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3562917 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3562918 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3562919 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3562920 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3562921 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3562922 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3562923 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3562924 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3562925 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3562926 telstras turnaround continues to gain momentum on all fronts with our fiscal year guidance met or exceeded for the third consecutive year
3562927 we have redefined our business by investing to create competitive advantages and this value differentiation strategy underpinned by our customer centric transformation sets us apart
3562928 telstras networks products and services offer clear advantages over our competitors a fact reflected in increased broadband and mobile revenue market shares
3562929 our next g network investment has accelerated mobiles growth delivering double digit growth for the third consecutive half and continuing our stand out performance as customers see the value of our superior mobile offerings
3562930 is tesco right to compete on price with battery chickens
3562931 basically this was as the market had thought so its not really having much of an impact what happened on wall street overnight is much bigger
3562932 that farmers received just over one cent for each pint of the brew
3562933 it seemed appropriate especially considering the shape we were in when we started
3562934 we had to become the gutter twins because thats how we were perceived
3562935 i hate to say this but theres a more spiritual nature than usual
3562936 i couldnt tell you what saturnalias theme is but theres a seeking of transcendence thats new i have never written songs like this before its a different temple im visiting
3562937 its totally different musically but theres always something about it that reminds me of theres a riot goin on
3562938 its very intuitive and trancelike changing when it wants to
3562939 i tried to shake off any kind of western song structure we were comfortable riding the groove and letting it take us where it needed to go
3562940 when we actually decided to make a record we agreed that it should be different from anything weve done before
3562941 if something sounded like anything wed ever done it was rejected
3562942 collaborating for me is what keeps me interested in music
3562943 having mario come in and play was a real thrill
3562944 when mario was playing his part we were staring through the window jumping up and down like little boys
3562945 in 2003 i got a call from an italian journalist asking me about the gutter twins
3562946 i said whats that a group with you and mark lanegan he replied i told him i hadnt heard about it but it sounded interesting
3562947 i called him and he said oh yeah were gonna make a record and its going to be called gutter twins
3562948 for most of the record we wrote the lyrics together and that was pretty unique
3562949 hes more minimalist and im more maximalist and both tendencies are present throughout the record
3562950 id never written a song that complete or that personal in front of someone ever before
3562951 we finished it in less than an hour at the end he said the song is great as is but ive come up with two more verses the words hed written were phenomenal then he taught me how to sing it marks a very giving performer hes there for the song not for him
3562952 but when two people form a common thread it merges two disparate personalities into one that we were able to do so collectively made it unique to both of us as such this album truthfully captures where we started and where weve ended up
3562953 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3562954 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3562955 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3562956 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3562957 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3562958 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3562959 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3562960 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3562961 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3562962 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3562963 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3562964 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3562965 id prefer that it included a super majority requirement and an explicit set of reservations analogous to the constitutions bill of rights but weve learned from experience that putting national lawmaking authority solely in the hands of 537 people in washington results in a broken process dominated by corporate and sectional interests and geared toward protecting those interests rather than our rights
3562966 while many libertarians distrust democracy and fear its devolution into mob rule
3562967 it seems unlikely to me that the american people would legislate as corruptly and incompetently as their representatives in washington have the national initiative provides for a period of deliberation and debate with any new law requiring affirmation by voters in two separate elections meanwhile we frequently hear that congress has passed new legislation without waiting for it to be printed so that they can actually read it
3562968 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3562969 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3562970 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3562971 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3562972 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3562973 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3562974 could be the most effective of any missing persons notice
3562975 all he left was a note to huang her coach saying im going far away i want you to treat wenjun as your own daughter and help her do her very best
3562976 what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the heart of man imagined what god has prepared for those who love him
3562977 now is the judgment of this world now will the ruler of this world be cast out and i when i am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
3562978 now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ have come for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god
3562979 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it for what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul for what can a man give in return for his soul for whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him will the son of man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
3562980 at this time were just moving forward with the case as it stands
3562981 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3562982 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3562983 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3562984 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3562985 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3562986 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3562987 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3562988 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3562989 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3562990 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3562991 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3562992 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3562993 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3562994 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3562995 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3562996 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3562997 no puedo hablar ni caminar bien pero ya tengo memoria de lo que pas me golpearon me torturaron casi me matan sin haber cometido alg n delito
3562998 me pegaron con sus toletes y ca al suelo ah me dieron de patadas en la columna y me desmay me pararon y me llevaron adonde se encontraba un ret n sin dejar de golpearme en ese lugar m s de 20 polic as me golpearon hasta tirarme al suelo y de eso hay muchas fotograf as hasta alejandro barrita comandante de la polic a auxiliar asesinado el 30 de enero me peg con un garrote

3563010 its hard to imagine a political candidate generating that sort of excitement
3563011 never would it have occurred to me that a political speech would have a secondary market
3563012 if we were to attack iraq now alone or with few allies it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us

3563015 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3563016 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3563017 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3563018 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3563019 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3563020 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

3563035 we live in 1940 house and are remodeling our unfinished half lit basement currently we are in search of interior door w small glass for our new 2nd bathroom since the bathroom has a big window would like to use some of sun light thru its entrance doors glass panel to the dark hallway area we have found a couple of salvaged doors we love but they are solid hemlock fir doors without glass now we are wondering if we could cut the top panel out and install a reed glass instead i know we could just order brand new one like that but it will cost 400 door its outside our budget well ive never done this but i have seen it done a few times and its a great way to recycle salvage a great solid wood door and give it new life and some added functionality solid wood doors are very expansive and honestly arent as good as the older doors this modification will work well because the doors back then were indeed made out of solid wood and built with craftsmanship the process is actually pretty simple first youll need to remove the wood panel that will serve as the window pane this can be done several ways probably the best two ways that i can think of are to use either a circular saw or a router with a straight cutting bit if youre going to use a router you could make a simple jig to clamp to the door that would ensure you cut the exact size you want the key here is to make sure you dont cut too far into the corners with both methods youll need to finish the corner cuts with a handsaw in order to get nice clean corners once you cut out the panel youll want to sand the edges and treat the raw wood with either paint or urethane in order to protect the wood from rot next youll need a piece of glass thats slightly smaller than the window opening i suggest making the glass approximately 1 4

3563041 we were determined to bring the very best forthcoming games to the showdown and weve certainly achieved that with left 4 dead were hugely excited to be able to show it to pc gamer showdown attendees as were sure its going to be one of the top games of 2008 and live up to valves fearsomely high standards
3563042 left 4 dead is a new type of co operative action experience one that must be played to truly appreciate were delighted to work with lg and the folks at one of our favourite gaming magazines to put on the first public exhibition of l4d in britain we hope the attendees of the show find the game as exciting as we do and we look forward to meeting folks there and giving away a few l4d prizes
3563043 the campaign is not too short and not too long
3563044 its longer than call of duty 4 its shorter than a final fantasy game its different for different players when the end starts to come you want it to come but when you get there you want more its really well crafted
3563045 notice how im talking in terms of feelings instead of in terms of number of hours thats important it permeates everything we do the stats arent important the feelings and experiences we have are
3563046 a game im not interested in can be 100 000 hours long and i dont care maybe if it was one hour and all the attention was put on that one hour the game might be something i could get interested in meanwhile if something is awesome but too short i dont feel value for my investment the goal is to find the sweet spot
3563047 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3563048 i love that daniel hunts aliens down and i really really like the plot in the story that he wants to get revenge on an alien that killed his parents who were also alien hunters i think daniels parents would be very proud of daniel for continuing his battle i like daniel and i think its really cool that he can recreate the energy in the universe and can make it into things i wish i could do that if i could met daniel id ask him if i could help him on his next adventure im also actually glad my mom reviewed this book with me because now i can go read some of his other books before school starts back up and i have homework to do again

3563052 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3563053 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3563055 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3563056 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3563057 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3563058 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3563059 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3563060 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3563061 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3563062 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3563063 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3563064 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3563065 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3563066 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3563067 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3563068 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

3563072 it is truly unfortunate that the aclu apparently has nothing better to do than to file baseless charges against a dedicated public servant like judge james deweese
3563073 a first year law student looking at the facts and law of this case could have told the aclu that there never was a legal basis for this ridiculous contempt charge
3563074 were pleased that the federal court acted expeditiously in tossing out this latest gambit in the aclus ongoing harassment of judge deweese
3563075 the court can find no principled basis upon which to find that or even fully consider whether the new display is constitutionally impermissible
3563076 it was clear from the start of this latest episode in the aclus harassment of judge deweese that the aclu was choosing to ignore current law regarding public displays that include the decalogue in an educational or historical setting
3563077 the u s supreme court has made it perfectly clear in cases brought by the aclu itself that government officials are permitted to discuss acknowledge and display the ten commandments in a context that underscores the role played by decalogue in history civilization or ethics any reasonable person can see that this is precisely what judge deweeses current display does
3563078 the only question is whose morality because all morality is based on faith there is no such thing as religious neutrality in law or morality
3563079 its a good thing weve taken that tax off people but now its impacting sales tax revenue
3563080 its impossible to envision this not having a critical and negative impact on many of our educational programs
3563081 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3563082 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3563083 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3563084 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3563085 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3563086 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3563087 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3563088 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3563089 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3563090 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3563091 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3563092 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3563093 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3563094 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3563095 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3563096 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3563097 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3563098 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3563099 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3563100 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3563101 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3563102 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3563103 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3563104 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3563105 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3563106 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3563107 i dont want to beat myself up and i wont
3563108 i am actually happy if someone had told me yesterday that i was going to come fourth i would find it hard to believe especially after i pulled it back from the situation i was in at first it was a little bit disappointing because i was close to a medal but i am so happy i really am
3563109 well i will tell you that in a few weeks
3563110 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3563111 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3563112 our crops have failed it must be the uzbeks again
3563113 nothing less than to provide the best and stickiest internet experience available anywhere
3563114 almost all organizations of any reasonable size have some kind of strategic planning
3563115 this is consistent with our view that consumer spending will slow markedly over the next several quarters
3563116 this in turn would be another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3563117 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3563118 create a vision for this building which will enable apple to build an international flagship store
3563119 should not be underestimated and has been essential in being able to attract a retailer of apples calibre
3563120 in order to understand the profound affect sic the company can have on an emerging area as well as its enhancement to an historical building in the meatpacking district
3563121 apple is unique at the current time in terms of its offer and ability to retail within architecturally significant buildings unlike many other retailers it seeks to restore and enhance these spaces allowing its brand to sit within property that are sufficiently important so as not to detract its store at regent street is a very good example
3563122 without exception apple will work tirelessly with its partners cities and communities to create the most appropriate solution for these special buildings and an unrivaled experience for its customers
3563123 included the introduction of the apple logo within the new glazing on the piazza elevation
3563124 further to comments from the city council design officer these have been omitted from the scheme
3563125 the design approach reflects the importance given to improving the historic character of the building the proposals are intended to provide a sensitive response in order to preserve and enhance the quality of the historic fabric of the building while ensuring the buildings sic viable future through the creation of a unit that can meet the demands of a modern retailer and officer occpuier
3563126 to achieve this the apple design team have adopted a design approach which is distinctly bespoke in its treatment of the building this is apparent from the shift in chosen materials which are a total transition from the pallette of materials typically used in apple stores across the world
3563127 omputers are rapidly changing the nature of the work for most accountants and auditors

3563129 its corruption prevention recommendations in relation to all segments of this investigation
3563130 normally the commissions investigation reports include a section that details corruption prevention issues and recommendations
3563131 however the railcorp investigation has raised a significant number of corruption issues across all segments of the investigation the same corruption issues have arisen in several previous icac investigations into railcorp to deal with these serious issues the final report in this series will canvas all of the corruption prevention issues raised during the various segments of the current investigation
3563132 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3563133 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3563134 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3563135 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

3563150 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem through committed action and vigorous enforcement they can provide a powerful and much needed deterrent

3563154 from circles around palazzo chigi nerve centre of direction of italian intelligence it is noted that the non authenticity of the video is testified from the fact that osama bin laden in it confessed that al qaeda would have been the author of the attack of the 11 september to the twin towers in new york while all of the democratic circles of america and of europe with in the forefront those of the italian centre left now know well that the disastrous attack was planned and realized by the american cia and mossad with the help of the zionist world to put under accusation the arabic countries and to persuade the western powers to intervene in iraq and afghanistan for this no word of solidarity arrived to silvio berlusconi who has been the author of the brilliant falsification neither from the quirinale nor from palazzo chigi nor from representatives of the centre left

3563156 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3563157 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3563158 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together

3563165 hi honey i was just calling to check in with you about wednesday
3563166 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3563167 he juzgado como me gustar a que me juzgaran a mi
3563168 entonces la cr tica es por que cuando fue la marcha para concientizarnos por el calentamiento global o la concientizaci n de que pronto escacearan los alimentos por que necesitamos gasolina y m s cosas por el estilo nadie participa que cada d a nos siguen imponiendo m s y m s impuestos y tributos al pueblo y no decimos nada que as como salieron hoy e hicieron fiesta y conciertos bien algo de cultura no va mal

3563171 los magos son artistas de la atenci n y la consciencia manipulan estos procesos cognitivos de forma dram tica actuaci n tras actuaci n
3563172 el mago no s lo desv a la atenci n de los espectadores a nivel espacial sino tambi n temporal es probable que el truco lo haya realizado antes de que parezca que lo est haciendo el lenguaje corporal y la posici n de los ojos tambi n son fundamentales cuando hacen magia su cuerpo siempre est relajado lo que da la impresi n de que no sucede nada y entra en tensi n cuando fingen que algo importante est ocurriendo
3563173 ves una cosa y luego sucede otra lo que nos hace concluir que la primera es causa de la segunda cuando no tiene por qu ser as
3563174 sus espect culos suelen recordarse por una serie de momentos puntuales los m s espectaculares pero que no son determinantes para desvelar el truco para eso tendr amos que grabar la actuaci n en v deo y visionarla varias veces fij ndonos en un punto distinto en cada ocasi n a n as es posible que no logremos comprenderlo
3563175 debe parecer que cada movimiento tiene un objetivo nunca repetir de manera exacta el mismo truco y emplear la aparente repetici n para cerrar todas las puertas a cualquier posible explicaci n del truco que no sea la magia
3563176 llevar estas t cnicas al laboratorio podr a ampliar el conocimiento sobre las bases neuronales y la comprensi n de los mecanismos que controlan la atenci n c mo funcionan y c mo manipularlos
3563177 sabemos que un conjunto de magos lee revistas de divulgaci n cient fica y presta mucha atenci n a las neurociencias cognitivas sin embargo la comunidad neurocient fica no atiende a los magos a pesar de que hay quien sostiene que es un arte que ya estaba presente en el antiguo egipto

3563183 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3563184 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3563185 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3563186 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3563187 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3563188 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate

3563195 the tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living
3563196 thus the awakening of the dead serves the purpose of glorifying new struggles not of parodying the old but of magnifying the given task in the imagination not recoiling from its solution in reality but finding once more the spirit for new struggles not making a ghost walk again
3563197 if tamil nadu could do it and reap such gains heck we can do it better
3563198 the old blocks and resistances to steady growth are overcome the forces making for economic progress expand and come to dominate society self sustained growth becomes its normal condition

3563437 mom youd better cut that plant back its blocking the entrance to the house
3563438 what gorgeous color dont touch it id be happy to inconvenience myself for that plant
3563439 although it might benefit some kids at the top what youre going to do is leave a lot of kids at the bottom
3563440 well here i am what are your other two wishes
3563441 theyre back and theyre willing to stand up for their interests and the west doesnt have a lot of options
3563442 if you give the russians a chance they will take advantage of it they will play their own game and by their own rules
3563443 its hard to see how russia will pull out of south ossetia and abkhazia now georgia now will have a big hole in it
3563444 probably believed rather naively he might get more support from the united states
3563445 you could probably say georgia triggered it but russia was clearly ready to respond
3563446 the straw that broke the camels back was saakashvili and georgia moving into south ossetia
3563447 the west does not have a whole lot of leverage over russia right now
3563448 very much shows that russia calls the shots in the region
3563449 theres going to be a serious debate in the west now about how we deal with russia
3563450 not demonstrated that this case warrants the intervention of this court
3563451 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3563452 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3563453 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3563454 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3563455 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3563456 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3563457 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3563458 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3563459 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3563460 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3563461 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3563462 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3563463 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3563464 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3563465 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3563466 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3563467 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3563468 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3563469 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3563470 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3563471 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3563472 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3563473 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3563474 it is important to ask about suicidal thoughts regularly especially when disease is worsening symptoms are increasing or the patient is entering a more serious phase of illness creating an environment where these issues can be openly explored without being judged is critical
3563475 without thaksin people can talk i think theres a feeling that we should have a new beginning
3563476 you can see that within the political class there are some true believers in thaksin but theres an awful lot of others who went with him because he was the man of the moment
3563477 if samak can hold the party together and strike the right compromises with thaksins antagonists maybe his government will last but most people are betting it wont
3563478 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3563479 her ninth im exhausted with just one i cant imagine how is it that shes still alive
3563480 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3563481 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3563482 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3563483 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3563484 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3563485 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3563486 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3563487 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3563488 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3563489 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3563490 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3563491 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3563492 and here i am sitting in a bar with my beer while my wife is off watching all the kids and i think to myself i had better buy her some flowers
3563493 because i managed to get some girl to marry me
3563494 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3563495 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3563496 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3563497 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3563498 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3563499 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3563500 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3563501 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3563502 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3563503 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3563504 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3563505 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3563506 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3563507 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3563511 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
3563512 sometimes people look at your profile and see something that makes them think disqualifies them from contacting you

3563514 beck you need to practice these lessons not just read them
3563515 what can the author possibly mean that nothing means anything that isnt true

3563526 muchas personas de la tercera edad piensan que para dormir deben tomar pastillas y eso a la larga produce adicci n si uno sigue las indicaciones para una buena higiene del sue o las pastillas debieran ir dej ndose los senescentes debieran asumir que a su edad duermen menos que antes por lo tanto deben poner en pr ctica las indicaciones que se le dan aqu en el consultorio

3563529 i think its a reasonable expectation that they will cave again and if they dont were more ready to go to the polls than they are
3563530 have pushed the country to the brink of a recession
3563531 its no wonder they are playing tarzan with their juvenile taunts
3563532 based on a sense of compassion and desire to see these pensioners treated fairly for an error that they were not responsible for
3563533 this administrative error occurred under the previous liberal government in 2004
3563534 the minister has received assurances from the commissioner that measures have been implemented to ensure that this will not happen again
3563535 the overpayment is the result of an administrative error delay or oversight on the part of a public servant
3563536 the rcmp have undertaken to ensure that financial control measures are in place which will achieve results that are in line with best practices and industry standards
3563537 its trying to upgrade you but there arent any seats available in that bucket but those seats you see are for sale and will be released day of departure
3563538 this is clearly one of our most diverse and international classes in a long time

3563542 im a smart guy im not saying im a coach or anything but i know our defense needs rest if we can run the ball keep the clock moving and let our defense be in a good position there you go
3563543 if we can start breaking those 4 or 5 or 6 yard runs its gonna bring that safety down and then were one on one on the outside
3563544 right now i feel like marvin harrison and reggie wayne are the standard bearers
3563545 i would love to put us up there but youve also got t j houshmandzadeh and chad johnson in the mix with the cincinnati bengals
3563546 as for us we need to prove ourselves as a duo but we do pose a threat on paper so well see
3563547 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3563548 ugh too many people do this now its not cool anymore
3563549 this is going to be very good for all of the receivers not just roy and calvin
3563550 this is going to really open things up because teams are going to have to pay attention to the run and try to stop roy and calvin
3563551 when a team starts to be able to dominate the line and run the ball you can see the way it changes the chemistry and the energy levels thats what we have to have
3563552 the hardest part is all the practices without any games now that we have started playing games were almost home
3563553 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
3563554 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3563555 theyre only as daring as their target demographic allows them to be
3563556 its a lot harder to be bold and daring when youre designing something for a more middle class larger group of people i see it all the time at school someone designs something ridiculously expensive and their target market board is filled with shots of young incredibly rich people cut out from magazines
3563557 that gos version stood out for its minimalistic approach high production quality and unlikely leading male character a biggest video in the blog world
3563558 drivers will slow down to look at anything something as simple as a couch dumped in a roadside ditch can send minor shudders of curiosity through the traffic flow traffic is jammed with these
3563559 if the challenge is to be graded on objectivity thoroughness discipline and sincerity it passes with flying colors
3563560 what carr excels at where his gifts as a journalist shine is explaining how an addicts life works the economics of it the ad hoc social web the quotidian feel of the thing its an essay in urban typology worthy of balzac at his keenest and least windy
3563561 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned
3563562 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3563563 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3563564 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3563565 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3563566 why didnt they target the buyers at s amp p 1500

3563568 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3563569 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3563570 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3563571 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3563572 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3563573 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3563574 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3563575 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers

3563584 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3563585 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3563586 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3563587 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them

3563591 bigpond now gives ipod users an alternative place to purchase their favourite music in a format that will work on their player
3563592 bigpond is changing the online music game by creating a truly open world that puts consumers in the driving seat
3563593 the future of the music industry relies on the growth in legitimate digital music sales
3563594 and we can only have a healthy digital music industry when consumers have the opportunity to purchase music any where anytime and with the capacity to load it onto any device they choose
3563595 this is a very credible given the challenging environment for retailer
3563596 the slowdown in consumer spending did impact sales with like for like sales negative for the second half
3563597 july trading met expectations due to a positive response to new season ranges
3563598 in addition comparative store growth for july was also positive providing good momentum going into the new financial year
3563599 these along with our other brands autograph crossroads katies and millers should give specialty fashion the ability to potentially open 30 35 net new stores a year
3563600 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3563601 workshop demonstrated for me the complexity of the work that we must do as leaders to change our culture first by looking at the very behavior choices we make that hold us back
3563602 salary if im the right person for the job im confident that we can come to an agreement before we discuss salary lets make certain that i am the right person
3563603 im sure you pay a fair salary and i clearly understand that i need to make you more money than i cost so im sure that when the time comes we can come to a fair salary agreement
3563604 im very interested in this position and im a little concerned that a discussion of salary at this point could screen me out or box me in
3563605 from my research i estimate that positions like this for a person with my qualifications pay between x and y what can you do in that range
3563606 we dont need afghan style burquas to disappear as women we disappear in reverse by revamping and revealing our bodies to meet externally imposed visions of female beauty
3563607 taking a final shot before she removes her wedding gown and she asked can i have my dress framed hehehe
3563608 if an alien came down to this planet and said present me with your best athlete to compete in a series of athletic events if you win you can keep your planet if you lose we shall destroy your planet
3563609 i highly caution you to think about it before moving the train
3563610 as you can see benjamin school district 25 gets much higher scores while spending less money per student
3563611 when i lived in elmhurst they had three school districts before consolidating into one
3563612 as far as i knew the education got better and the taxes went down
3563613 i also think some parents dont appreciate how hard it is to buy a home
3563614 the reduction in council rates and land taxes are big issues they are the most efficient ways to fund government but they are taxes people cant avoid so thats why it gets shot down in the press so often
3563615 generally we just wanted any renters to be able to tell their story on whats going on out in the rental queues and the dark bedrooms we have to dwell in
3563616 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3563617 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation

3563621 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3563622 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3563623 i call it a great beginning toward not just accountability but toward the kind of transparency that has been lacking in the clerical culture not just in the archdiocese of chicago but elsewhere
3563624 it isnt the end it isnt a solution but a beginning to a more cooperative solution to what remains a crisis
3563625 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3563626 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3563627 old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition
3563628 but the change that he so gracefully is articulating is more renewal than departure
3563629 i think well wait for chuck to make that announcement
3563630 its difficult to walk away from your nominee but you have to put your country first
3563631 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3563632 have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that
3563633 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3563634 we see a significant number of calls for services out of this and anecdotally we hear about unreported crime
3563635 this place is starting to look like a trailer park

3563640 math didnt make him kill it just made him hard to catch
3563641 how in the world did you overlook this story of feminist movie of the 1980s actually as a female colleague said to me after seeing it that movie says that to be a female mathematician you have to be ugly neurotic and a bad mother since i have spent considerable time researching and writing about kovalevskaya i concur mathematically they missed the point entirely about kovalevskaya on the plus side where else would you see actors portraying weierstrass and mittag leffler
3563642 on the personal side they also got it wrong i remember thinking meg ryan was hardly the ideal actress to play einsteins brilliant niece in iq but shed have been about right physically with her hair dyed brown to play kovalevskaya instead they got an extremely homely swedish actress to play the part and they made her a temperamental prima donna at her first lecture in stockholm actually she was diffident to the extreme and always afraid she wasnt doing a good enough job as for my colleagues comments well kovalevskaya was neurotic and a bad mother but she wasnt ugly a century after her death though she still leaves a legacy of two very brilliant mathematical results
3563643 p s there is a mountain on the far side of the moon that the soviets named after kovalevskaya their robot space ship luna 3 was the first to photograph the far side of the moon i presume thats the reason for the title though no reference is made to it in the movie either at the beginning or the end
3563644 you mentioned that in the movie its my turn 1980 except for all too brief glimpse of the proof of the snake lemma of homological algebra the rest of the film is math free but actually there are some tid bits scattered here and there throughout jill has an exchange with a precocious boy probably junior high school age about prime numbers this was a big disappointment for me mathematically precocious kids this age are a lot smarter than was represented in the exchange at one point some university administrator probably a dean mentions to jill clayburgh that group theory is a really hard area to work in i wish our own administrators would believe that jills father at one point introduces his daughter as a mathematician who is working in finite simple groups how many group theorists have parents who know what they do also i heard as an anecdote that this scene had to be edited the father had first introduced his daughter as someone working in the area of finite simple abelian groups a mathematician or someone knowledgeable about the subject present during the screening broke out in laughter on hearing this jill at one point working on the back of an envelope is frustrated that she cant quite get this 2 fusion problem to work out the movie ends on an up beat note mathematically when the obnoxious grad student and jill share in a rather cryptic exchange some clever insight that would lead to the solution of the classification problem interestingly enough 1980 the year of the movie is the more or less agreed date that the finite simple groups were classified

3563678 people are saying they like the transparency factor but they dont like prices being fixed for 24 hours

3563752 leaders at all ages have to be willing to hear the bad news over and over and still see a silver lining
3563753 do i detect any difference between now and when i was 70 a little but there is nothing significantly diminished
3563754 am i a better executive than i was at 47 in some ways absolutely i think less in terms of me and more for others i dont have the same level of enthusiasm but i can inspire others more easily
3563755 there is a prime age like wine aged or seasoned executives establish credibility
3563756 there will be someone a lot better than me long before that
3563757 its an all consuming role i dont know many ceos who are effective more than 15 or 20 years
3563758 some companies use a mandatory retirement age to avoid a potentially awkward conversion and to provide younger leaders with a visible path to higher office
3563759 if the company is objectively managed changes in leadership will happen when appropriate making arbitrary limits unnecessary
3563760 experience is not about having more answers its about asking the right questions
3563761 age does raise questions but i would not write someone off at 70 because of age itself

3563766 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3563767 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3563768 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3563769 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3563770 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3563771 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3563773 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3563774 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3563775 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3563776 not to to remove posts without a good faith belief that the post being flagged violates these tou
3563777 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3563778 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3563779 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3563780 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3563781 yes i fled to another country survival depended on it
3563782 when i heard i was selected it left me speechless
3563783 when you look at the list of past academic all americans of the year it is an impressive list and to know that i was the first person to win the award twice i am truly honored i had always set high goals for myself when i came to nebraska but those were always focused around volleyball such as being an all american and earning academic all american honors i never thought i would be compared to the best student athletes from other sports across the country for an award such as this and to be chosen as the academic all american of the year twice is something i would have never dreamed of
3563784 it was a lifestyle choice i made early on i didnt come to college and think now i have to study more education was always a priority in my family growing up i was going to college to get an education and having the opportunity to play volleyball was a bonus realizing that my academics were my priority i was fortunate to have people such as dennis leblanc and keith zimmer in our academic office they understood my personality and were always there to help me out they were mentors to me and were always there to give advice and help balancing a demanding major and a high level sport takes a strong commitment and dennis and keith were able to break things down for me and took care of so many things without them it would have been overwhelming
3563785 with nearly 12 000 student athletes being nominated for academic all america each year and considering the number of athletes competing in intercollegiate sports to reach the epitome of what it means to be a successful student athlete and be selected as the best of the best is quite an amazing achievement

3563825 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3563826 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3563827 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety

3563834 well talk about cafeteria procedures pick up and drop off times and all that other good information theyll need to know
3563835 not only will we have a power point to help with information but well be going through all of the things students will be involved with like physical education our library and our computer lab
3563836 were also going to have pam payne a behavior coach available to help with any concerns
3563837 the students and their parents will be learning about the basic year round procedures theyll need to know
3563838 theyll be meeting their teachers learning about daily procedures like dropping off and picking up and well also have transportation and cafeteria representatives available to answer any questions
3563839 the point of the meet and greet is to make both the students and the parents feel more comfortable
3563840 of course the students will still be a little anxious on the first day but they will have already met their teachers so theyll be looking forward to going to class
3563841 the meet and greet is a good thing because that keeps the students from having to go through so much on the first day
3563842 at our meet and greet the students will be able to pick up their schedules and meet their teachers
3563843 its a come and go type of event and we wont be having any kind of formal meeting but the counselors will be available to discuss the schedules with our students and their parents
3563844 some of our parents are concerned about the workload their students are under at our school but by having the team concept a team of teachers who cover all core subjects work together
3563845 we try to relieve parent anxiety by letting them know since teachers are working together their students arent going to have a lot of tests on the same day
3563846 the 120 students in each team are all served within that team and we have four seventh grade teams and four eighth grade teams
3563847 weve found the team system to be really successful because kids dont fall through the cracks they have an identity which is really important at this grade level
3563848 mankind states that if we do not vaccinate our child he she may become sick and die mankind also states that an unvaccinated child may cause others to become sick and die this principle contradicts the peace and balance that i seek in my journey to god it also contradicts the love i feel for mankind as an instrument of jesus christ
3563849 the practice of the board of education has been to meet with the parents to ask them questions with regard to their religious beliefs
3563850 the board has been doing this for x number of years
3563851 there have been other matters litigated both before the commissioner and courts and neither have ever said that the school is not permitted to conduct this type of a meeting in fact it is encouraged
3563852 as a state we have to sort through all those questions and answer them

3563919 its easy to become immune to stories about student debt but this increase is not just another rise some students are facing real financial hardship
3563920 even so the advantages of having a degree still outweigh the costs and the push survey shows that with high quality advice and information students can keep their debts while still enjoying the benefits of university
3563921 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3563922 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3563923 our research shows that prospective students need far more information advice and guidance about how to manage their own finances
3563924 when they leave home for the first time many students are unaware of the costs of everyday life and how debt can mount up
3563925 government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt

3563959 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3563960 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences

3563991 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3563992 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3563993 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3564058 these food to fuel mandates were meant to move america toward energy independence and mitigate global climate change but the evidence irrefutably demonstrates that this policy is not delivering on either goal in fact it is causing environmental harm and contributing to a global food crisis
3564059 i think very definitely there is a clear connection between our ethanol use and world hunger
3564060 by the end of the 2006 7 crop year over 2 billion bushels of corn 19 percent of the harvested crop were used to produce ethanol
3564061 higher corn prices motivated farmers to increase corn acreage at the expense of other crops such as soybeans and cotton raising their prices as well
3564062 there are many factors that contribute to rising food prices including government induced demand for ethanol rising oil and gasoline prices strong economic growth in poorer countries and a general weakening of the u s dollar against other currencies
3564063 but when 20 percent of u s corn production is being diverted from the dinner table to the gas tank we can confidently say that the ethanol mandate has had and will continue to have a lasting impact on the price of food
3564064 the renewable fuels standard was based on the sound premise that america needs a reliable renewable and environmentally beneficial alternative to current carbon intensive fuels but any solutions we face must be sustainable for the environment and for people
3564065 remove incentives to produce ethanol act of 2008 h r 5911 would do exactly what its title says flakes bill would repeal all renewable fuel standards repeal tax credits for ethanol producers and repeal tariffs and duties on imported ethanol
3564066 congress surely did not intend to raise fuel prices by incentivizing ethanol but thats precisely whats happened a jump in food prices is the last thing our economy needs right now
3564067 the facts are on the table ethanol is not the majority increase in food prices
3564068 only a small part of this problem is driven by ethanol

3564077 the enemy is strong they are fast they are quick witted they are willing to die for what they believe in and you are nothing more a sack of shit at the end of their boots
3564078 you now understand what happens when you fuck around like some fucking schoolgirl imagine youre out on the field and acting like a brainless shit and break your arm the enemy is not going to help you up and drag your ass to the nearest dennys he is going to make you suffer because you are nothing you are a nobody
3564079 you need to understand one thing you festering stack of dog shit around this field i am god around this training field i am the master of the fucking universe and you are less than bacteria
3564080 what the hell are you men doing get your comrade to the medical station now
3564081 emmanuel harding im here to take command of this squad and im extremely disappointed to see the sort of conduct theyve had to endure
3564082 do you have any fucking idea who i am son
3564083 i do sir and i have to say your methods of molding young soldiers is deplorable and despicable
3564084 you have no fucking clue who you are dealing with harding
3564085 but you may have just dug your own grave for that
3564086 no soldier under my advisement will be treated as a sub human
3564087 hes trained seals who were responsible for turning the tide single handedly in armed conflict and has experience and knowledge far beyond any of ours of the hardships of combat
3564088 i hope youre willing to sacrifice your soldiers lives then
3564089 because at this rate theyll reach an early grave before they even set foot on any battlefield under his sadistic eye if they dont withdraw first
3564090 i understand your concern sgt harding i dont want to see any soldier leave any more than you do
3564091 you still have no fucking idea who youre dealin with do ya harding
3564092 youre barkin at the yard of a dog biggern you can possibly imagine
3564093 i think you will find the attached documents and files very interesting
3564094 howre your trained pussies progressing you teachin em to bake cookies an shit like that yet cuz the way you drill the fucks they aint gonna be men theyre comin out pansies
3564095 theyre learning about what it is that really makes a man
3564096 and im sure youd know all about it being a man with responsibilities what with all these checks youve been writing
3564097 i better just start hearing around the camp about how sergeant tyrant has suddenly turned over a new leaf and realized that stuffing soldiers faces in dog shit is an embarrassment to the country hes serving and decided to treat men like men and not mutts picked up off the street
3564098 come shoot with us well see what you got cmon dont be scared we wont bite unless you miss then well drill ya more than a korean hooker
3564099 cuz hes such an ace shot he can shoot the hairs off a ticks eyebrows
3564100 well okay billy the kid you now got a helluva rep to live up to so i dont think a regular shot will work here
3564101 holy shit hes gonna shoot it out of her mouth
3564102 oooh look at me arent i the spice a life
3564103 ah do declare you are jus the most purdiest thing ah ever did see
3564104 there there arent any bathrooms and stuff for girls im gonna have to use the same toilets sleep surrounded by boys and even have to
3564105 yeah i remember when i first got here and i had to do that
3564106 those guys ran off like scolded dogs just from seeing you there did you something that makes them scared of you now andrew laughed then went about telling patricia about his first month at the camp how ralph and his crew beat him and how he made a mortal enemy out of the freckled red headed ringleader and finally how he and z overthrew the tyrant leaving scars on the outside and inside of what was left of the thugs who lacked the spine they once had under ralphs reign now that he was gone too bad hes gone a lot of uses for a guy like that around here
3564107 z was so much stronger and bigger than me i could never beat him besides hed knock my head off if i tried something like that
3564108 yeah somewhere in the administrative building they got to keep files on all of us no doubt they have one on him too it would probably tell us more about him maybe tell us where he was taken to or something about his family
3564109 well just have to wait until night then sneak out of our quarters and break into the office
3564110 no i just how how do you even plan on getting in he used to break into places and steal stuff and he taught me how to pick a lock or two before i punched his lights out for making me take the fall for him once dont worry andy youre in good hands
3564111 guess he didnt do a very good job of that
3564112 how badly did he beat up people anyway was it so bad they had to just get rid of him
3564113 i dont know but somehow i think hes the reason they took z sounds like these guys are with the government they dont mess around ive kinda been looking into that myself i think itd be cool to do just like in the movies and they know all sorts of things about the government
3564114 all we have to do is get transferred to something better than this place an academy thatll get you a degree and maybe passage to a specialized school

3564124 its important to stand up when you hit the ground and you know i always stand up
3564125 it was his idea that instead of sitting here waiting for a major wind developer to come to us to instead take matters into our own hands
3564126 i didnt know anything about wind i was just a landowner farmer but it seemed intelligent
3564127 but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
3564128 some of the biggest tree huggers are against it i dont see why anyone would be against wind power
3564129 some people point blank dont like the looks of the turbine my wife and i love the look
3564130 farming or driving a truck are the only jobs around
3564131 at first the idea was hey this is going to be the largest land owner wind farm in the country until you know the facts its easy to dream big
3564132 we had a lot of negotiating power in the first proposal
3564133 we came up with a plan where everybody benefits regardless if you get a turbine or not

3564135 i used to be a long time pc user so my treo 750 had little problem syncing with all my stuff on my pc via activesync although not always a perfect world i was quite satisfied with the ease of syncing my treo with my pc a little over a year ago i switched from pc to a macbook pro at first i thought id have to use boot camp in order to boot up my mac in a windows environment so i could still sync my windows mobile treo but to my pleasant surprise a product was available that would allow my wm treo to peacefully co exist with my macbook the missing sync for windows mobile v4 0 2 from markspace com available here as a download for 39 95 or cd for 49 95 is a very capable way to allow your wm treo and apple computer to play in the same sandbox read on for my review
3564136 i found that some users complain about prices for iphone applications above 99 cents i regard it as art i did not expect many people to buy it and did not expect all the fuss about it
3564137 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now
3564138 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3564139 it is a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner they have conducted their day to day duties
3564140 i have sympathy for the problems of the third world but i dont believe violence and thievery are the answer
3564141 they wanted dollars but we only had a few quetzales with us on the boat
3564142 this case is a particularly tragic one when you look at the people involved
3564143 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3564144 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3564145 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3564146 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3564147 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3564148 this is pure intimidation of the press the public is entitled to know
3564149 they businessmen are becoming immune the regime helps them get out of disasters and whitewashes them
3564150 we should understand that russian channels are not just channels of an unfriendly state which are engaged in disinformation but they are tv channels of the state which declared war and is bombing our territories
3564151 we were filming in the city centre at the parliament building where refugees from south ossetia held their meeting we were cut short by some people who took away our camera and material the cameraman and the sound engineer were beaten up the men had camouflaged uniforms on and most likely represented some kind of law enforcement body we managed to get our camera back but not what we had filmed
3564152 hopefully this is only temporary the main internet provider in georgia blocked our access to the russian website we are not thinking about closing permanently because weve always had good co operation with our russian partners we try to provide balance and our readers dont understand whether were a georgian or a russian news agency because we present both sides objectively now our readers in russia are not getting a georgian perspective of what is happening
3564153 war a la carte how the u s invited a war in south ossetia
3564154 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
3564155 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
3564156 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
3564157 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
3564158 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3564159 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3564160 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
3564161 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
3564162 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there
3564163 gold platinum lead commodities into bear market on growth risk
3564164 were seeing a reconfiguration of the markets in the last 48 hours related to the realization that the slowdown in the u s has broadened across the globe
3564165 the dollar had an enormous spike in the past couple of weeks so the precious metals are losing their luster
3564166 i think its over in terms of the investment hypothesis at least for the next several years
3564167 i think the demand destruction both in the developed world and the developing world is going to be quite a bit greater than people assume
3564168 hedge funds are probably unwinding long positions in commodities and high yielding currencies and short positions in low yielding currencies
3564169 weve been surprised by the strength of the u s dollar rally over the past month
3564170 nevertheless we believe the threat of rising inflation and the climate of general economic uncertainty remains constructive for gold in the medium term
3564171 our campaign is preparing our legal action to fight for the thousands of arizona citizens whose voices were inappropriately stifled by the process this year based on the evidence of inaccurate counting we have seen we fully expect to be on the ballot in november
3564172 the time initiative campaign has several options to pursue to ensure we are on the ballot in november
3564173 the bottom line is that this process is still ongoing and it will be several days before all is said and done
3564174 people adore this blog for its snarky insightful commentary and reporting
3564175 were trying to energize who we have out there but a lot of young people arent going to vote
3564176 it seems like every couple of years they say its going to be the year of the youth vote and it hasnt been yet
3564177 id like to think people are more civilly engaged but its really that voter participation was so low that it had nowhere to go but up
3564178 with the magnitude of this presidential campaign im anticipating much more activity when school starts
3564179 truth is never fixed and neither is the writing process
3564180 the point of this classroom is that the liberated consciousness of students is the only educational objective worth considering
3564181 students own writing must be the center of the course
3564182 the real political truth about classrooms is that the teacher has all the power
3564183 hurt their feelings and scar them from feeling like they are good writers
3564184 as we assist and study individuals in pursuit of literacy we also recognize how literacy is in pursuit of them

3564301 we have every intention of reopening the museum once we get a plan in place
3564302 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3564303 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3564304 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3564305 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3564306 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3564307 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3564308 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3564309 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3564310 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3564311 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3564312 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3564313 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3564314 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3564315 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3564316 during the black hat conference last week a lot of vendors were talking about the importance of immediate detection and early disclosure and while this is critical it is only half the story
3564317 by developing an early disclosure policy microsoft is taking the necessary steps to protect its users now the vendor community needs to deliver on its responsibility of delivering the most effective protection possible sourcefire takes proactive protection extremely seriously and we will continue to focus on both the quality of our rules as well as the speed at which we address new threats
3564318 we are well positioned for growth in our core energy markets where our products enable a new level of energy efficiency for green building and automotive design
3564319 demand for improved energy efficiency in the automotive and window film markets is reflected in our second quarter results due to the seasonality of our business the second quarter is an important quarter and a significant contributor to our annual revenue and net income
3564320 southwall is committed to continued product innovation and channel expansion to meet an increasing global demand for energy efficiency in buildings and cars
3564321 the recent growth in sales highlights a growing consumer awareness of energy efficiency as a cost effective and readily available green technology choice that can have an immediate impact on saving energy and reducing carbon emissions
3564322 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl
3564323 we at talecris have long admired csl the opportunity for our employees customers distributors suppliers and most importantly our patients to benefit from being part of the csl family is exciting and is a testament to the quality and strength of talecris relationships with its stakeholders at the same time the transaction represents a good return for our shareholders many of whom are our employees
3564324 we believe talecris has demonstrated a track record of the utmost integrity and ethics and has some of the most widely used life enhancing plasma derived therapies available
3564325 patients count on talecris to provide them with the therapies they need we are committed to growing and enhancing the business to the benefit of all stakeholders
3564326 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3564327 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3564328 die entwicklung in georgien zeigt deutlich die verh ngnisvollen konsequenzen einer amerikanischen politik die seit l ngerem darauf ausgerichtet ist den eigenen einfluss in osteuropa und asien zu st rken auf russische befindlichkeiten keine r cksicht zu nehmen

3564332 windows server 2008 hyper v is an excellent option for corporations looking to save power and space ease provisioning efforts and achieve full hardware utilization through virtualization weve been an innovative early adopter worked closely with microsofts developers since the advent of windows nt and were pleased to do so as well with hyper v
3564333 after independent testing we found that diskeepers automatic defragmenter not only exploits windows server 2008 hyper v capabilities but also is designed to meet mission critical expectations in a virtualized environment
3564334 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3564335 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3564336 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3564337 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3564338 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3564339 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3564340 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3564341 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3564342 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3564343 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3564344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3564345 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3564346 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3564347 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3564348 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3564349 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3564350 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3564351 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3564352 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3564353 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3564354 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3564355 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3564356 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3564357 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3564358 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3564359 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3564360 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3564361 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3564362 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3564363 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3564364 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3564365 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3564366 pencairan batu bara merupakan upaya untuk meningkatkan nilai ekonomis batu bara rendah sehingga dapat dipasarkan secara komersial sebagai minyak sintetis
3564367 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3564368 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3564369 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3564370 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3564371 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3564372 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3564373 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3564374 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3564375 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3564376 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3564377 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3564378 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3564379 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3564380 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3564381 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3564382 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3564383 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3564384 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3564385 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3564386 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3564387 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3564388 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3564389 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3564390 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3564391 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3564392 who are open to doing something on the production side
3564393 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3564394 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3564395 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3564396 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3564397 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3564398 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3564399 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3564400 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3564401 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3564402 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3564403 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3564404 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3564405 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3564406 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3564407 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3564408 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3564409 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3564410 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3564411 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3564412 her career was over long before she had these troubles right now shed have to pay a studio to get herself into a movie
3564413 thrice obama voted to let doctors and nurses allow these tiny human beings die of neglect and be tossed out with the medical waste how can a man who purports to be a christian justify this if as its advocates contend abortion has to remain legal to protect the life and health mental and physical of the mother how is a mothers life or health in the least threatened by a baby no longer inside her but lying on a table or in a pan fighting for life and breath
3564414 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3564415 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3564416 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3564417 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3564418 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3564419 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3564420 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3564421 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3564422 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3564423 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3564424 there is like a hundred thousand people here just to see the hives hmm that seems good
3564425 i feel pretty good thats the most pitches ive thrown i felt like i was erratic these guys put some good swings on some good pitches and i also gave in to some counts where i was behind you cant pitch behind thats when guys are going to do their biggest damage they were battling i threw a lot of pitches to a lot of guys there were quite a few at bats that went deep four or five pitches i left some pitches over the plate obviously the results werent what id like but im coming out feeling good and something to build off which is what im really looking forward to
3564426 that was quite a few pitches in the first inning but i was just fighting myself a little bit id find it and then id try to find it and feel for it and it was just one of those starts where youve got to battle 80 pitches should get me a lot further than four and a third but i wasnt that sharp
3564427 ive been through injuries since the beginning of my career ive been through adversity so i learned at a young age that youve just got to keep working ive never stopped working or pushing to be the best or striving to have success i think eventually that turns into what you want and thats to have success yes ive had bad luck here and things happen here and an injury here but thats never really got me down yes its frustrating that you have to start from ground zero when you want to be out there helping your team i havent been able to do that thats the frustrating part
3564428 i felt like i had a pretty good life on the ball and some movement but its tough to tell ive had starts where i feel like i was working real hard and i thought the ball was coming out better than it was so i try not to judge it until i look at the chart but you cant put too much emphasis on that right now especially after having the surgery locations the biggest thing velocity is just a plus as your location gets better with better velocity the results sometimes come but i cant put too much bearing on that right now
3564429 but not everyone accepted this path today poland is ruled by a coalition of post solidarity revanchists post communist provincial trouble makers the heirs of pre second world war chauvinists xenophobic and anti semitic groups and the milieu of the spokesmen for ethno clerical fundamentalism

3564432 we first heard about the potential sale on a saturday and had the deal done by the wednesday so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying then the answer has to be no
3564433 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers that were done before i came so probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way it had also already taken up front payments from commercial deals and sponsorships which didnt help us at all

3564440 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories

3564442 we hope that people will help us in the future

3564448 ive seen it often enough where theyre very quick to charge people
3564449 thrice obama voted to let doctors and nurses allow these tiny human beings die of neglect and be tossed out with the medical waste how can a man who purports to be a christian justify this if as its advocates contend abortion has to remain legal to protect the life and health mental and physical of the mother how is a mothers life or health in the least threatened by a baby no longer inside her but lying on a table or in a pan fighting for life and breath
3564450 wow what happened to her she look so fat there
3564451 gosh what is this is it even a sin to be a little fat
3564452 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption
3564453 were still pretty early stages in this location stuff but if we can get wide adoption of fire eagle across the web we can become a leader
3564454 my heart is afraid that it will have to suffer
3564455 tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse that the suffering itself and that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream because every second of the search is a seconds encounter with god and with eternity

3564460 i guess you dont believe that a king would talk to someone like me a shepherd
3564461 not at all it was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge so its not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds
3564462 we show up even when were tired or grumpy or weve had the longest day its good company and you leave feeling really energized
3564463 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells

3564470 the role of the judge is one of umpire not ball player the judge serves to ensure that the rules of the game are being followed
3564471 we think were so good that when stuff doesnt go exactly our way its obviously the other persons fault
3564472 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3564473 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3564474 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
3564475 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

3564488 he said it looks like we are making wise decisions on how we are handling practice which for a young coach is reassuring because you are not always positive and it is nice to have that wisdom
3564489 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3564490 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3564491 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3564492 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3564493 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3564494 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3564495 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3564496 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3564497 korean athletes in beijing are providing great joy to their compatriots at home who have long been gloomy over the political strife and stagnant economy
3564498 ten and 10 which means 10 gold medals and a top 10 finish in the overall medals table was certainly a modest goal for the 260 strong korean contingent to beijing and the early performance allows the prediction of a better outcome
3564499 a young generation of korean athletes is conquering the world of swimming speed skating fencing and other sports once regarded as hopeless because koreans were shorter than their western competitors
3564500 hi counterfeminist here is the chance to let the unconstitutional
3564501 1 you might note that they should not assume what congress
3564502 2 you would hopefully stress that it was never proven nor should it be called a
3564503 i basically told them that their pamphlet will be ordered by the courts to be thrown in the garbage if they are not careful in their choice of words
3564504 i specifically told them that they should not reference the part of imbra that deals with the introduction stage because this has the highest chance of being overturned in the courts
3564505 i also noted that their jobs could be declared unconstitutional as the us constitution does not authorize congress to deal with domestic violence issues of any kind please comment yourself because we must have sufficient numbers doing this

3564512 the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly they are doing great damage to their ability to do that
3564513 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3564514 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3564515 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3564516 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3564517 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behaviour that looks like its from another time
3564518 they need to think about whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3564519 shanghai is the largest city in china in terms of population and one of the largest urban areas in the world with over 20 million people in its extended metropolitan area
3564520 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now
3564521 clearly russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g8 so they should be excluded and i think long term they must pay a price for this act which is clearly at the best you could call it a gross and outrageous over reaction to what might be viewed by some as provocation
3564522 thousands of innocent people are being rendered homeless killed and wounded and theres no necessity for it
3564523 i dont know if the president quote missed the boat but i do believe that the president probably had a higher opinion of vladimir putin than i do
3564524 through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia
3564525 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3564526 i think it depends on whether they think theyve achieved their objectives or not i think they want a regime change they want a compliant person in charge in tbilisi and i think they want control of the energy supply and i think its part of this also this effort to re exert age old russian influence in the region and that applies to azerbaijan to ukraine and either countries in the region who will i think they believe will take learn a lesson from this experience that georgias had

3564685 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3564686 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3564687 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3564688 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3564695 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3564696 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3564702 these new numbers for colorado validate other recent national polls and help underscore what we already know people nationwide including here in colorado support increasing our nations supplies of oil and natural gas
3564703 we have all along said yes drilling is a part of the solution but it has to be done right
3564704 industry would lead us to believe that a majority support unsafe drilling practices but those of us in the middle of gas patch experience impact after impact
3564705 we need to make sure that drilling is done in a safe responsible way or not at all in certain areas
3564706 colorado should help solve the energy crisis by increasing oil and gas production in whatever ways we can including opening up additional areas for drilling and reducing regulations and red tape in the drilling process

3564710 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3564711 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3564712 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3564713 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3564722 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats
3564723 at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3564724 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking

3564745 the white australian government has neglected them they need spiritual guidance and if christianity is not willing to treat them like human beings i know islam would society has marginalised these people
3564746 i disagree with his point in the sense that there is no place for the kind of violence that occurred there must be a better way for dealing with it and islam certainly doesnt condone that

3564776 we of this generation have become the willing unconscious or resentful victims of such a convulsion hence the air of futility that clings about us a feeling that man has lost faith in himself and in existence as a whole never before has man been left without guide or compass divorced from reality without religion
3564777 see the working out of an age long and deliberate scheme to destroy the church from within yet there is more proof of every kind for the existence of such a conspiracy than there is for some of the commonly accepted facts of history secret scheming hidden from the academic as from the public mind has been the background or driving force of much world history

3564789 the pyramid was one of the symbols that represented the unknown and nameless deity in pre christian cults centuries later it was resurrected as a symbol of the destruction of the catholic church and when the first phase of that destruction had been brought about by those who had infiltrated and since occupied some of the highest places in the church they reproduced it as a sign of their success

3564808 at the celebrations in honour of st francis of assisi in 1986 which stressed the unity of all the worlds religions the pope participated in a multi religious prayer for world peace traditionalists were horrified to see the pontif happily share a platform with a tibetan lama a hindu swami a native american medicine man a jewish rabbi and a maori high priest the unity of all the worlds religions and the recognition that they all derived from the same ancient source is the central philosophy of the secret societies

3564819 the peculiar strength of secret societies has always been their secrecy sometimes they had an affected occult significance that often led them to introduce absurd unpleasant rites of initiation there was one illuminati circle that persuaded candidates to enter a bath of water by pulling them towards the bath by means of a piece of string that was tied to their genitals it was this perverted sexual obsession that made some of weishaupts disciples undergo self castration

3564849 i think the revitalization for the downtown is needed weve gotten support from all the businesses around here and are really looking forward to downtown getting open
3564850 i hope they businesses flourish down here and they will its a new facility new businesses will come in town its great everybody likes something new
3564851 it was just critical that we were actually able to find a partnership here where the state the local government and now a private investor have come together to rebuild and create those jobs again its wonderful
3564852 selama semester i 2008 bursa kita selalu ditopang oleh sektor pertambangan dan perkebunan bukan oleh sektor sektor lainnya saat seperti sekarang kedua sektor itu anjlok tidak heran kalau ihsg mengalami terkoreksi cukup tajam
3564853 sebenarnya tidak ada sesuatu yang buruk yang terjadi pada fundamental perekonomian kita namun pasar sepertinya butuh momentum
3564854 no era la oportunidad fue una conversaci n sobre filosof a pero nada sobre temas de coyuntura
3564855 review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3564856 we have a serious humanitarian situation on our hands with high civilian casualties and tens of thousands of people displaced
3564857 this is the wrong time for american leaders to start injecting cold war bluster into the mix
3564858 the georgia conflict reflects two of the most dangerous dynamics of the last centurys geopolitics the cold war and a global addiction to oil lets hope the next president can create the blend of smart diplomacy and renewable energy that can avert lethal conflicts as we address the challenges of the 21st century
3564859 es decir que trascendi el p blico de la bailanta que es de un tama o limitado para llegar al amplio p blico variado de marcelo tinelli
3564860 we are pleased to announce that the 13th annual critical tits ride
3564861 that would be destroying the system the model that you operate on
3564862 its not like jim comes with an agenda we see each other all the time and maybe have lunch together once a week
3564863 carl liked to know more specifics said jerry bell president of twins sports inc
3564864 jim is the day to day person although its not day to day the way that carl was
3564865 the decision to trade santana was something we were all a part of
3564866 but after that how it happened when it happened what we would get in return and how we would negotiate that was the baseball staff with jim
3564867 its a family business and were all very close they let me run the film business the way i see fit but i always tell them what im doing and were always talking about various things we all have great mutual respect for each other
3564868 were all different i dont know that i have the great intuitive people knowledge that he did people like my dad are few and far between i dont think i have the same knack that he had but we work we learn
3564869 we very much want to grow and expand and have our generation have the same kind of success that my dad has had
3564870 spending more can help but there are plenty of examples that thats not the way to go
3564871 you have to remember that its not like theres a bottomless pit of people out there to spend money on
3564872 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3564873 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3564874 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3564875 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3564876 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3564877 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3564878 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3564879 it doesnt look very good they could be headed for bankruptcy
3564880 all of these companies have some hedges the problem is as with any contract they can gain in value or they can drop in value
3564881 with the decline in energy prices and assuming that sticks that clearly improves the inflation outlook relative to what i was earlier expecting
3564882 there is no business as usual in the connected era
3564883 boundaries for businesses are virtual this is a new class of worker who maybe doesnt have an office and who maybe visits 10 offices in a day and visits several different customers
3564884 the majority of people coming online and buying their first computer today are doing it in emerging countries like china india and brazil
3564885 if you look at india about 67 or more of their workforce is going to be entirely mobile and that is driving the demand for new features in the laptop like all day connectivity long battery life high level security and uncompromising design and durability
3564886 performance leaders and something the tech community will absolutely die for
3564887 with 17 000 notebooks being lost left unattended or reported missing at airports around the world many with important information on them our customers asked for the notion of a vault to secure their information
3564888 we have defined mobility for the business computer we are at that forefront of being different
3564889 i think what it comes down to is that for most of those customers highly mobile highly robust and highly secure systems are critical for large organisations ease of management and administration
3564890 i think what dell has done here is really very much focused on meeting the needs and wishes of this different class

3564896 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3564897 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3564898 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3564899 and then well cover your body in shredded beef and chicken slather you in barbeque sauce and drizzle melted cheese on your nipples wouldnt that be fucking hot
3564900 alright dont come any closer and why is there a fork in your hand
3564901 the clubs have both reached an agreement but there are also other teams interested apart from roma fenerbahce are one of those sides
3564902 well see what happens we will try and meet with the club in the next few days
3564903 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
3564904 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
3564905 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
3564906 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3564907 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3564908 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3564909 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3564910 my son asked me for a medal but he didnt ask for a particular one
3564911 after the olympics i will go back home quickly and make up for the love i have missed
3564912 there are a lot of middle aged women and men who have contacted me or stopped me in the street and they have told me that i am an inspiration to them
3564913 without the support of my family i would not have made a new challenge i stood on the tatami mat with the same feeling as one of the mothers out there
3564914 i didnt think my body would bounce back as fast as it has after giving birth and the strain of pregnancy so im excited now about seeing what can happen
3564915 i can kill someone and shouldnt give a damn rules dont apply to atheists especially ones that have god like origins

3564924 we would all love to beat yang wei but if he has a good competition i dont know that its possible it would be an incredible thing if it could happen
3564925 last year my mom and i love her to death said honey now you go out and have a great day
3564926 i said mom im going to be on the podium and i was just two tenths away and made a believer of her
3564927 this year she said you go out there and get that medal
3564928 i know he wants another medal in the all around or high bar event final so i want him to go for it
3564929 im proud of him already anything else is icing on the cake
3564930 horton likes being the underdog and being in front of all the people

3564932 probationer shall not go to any park playground school etc or any other place that is regularly frequented by minors under the age of sixteen
3564933 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3564934 yes this is a temporary solution but it is enough to cushion our operational costs for now
3564935 but we have questioned why there has not been a drastic decrease as price has to come down looking at the global price market even australia and new zealand have decreased their fuel prices by close to 15 cents
3564936 we welcome the decision the reduction on duty by government on diesel by 9 cent but this is not sufficient
3564937 we are aware of the 2 months lag and by now there should have been a reduction in fuel price
3564938 the dollars recovery remains vulnerable as its rise has been dependent on developments in external markets such as oil and stocks while there are still few reasons to buy the currency
3564939 market players are unsure how long the dollars rise will last against the euro and how much more oil and commodities prices will fall the dollar may quickly reverse its course and start falling as soon as oil and commodities prices resume their climb
3564940 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3564941 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3564942 these two patents enable users to click one button to contact another person and find that person no matter what device he or she is using or where he or she is
3564943 the patent and trademark office pto at our request thoroughly reviewed the prior art put forth by microsoft in their challenge of all 29 of avistars u s patents through the ptos re examination process earlier this year we feel that the ptos approval of these two patents together with their rejection of the re examination requests for 19 avistar patents and most of a 20th suggest a favorable outcome with regard to our other pending patents as well as the patents the pto has accepted for re examination
3564944 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3564945 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3564946 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3564947 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3564948 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
3564949 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
3564950 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
3564951 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
3564952 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
3564953 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
3564954 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
3564955 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
3564956 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
3564957 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
3564958 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
3564959 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3564960 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3564961 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
3564962 i know ive complained about your split ends before but hair thank you for being the only thing on this planet preventing me from
3564963 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3564964 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3564965 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3564966 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3564968 are you going to leave are you going to stay what are you going to do
3564969 that one is really hard we try to maintain as much privacy as we can and sometimes its just unavoidable they dont make it easy i dont know if i could take both kids out alone its really helpful to have dean or someone come out with me
3564970 its just amazing the best advice i ever listened to was when someone told me not to listen to anyones advice because its an individual experience and as a mom your instincts take over and thats the best thing
3564971 the best thing weve done with liam is talked to him we describe everything to him and we dont talk to him like hes a baby his vocabulary is amazing and he understands so much and hes so happy its important to communicate with your child now that weve seen that it works were doing the same thing with stella even though shes just two months
3564972 nos vamos a centrar en aumentar la calidad de los contenidos de wikipedia
3564973 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3564974 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3564975 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3564976 and your dad standing over there with his zipper open is that disgracing
3564977 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3564978 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3564979 those are rumors right now and we cant comment on any of those rumors
3564980 el secuestro de no villegas trejo pastor y empresario se realiz el 23 de julio y fue ayer lunes cuando los agentes de la polic a ministerial del estado pme descubrieron el cad ver enterrado en el patio trasero de la vivienda
3564981 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
3564982 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
3564983 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3564984 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3564985 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3564986 to respect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
3564987 there is a reinforcement on the other side and its not by chance that we are training intensively on the golan heights and on a major scale
3564988 i say for a thousandth time that we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
3564989 we are against the israeli regime we have no war with jews

3565001 prices in states like california and oregon have taken a freefall and we dont know why idahos market should be any different

3565003 its about who we are as people and our personal lives things weve gone through in the past 12 months

3565011 congressman dent is so deep in the pocket of big oil companies and special interest groups hes refusing to publicly defend his record and have an open debate about the issue
3565012 he should explain why hes taken 75 000 from big oil and given them billions in tax breaks while middle class pennsylvanians are struggling to afford high gas prices voters deserve an open dialogue on the issues and congressman dent is ducking the issue
3565013 we are disappointed that tom latham refused to debate becky greenwald at the iowa farmers union convention we tried to work with his schedule and find a venue for a debate at an event latham would already be attending
3565014 iowans deserve to hear from tom latham why after 14 years in congress he has done nothing to address the energy crisis lack of care for our veterans and the high cost of healthcare
3565015 we just want to give our working families a chance to talk to the candidates said union president fred frost who met late wednesday with representatives from two of the republican campaigns in a bid to revive the events

3565038 since thai troops entered the temple there have been fewer foreign tourists but the number of locals visiting has doubled

3565040 if i wrote a history book people would be less interested so i changed it into an historical novel that details the genesis of the lawsuit until success at the hague in june 1962
3565041 i didnt want to change history i didnt want myself by writing the book to trouble history and i didnt want readers to be angry with other nations after reading it
3565042 i just want readers to learn something and love our ancient culture
3565043 i want all cambodians and the younger generation to know in more detail about the preah vihear lawsuit and what went on during that time
3565044 more hotels will mean tougher competition but in a free market competition will help improve services and bring more competitive prices
3565045 the 16 storey sokha phnom penh hotel will be built on six hectares of land which is under a 99 year land lease from city hall from 2007
3565046 there is a problem with traffic because there is only one bridge for access
3565047 the hotels conference centre will seat up to 1 500 people and will be the countrys biggest conference hall it will raise cambodias reputation internationally
3565048 the sokha phnom penh hotel will be the hotel with the largest conference hall in the city and it will be suitable for international conferences
3565049 foreign tourism has grown 19 percent year on year so the hotel will satisfy high class guests
3565050 it is a good sign for the tourism sector it shows that the tourism industry is getting better and better
3565051 the hotel will be good for high class guests and it will be as high quality as those in neighbouring countries

3565054 overall 31 of physicians were fully engaged or engaged while the largest proportion of physicians 53 were on the fence
3565055 sales representatives must develop personal relationships with their physicians to achieve the highest levels of engagement
3565056 in fact emotional components such as friendship with the reps are the strongest indicators of fully engaged physicians we find that this emotional dimension is key in understanding physicians perceptions toward their reps and the pharmaceutical company as a whole
3565057 merritts plan looks great on paper and essentially costs nothing for microsoft to try
3565058 for 25 million per year or about the cost of of 1 1800th of a yahoo microsoft could push a few hundred smart kids through this program
3565059 it would be good for microsoft if they were able to engage startups more one way to do it would be by investing in them i dont think they could or should do it in the same format as y combinator though its too messy this early if they were going to invest in startups they should do it in the next stage
3565060 at ycs stage investing is a lot more involved than just supplying money and a big company wouldnt be good at the kind of things you have to do plus the failure rate is very high
3565061 the culture of a y combinator would be virtually impossible to replicate by any big company and even if it were theoretically feasible the people like graham who would be needed to run such an incubator would either never sign up to do so or if they did they wouldnt last long

3565068 he felt better and decided to do a few things

3565071 i should know by this time that just because i feel that everything is useless and going to pieces and badly done and futile it is not really that way at all everything is all right it is in the hands of god let us abandon everything to divine providence
3565072 during the summer when things were going especially hard in more ways than one i grimly modified grace before meals we give thee thanks o lord for these thy gifts and for all our tribulations from thy bounty through christ our lord amen one could know of certain knowledge that tribulations were matters of thanksgiving that we were indeed privileged to share in the sufferings of our lord
3565073 its just one of those things you feel like doing sometime and getting together with patrick duffy and linda gray
3565074 getting back to dallas im looking forward to that i love that town i get back two or three times a year weve got a lot of fans coming from i think all over the place
3565075 patrick and linda and i get together once a month and have lunch or dinner
3565076 it was a fun show and it was different in that there were a lot of bad characters at the beginning playing a bad guy is more fun than playing a good guy poor old patrick duffy had to play the good guy thats a hard role then theres the women and money and stuff we were in kind of a recession then and people couldnt afford to go out and get a baby sitter and go to the movies and have dinner the show came along and it was something to do on a friday night
3565077 i havent got the foggiest idea how many families do you know of who are all multimillionaires living in the same house with one bedroom and one bathroom i mean come on but that resonates around the world in many many countries the grandparents live with the children and grandchildren they have more insular families and i think people relate to that
3565078 i feel great my health is good my liver is doing well
3565079 many energy managers find themselves drowning in the volume of data generated
3565080 when you have to play champions league qualifiers so early you push players and they get injuries which is what has happened
3565081 sometimes you wish that no one wanted anything from you

3565089 it was a big risk we knew this but if audi couldnt have managed this pioneering achievement who could have

3565091 tra la professoressa e gli allievi esistono invalicabili limitazioni di comunicabilit tale fatto che rende agli allievi difficile lapprendimento delle materie di insegnamento e praticamente impossibile la comprensione delle lingue classiche porr i sottoscritti genitori in dovere di chiedere il nulla osta per iscriverli ad altro istituto gi dallinizio del prossimo anno scolastico
3565092 finora la professoressa in questione ha svolto bene il proprio compito prendo atto delle richieste dei genitori inoltrate a me solo poche settimane fa ma non posso fare altro che rimettere ogni atto agli organi superiori competenti infatti non spetta a me stabilire se un docente in grado di svolgere correttamente la propria attivit oppure no
3565093 purtroppo innanzi al perdurare di una situazione di disinteresse generale che penalizza gli alunni

3565100 youre really like youre mom youre right youre just like mary and shes going to love you she wont be let down she is probably so excited to see you after all these years she wont care what you look talk act like i guarantee it your mom was the most important person in her life and she had always dreamed of being an old lady still spending the afternoons with your mom and you girls referring to lanna and i being close its a shame that you werent for all these years but i am really happy you found each other and will spend time together i know mary is too and i know your mother would be thrilled thrilled you dont even know
3565101 but it was so long ago we have to move on from it how long can you blame the past
3565102 i have never heard anybody talk so much in my life
3565103 i hope you will well have so much fun oh please call please call promise me
3565104 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
3565105 what they plan to do is to use a frame to tie the pillar together as a remedy to stop it from further falling apart
3565106 once this is done they will conduct further inspections to find out what actually went wrong
3565107 rappezzato alla belle meglio con le solite pezze per fare una bella figura ma permettendo al contempo di far ricardere sempre la colpa su questo o quello a seconda degli sviluppi
3565108 we have taken statements from the teacher and students who lodged police reports but referred the matter to the education department for further action
3565109 this is only a strategy to allow ranariddh to return to the country
3565110 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3565111 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3565112 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3565113 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3565114 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3565115 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3565116 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3565117 there was lip syncing in the olympics opening ceremony the fireworks were made by a computer and sports are a dispute over the best doping id rather read a book
3565118 that would be destroying the system the model that you operate on
3565119 its not like jim comes with an agenda we see each other all the time and maybe have lunch together once a week
3565120 carl liked to know more specifics said jerry bell president of twins sports inc
3565121 jim is the day to day person although its not day to day the way that carl was
3565122 the decision to trade santana was something we were all a part of
3565123 but after that how it happened when it happened what we would get in return and how we would negotiate that was the baseball staff with jim
3565124 its a family business and were all very close they let me run the film business the way i see fit but i always tell them what im doing and were always talking about various things we all have great mutual respect for each other
3565125 were all different i dont know that i have the great intuitive people knowledge that he did people like my dad are few and far between i dont think i have the same knack that he had but we work we learn
3565126 we very much want to grow and expand and have our generation have the same kind of success that my dad has had
3565127 spending more can help but there are plenty of examples that thats not the way to go
3565128 you have to remember that its not like theres a bottomless pit of people out there to spend money on
3565129 the thai troops are guarding a gate to the temple and cambodian soldiers are standing just outside the gate
3565130 its one of those things where what do you really do
3565131 i feel like im helping the team a lot in the seventh inning and doing a good job
3565132 but if i could help the team starting and thats what we need more then thats what i want to do
3565133 i hope but the way players are going right now you never know
3565134 we might have to call his agent to see if hes available to start
3565135 thats the way baseballs going right now all the political garbage hes definitely in the mix
3565136 if im more valuable in the bullpen then so be it
3565137 for audi safety and performance have always gone hand in hand our cars are engineered to offer the best not just in crash protection but in preventing traffic accidents altogether
3565138 with the launch of the audi q7 tdi clean diesel in 2009 american suv buyers will have even more options from which to choose for safety as well as fuel economy convenience and performance
3565139 almost all of the attacks are broadly and globally sourced one attack appears to be very narrowly focused possibly someone with some basic ping flood scripts
3565140 i cant go and talk to these people so i have to infer what their intent was
3565141 what weve done is built away of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern

3565143 investing in prevention and early intervention for older children and adolescents can make a huge difference in a young persons life their families and the communities they live in
3565144 this is so longer term strategies can be put in place to support young people who are drifting away from the education system
3565145 what i was really impressed with today was how dedicated and committed the staff are to their clients and the community they work in
3565146 weve had really successful visits and tours to katoomba high school for our year six students
3565147 this means significant additional support for tenants in the area because until now a tenancy outreach service was provided for just one day per month
3565148 vodafone didnt notify the chamber when they claimed and we had a very short time to send a submission but we expressed strong opposition to the tower going in the centre of the village
3565149 they vodafone are not concerned about peoples opinions or objections all they want to do is get the tower up there
3565150 they say there is no health worries yet they cant put it a tower near the local schools so that says something
3565151 and whose to say there wont be health problems in 15 years time they cant guarantee that wont happen
3565152 after much consideration and deliberation vodafone has decided to proceed to meet demand for mobile network services in the area
3565153 the decision to proceed follows an extenstive consultation process far exceeding the minimum requirements of the acif industry code
3565154 vodafone considers the siting solution in station street strikes an appropriate balance between providing reliable mobile network coverage in wentworth falls whilst minimising the visual impact through selection of the least visually intrusive location
3565155 vodafone was hoping for a more constructive process of dialogue with the chamber
3565156 whats been proposed is an insult to this group and the community
3565157 council appears to be neglecting the principles of participatory democracy
3565158 since the adoption of the upper kedumba valley plan of management in 2004 council has not consulted with us
3565159 i know the bushcare people were premeditatedly and intentionally separated from this process
3565160 it is important for the gullys traditional owners to be part of decision making
3565161 ive been to the consultation meetings and read the reports and im pleased at what council is doing
3565162 its an aboriginal place and aboriginal people need to be the main consultation group
3565163 the cultural connection with the place is old and it is strong
3565164 it could be the first time that this happening in nsw possibly in australia
3565165 this the gully is blackfellas land and it should remain so
3565166 i know how important this is to them former residents of the gully
3565167 it will establish an interpretive walk about the gully aboriginal people implement a cross cultural training program between council and the local aboriginal community and restore bushland areas within the gully
3565168 but im most concerned about it being used as a tool for organised crime
3565169 i might be being alarmist but i think people have a right to know if their house is going to be photographed for all to see
3565170 future generations will never have the freedom we had and i think people have to start saying something
3565171 its also a potential service for burglars what if you left your garage door open when the google car came along
3565172 then anyone on the internet would be able to see what you have
3565173 many people would not even be aware that their homes can be viewed on the internet
3565174 people need to know how to remove photos but what about those who dont have internet access
3565175 ive had some fun with it spotting some of my friends places
3565176 you can see where you want to go before you even go there
3565177 we have an independent pest controller inspect the kitchen every three months that changes the rat poison baits thats how you keep them pests at bay
3565178 weve been in business here for 16 years and weve never had a problem with rats
3565179 she wanted a plastic one but our pest controller told us we needed a metal strip
3565180 we installed it but it took some time to order
3565181 weve paid the fine and didnt do the things required within the given timeframe but let the punishment be in accordance with the crime
3565182 unlike a parking ticket where you can write a letter explaining important circumstances there is no recourse with this penalty notice outside of going to court
3565183 there is no indication on the list that this is our first offence in 16 years of being in business
3565184 we wanted the inspector to talk to us can she prove there were any droppings
3565185 there is an element of a witch hunt going on
3565186 they always look at filters and underneath stoves but then the degree of what else they look at varies enormously
3565187 we know they missed a former restaurant near us three times in a row while they inspected our kitchen twice
3565188 innovation solar energy increasing petrol prices these are the hot topics of climate change
3565189 the sunswift solar car provides an answer to all these issues and represents the necessary future of transport technology
3565190 we always use the analogy a formula one car its built as a race car not as an everyday car you will never see a car like this on the road its just not practical
3565191 if its within the law with peoples lives at stake and millions and millions of dollars at stake people will do whatever it takes to win a case
3565192 the stakes are getting higher and higher and its becoming increasingly difficult to persuade jurors that have strong biases so we need information ahead of time everything is fair game
3565193 you get a picture of the juror thats almost always different
3565194 i totally understand how innocent people that go to prison turn into hardened criminals
3565195 youd hate to leave erin on your jury without having seen her writing
3565196 a jurors blog tells you things about the jurors that she probably wont tell you herself
3565197 if we hadnt had this amazing resource we wouldnt have found that the internet is an amazing tool for lawyers
3565198 you get lists with dozens even hundreds of names on it
3565199 you dont want to tip off jurors so that they know youve been investigating them
3565200 and you dont want to pander to them that can be dicey and potentially dangerous although im sure a skilled trial lawyer could find a way to weave information into his words
3565201 the next time we get a case you can bet ill have an associate sitting there with a laptop plugging in names
3565202 you are taking people who are doing their civic duty and didnt sign up to have their whole life probed
3565203 it scares people they wonder are they going to hack into our e mails next the internet in so many areas creates an extraordinary conflict between the desire for information and the desire for privacy
3565204 the juror might then go to the other jurors and say you know what that lawyer did he investigated me
3565205 they may think youre invading their privacy and think ill of you
3565206 i havent seen any abuse such as a lawyer discovering a juror loves eating at christinas mexican restaurant and then making sure food is brought in during jury deliberations from christinas mexican restaurant
3565207 we keep thinking we will catch up but each week is a crescendo from the week before
3565208 with the cost of fuel in the east going up they are doing a pretty good job of taking availability of some of our products
3565209 the orders coming first and fastest are from the east and that has our attention
3565210 im getting calls from all over the country from investors who gave their money to vesta
3565211 were going to coordinate our efforts as appropriate with other agencies
3565212 underlying property fundamentals are demonstrating less stability than in the past which may lead to more volatile returns
3565213 the current markets have provided our investors with a unique opportunity to take advantage of softening prices
3565214 i dont believe there is anybody at buchanan ingersoll who has any potential of moving who doesnt have his r sum out there
3565215 it was a terrible four months for the profession and were still ahead on a bottom line basis
3565216 given the kind of year it is we look at the internal numbers as very positive
3565217 personally i was puzzled by the firms decision to make its next big move to expand within pennsylvania through the klett rooney merger
3565218 its a perfectly valid move to add strength to strength but it struck me as something that was in a different direction than becoming known as a national player
3565219 there was a tremendous amount of jealousy and rivalry that existed between pittsburgh and the branch offices with the guys in pittsburgh believing the branch offices were taking out too much money
3565220 that told me volumes about what they thought of the prospects of that office
3565221 would we be interested in a merger of equals or a merger with a substantial larger firm certainly wed be interested in that
3565222 at the same time im not going to put myself in the
3565223 youve got to produce and weve become more and more demanding
3565224 perhaps this wasnt the optimal forum for a number of people
3565225 kerry feels hes ready to close again and you know what he probably is i think we give him one more tightener and then we get him back in the closers role
3565226 the amazing thing is in the 30 games or so that woods been out or hasnt closed there havent been many closing opportunities
3565227 they kind of mentioned it to me a dont really make any plans type of deal which i already knew was coming
3565228 theres a lot more movement and footwork besides the longer throw and deeper angles
3565229 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field
3565230 hes just in a little bit of a slump hes probably trying to do too much and he needs to do the things hes capable of like he was doing early in the year hes taking less pitches not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes i really respect him and really like him as a player
3565231 if youre confident everything will be fine everybody has bad moments i think he understands
3565232 this is his first year in the united states but he has played a lot of years in japan he cant think about trying to do too much its not easy for him first year in the united states he doesnt have friends its a different country theres a lot of things in his head and he never played in as many games here like he did in japan
3565233 if he hits fastballs and the scouts see it theyll throw more breaking balls
3565234 thats what its all about being confident and making adjustments i want to talk to him and say dont lose your confidence and come back every day like its a new day every day is different he can play bad yesterday or today but tomorrow is another day
3565235 thats the word sometimes you have to be patient wait for your opportunity we have a lot of good outfielders here i knew i had to be patient when i wasnt getting to play much
3565236 juan certainly is looking for an opportunity to reestablish himself after missing the lions share of last year
3565237 we had him on the playoff roster so we knew what he could do we had some conversations with juan in the spring he understood he didnt have a lot of options for a player in his situation
3565238 we know hes a valuable piece of our team and hopefully in the future nobody worked harder than juan he was there for every extra hitting session he kept himself in shape he worked out at first base in the spring a little bit and still works out at first in case theres a need
3565239 reggie willits is in the same boat our bench has guys who could have more playing time in other places we have a lot of confidence in what juan can do and hes responded very well
3565240 i was going to but i recognized that he wasnt going to give it to me
3565241 baseball is a crazy game who knows how to explain it
3565242 i just try to come here every day and do what i have to do to get better and try to have fun
3565243 ive known a few of them playing against them i just wanted to come in and meet the guys and not make ripples in the water come in under the radar and try to fit in
3565244 they dont feel like they have to be the guy and try to do something theyre not capable of doing
3565245 we were in it a couple of years ago with the wild card but we faded out
3565246 its what you play for this is why you play the game after the trade deadline i didnt think i was going to get this opportunity its something that doesnt happen for everybody so im going to enjoy it
3565247 so id take some grounders and then head to left
3565248 i shouldnt automatically assume that im in the lineup every single day
3565249 i know he wants to rest me and its been working out fine all year im having a pretty good year and hes been able to protect me and rest me and make sure i stay healthy last night was just one of those days where unfortunately i had to find out from reporters instead of looking at the lineup
3565250 i think damon can play on a regular basis for us
3565251 i am not concerned i think hes healthy enough now to play for us on a regular basis as long as he keeps from running into walls with his left shoulder
3565252 we feel that johnny is healthy enough to play center field for us
3565253 you run a little bit more maybe but every position is demanding were going to try to put our best lineup on the field every day well look at it every day for johnny i think playing center field is like riding a bike i dont think its a tough adjustment
3565254 as a player you would like that but the manager is the one that calls the shots
3565255 maybe he didnt think about it until he got to the ballpark he normally lets me know as players you know there might be some guys that came here today not knowing if they were playing or not its part of the game
3565256 you know you watch him do his work and the work is good
3565257 you watch his preparation and at times hes a little overanxious at times hes run into some bad luck its been a tough couple of months for melky the bottom line is i think hes better than what hes produced i really do we all believe that for whatever reason its a tough year for him
3565258 we are extremely pleased with the progress and pace of the construction of our new complex thus far
3565259 once complete it will be recognized as one of the best major league complexes in the dominican and should give us a significant advantage in our efforts in the region in fact the plans for the new complex and the increase in the latin american operations budget has already started to pay dividends with the prospects we have signed over the past month
3565260 finding and developing talent in latin america is a top priority for our ballclub
3565261 this complex demonstrates our long term commitment to having strong operations in the dominican republic and throughout latin america
3565262 weve told dontrelle the same thing my goal with him and our goal with him has been that wed like him to be ready to be the big league pitcher that hes capable of being in 2009
3565263 if its before that thats great so lets see what happens
3565264 he threw strikes the last time out and the previous few times out hes averaged around 90 mph hes topped out higher than that his arm strength is there his breaking balls been solid well just wait and well take it turn by turn
3565265 hes worked very hard in all aspects conditioning and delivery wise
3565266 hes been great with the kids down there the other thing thats happened with him is that he really has had a great sense of focus when hes gotten on the mound which hes worked on much more serious out there for him just little things that instructors have tried to make adjustments with him that so far hes taken to them
3565267 hes obviously thrown pretty well but i think this next step is critical because reporters will be down in toledo watching him to their credit im sure therell be some cameras down there from detroit its another step we have to just wait and see how its handled
3565268 its another step in the right direction and well have to see how this step goes from what im hearing hes made some real good strides obviously thats true or they wouldnt be sending him to triple a
3565269 we think this is the way were trying to address it before it becomes more problematic
3565270 i think he got to the point where he felt this was inhibiting him from going on his scheduled start
3565271 nobody wants to pitch that game thursday more than him for all the right reasons
3565272 aproveche los cuatro a os que le quedan de mandato y se ponga a gobernar nunca nadie ha estado tanto tiempo en el poder c mplele al pueblo que tanto te quiso y crey en ti ch vez desde el zulia te lo pido ponte a gobernar a este pa s

3565280 these were the vietnamese soldiers the khmer rouge captured during border clashes
3565281 were halfway through this journey of design its been a buzz
3565282 i love the fact that without exception everyone i talk to has been really positive i think people can see were genuine and we are i really want to do it right
3565283 i imagine it will mainly be used as holiday homes ive had approaches from golf club members who want to live there as well
3565284 its just a beautiful place to be its peaceful and its got a really positive energy about it
3565285 i believe with the interest weve got we can do it in one stage over 12 to 24 months
3565286 this allows us to improve our course to such an extent that we can become a top course
3565287 we need to make it attractive for him because his guests will swell our coffers if we get 10 green fee players per week thats 15 000 a year for us and thats equivalent to 20 new members
3565288 its a significant thing in terms of nelson its the first in new zealand and the vanguard of whats going on in the world
3565289 we know how obama operates weve seen it in chicago for years and were not taking any chances
3565290 my favorite thing to do as a young boy was to play the ronettes

3565294 the problem is the truth is still not being told
3565295 cardinal pell is being deceitful dishonest and protecting the church and this is nothing but window dressing because they have come under so much pressure over this
3565296 unless hes prepared to do that to sit down and hear me and discuss the facts and debate the detail then theres no point in meeting

3565325 any oil a consumer picks up from the grocery shelf and uses to cook with is probably healthier than foods prepared for them by a commercial industry
3565326 even cooking a relatively unhealthy side dish for example french fries using farm grown potatoes and cooking oil is likely to be healthier than picking up frozen french fries in the grocery store thats because frozen french fries are often pre cooked in partially hydrogenated oil
3565327 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there
3565328 my own research says the way a man smells to a woman is the main determinant of sexual attraction
3565329 if you cant stand how someone smells you cannot become intimate
3565330 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
3565331 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell
3565332 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies

3565346 ive pretty much given up on this stuff for one thing its really difficult to keep up with using it every single time you blow your nose as recommended in the directions and despite using it a lot and having it do what its supposed to do create a gel like lining in your nasal tract it has proved no match for the allergens i breathe

3565348 prospects of improved oil market fundamentals over the next 18 months point to an easing in the market balance and price weakness over the near term
3565349 the concern is that winter fuels bills could have as big or a bigger impact
3565350 raises the prospect for a drop in demand for opec crude oil and an increase in surplus capacity
3565351 downward price pressures would increase if the economic slowdown proves deeper or longer than expected and if higher prices lead to lower consumption and lower demand for opec crude than currently anticipated
3565352 the result was probably a tad below expectations thereare probably going to be slight downgrades in the market
3565353 at present we are seeing minimal impact from theprevailing macroeconomic environment on our domestic business
3565354 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3565355 cvs has always wanted to be in good markets that grow and if you look at population centers of the united states were in most of them this directly addresses the central and northern california markets and gives us access to those consumers
3565356 these are highly attractive regions of the country where we are not currently represented
3565357 and they are very difficult real estate markets to penetrate
3565358 given our changing industry landscape we believe this combination is the logical step for our company
3565359 not compatible with the welfare of society at large and that it
3565360 we need legal details un security council resolutions and we need more presence on the ground of international observers
3565361 today georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3565362 a black bear repeatedly mauled an 8 year old boy monday evening near a popular motor trail on the outskirts of gatlinburg and an animal matching its description was later killed by park rangers
3565363 parks were designed so people could experience nature in a positive way not be eaten by it
3565364 i was reasonably encouraged by what i saw at the limited number of sites
3565365 this does not mean that there is not still looting going on
3565366 almost impossible to overstate for the destruction of history that has taken place
3565367 must have yielded tablets coins cylinder seals statues terra cotta bronzes and other objects in the hundreds of thousands
3565368 weve seen cases of looted objects turning up for sale decades later
3565369 the customs announcements are helpful but the key thing is keeping law enforcement interested in protecting antiquities
3565370 were sorry the memo found its way into the inbox of every major media outlet in the america it was a mistake we promise all of our clients strict anonymity
3565371 it was just a coincidence we had our press room ready for all you
3565372 this search was definitely a challenge we needed to find someone to literally be the st peter to baracks messiah image avoiding a ringo starr was a paramount concern to us seriously that guy shouldnt be allowed to call himself a beetle

3565376 does the objective correlation of forces favour those leaders who in a pre modern way have a clear sense of what they want and are ready to take risks to achieve it will think they have the upper hand against leaders who rely on little more than post modern flannel and uneasy hopes
3565377 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3565378 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3565379 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3565380 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3565381 the bonfire itself acted not as a celebration of culture or history but as a nationalist statement to the fact that can do what they like in a divided community
3565382 the same anti internment bonfires were also erected in antrim and belfast to the dismay of sinn fein who vocally condemned them and the people who built them
3565383 obviously against his partys policy cllr billy leonard has given his support and helped to create a republican ghetto within the heights area by trying to support these people who are constantly intent on violence
3565384 the protestant community are very upset with firstly billy leonard who fails to condemn the actions of these thugs and secondly the psni who seem afraid to take action against the thugs who create such violence within the heights area on a daily basis
3565385 people who witnessed the act were absolutely amazed that someone like torrens knight could be given this role it puts the apprentice boys in a very precarious position when they entrust the laying of a wreath to an icon of loyalist murder gangs who colluded with the security forces
3565386 people in greysteel kilrea and other parts of co derry who lost relatives because of that infamous uff group will be disgusted that the so called progressive minded apprentice boys are associated with knight and integrate him in such a central way at one of their parades
3565387 the organisation would really need to look hard at future arrangements if they are to help move things forward in the kilrea area
3565388 the kilrea branch of the walkers club have never had and do not have any loyalist terrorists in their ranks
3565389 on saturday morning as is our tradition we laid a wreath at the cenotaph in kilrea in memory of our brethren who died in the wars the wreath was laid by our branch president mervyn moore our president for the past five years
3565390 the apprentice boys have been demonised sinn f in in the past but on this occasion we are demanding answers we will be demanding an apology and an explanation for this extraordinary claim from the deputy first minister and sinn f in
3565391 due to the risks assumed by the city and its contractors working without commercial insurance coverage

3565402 last night coleraine saw some of the worst incidents in recent years and unionism loyalism and the police must finally come to terms with their street and community arrogance in this town
3565403 a nationalist lady was struck twice by police in the most thuggish way as she helped an injured relative nationalists had to jump walls and seek the safety of houses the houses were then attacked
3565404 loyalists were obviously out to maximise injuries and convey their small town arrogance and yet again the police colluded with them
3565405 these two men have issued many statements deriding the nationalist and republican community where these incidents happened yet they equivocate on loyalist guns and loyalist thuggery
3565406 anyone not happy with police action should contact the office of the police ombudsman

3565413 recreate the number of views for any particular day of a video
3565414 would be expensive and time consuming particularly in light of the need to examine the contents for privileged and work product material
3565415 there is no need to engage in a detailed privilege review of the logging database since it simply records the numbers of views for each video uploaded to the youtube website and the videos watched by each user
3565416 plaintiffs would likely be able to determine the viewing and video uploading habits of youtubes users based on the users login id and the users ip address
3565417 login id is an anonymous pseudonym that users create for themselves when they sign up with youtube
3565418 subpoena is troubling because it permits the government to peek into the reading habits of specific individuals without their prior knowledge or permission
3565419 its hard to pinpoint exactly what has gotten everybody so concerned
3565420 no one is alleging that the company did anything deliberate
3565421 but it hurts confidence to see an error that is of this magnitude
3565422 we look forward to the company providing answers to accounting questions at its august 28 2008 analyst meeting in baltimore
3565423 im scratching my head a little bit at the magnitude
3565424 its almost as if overnight people have come to the realization that this company is involved in dynamic volatile financial and energy markets and theyre shocked by the fact
3565425 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3565426 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3565427 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3565428 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3565429 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people

3565442 just one our sales people average 20 to 30 customers a day how much was the sale for
3565443 101 237 65 what the heck did you sell him
3565444 first i sold him a small fish hook then i sold him a medium fishhook then i sold him a larger fishhook then i sold him a new fishing rod then i asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast so i told him he was going to need a boat so we went down to the boat department and i sold him a twin engine chris craft then he said he didnt think his honda civic would pull it so i took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 expedition
3565445 a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a truck is that right
3565446 no the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife
3565447 he came in with a stiff neck i had him in the lineup originally but he came in sore he said he could get loose but i went back a little later and he was still fighting it
3565448 hes the guy who makes us go people pitch around him and when theyve made mistakes hes made them pay
3565449 i think were starting to see the guy we signed finally healthy or almost healthy the arm strengths not totally there but were getting a little bit of what we hoped from the beginning until all the shoulder injuries came

3565453 the last few days four or five days weve seen one of the most unexpected crises in the world as the russians moved into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be
3565454 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3565455 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3565456 you got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to senator obama cause he is a gifted young man but he is not ready to be president on june sic 20th 2009
3565457 this man mccain is ready to be commander in chief on day one tested in war and peace he has passed both tests with honor that shows not only his ability but his character
3565458 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3565459 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3565460 poor guys who broke into his house to rob and found out he was home
3565461 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3565462 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat
3565463 its clear that state attorneys general are not doing a whole lot about internet consumer protection
3565464 they havent made it a priority in the states that have made it a priority theyve been able to win settlements
3565465 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3565466 he was probably eight feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3565467 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3565468 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3565469 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3565470 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3565471 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3565472 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3565473 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3565474 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think

3565498 the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose in the present moment and non judgmentally to things as they are

3565507 why do you think people are so fixated on celebrities
3565508 i think its an illusion especially young people who are looking for their own identities they see what they think these celebrities have and they want it for themselves and it may or may not be what it seems everybody wants a hero i do think we place some people on a pedestal and sometimes that creates too much pressure on them and they cant stay there
3565509 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells

3565516 i felt like the land the forests the skies were clearing me of this debris i no longer needed it was a very spiritual time for me
3565517 there are situations in your life that are so tiring so exhausting but when you get to the top of the hill you find that there are reasons for it
3565518 so that has made me much more anxious than i already am the conversations with my significant other have become more tense and emotional i think about money quite a bit but am afraid to discuss it because i know he and i have very different opinions
3565519 weve decided to put our credit cards away my husband is working 12 hour shifts and all the overtime he can get so we dont have much time to sit and discuss finances we agree to limit spending by shopping at resale stores as much as we can
3565520 nearly half of busted halo respondents said that the current state of the economy has made money discussions with their spouse or significant other more tense and more than 40 said talking about finances makes them emotional
3565521 my boyfriend and i have totally different perspectives on money
3565522 he thinks that it should be used to enjoy life and to invest to make more money i think that it should be spent on all needs and some wants and the rest should be saved for a rainy day i learned that not everyone needs money in the bank to feel secure but i sure do
3565523 sometimes feels that i am nonchalant about spending the money that he works hard for this is a misinterpretation but i cant always make him see that at the time

3565525 its a steamhorse deluxe its a carriage horseless car for short a beaut itll take us where youre going right fast
3565526 the acquisition will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics marketplace
3565527 by far the best opening of all time for a romantic comedy
3565528 i never really got the themes of the show prior to that
3565529 however now i am hooked satc speaks to me because of its characters they are all different i think we all have a friend who is similar to a charlotte or a samantha and it makes the show more real and enjoyable to watch i identify least with samantha no one has that much sex i feel samantha is rather slutty and in a day and age where hiv is still a serious problem i think her promiscuity is tacky and irresponsible i would love to give her a good talking to the themes are very true to life satc makes a point of letting the viewers know that no relationship is perfect so often we see shows that depict nothing but moonlight and roses when the female characters are dating these women are real and their problems ring true
3565530 i went with five girlfriends all different ages we saw the movie in a packed theatre in elizabeth nj so many of the women were dressed up as if this was an oscar party it was like being in a room with 250 sisters i will never forget it
3565531 the most striking thing for me about satc was that it does a good job of portraying what i have come to call
3565532 i guess i enjoy the fantasy of watching fabulous women lead fabulous lives
3565533 i find myself identifying with one or other of the characters with each episode the women in the series have experiences that i might not be willing to admit that i admire and or fantasize about the themes are definitely exaggerated but i think the core issues tackled in the show are common to all women issues such as insecurities in relationships striving for perfection and balance in life love affairs with clothes shoes and yearning for happiness are what all women experience
3565534 its ok to be single after the age of 25
3565535 i also love how much these girls depend on each other the friendships are a really central theme other themes like trying to find someone to date who will be on the same page as you your relationships with girlfriends moving in with someone for the first time getting engaged etc we can all identify with
3565536 i see elements of myself in her we have some of the same insecurities and flaws weve made some of the same mistakes
3565537 only because her character is promiscuous i love that she doesnt care what other people think and goes after what she wants i wish i was a bit more like that but she is the extreme example
3565538 i enjoyed hearing the point of view of carrie as she set out to resolve and learn from whatever challenge she and her friends faced
3565539 a big part of the series and the movie is the friendship between the women through thick and thin theyre there for each other offering advice honest opinions without pulling any punches and genuine love
3565540 as a self professed hippie the show made me suddenly want to dress in a more feminine way
3565541 women have been fiercely independent since the womens movement and at times it has not served us in ways that are conducive to raising a family being a good wife or mother most of my women friends in their 40s and early 50s are childless and single though they dont participate in the kind of bed hopping that goes on in the series i find that theyre ill equipped when dealing with men though tremendously successful in their careers
3565542 we watched as the women went through stages of growth and learning through this series we witnessed inadequacies foibles and a look in the mirror of what it means to be a woman in the 21st century navigating between independence career family and relationships
3565543 i wanted to find out what happens next by the time i got home i missed the girls
3565544 it is totally shallow for the most part and the morality can be debated its fun its like science fiction for girls
3565545 theres something about having women who are liberated in different ways in the midst of a life style that is different its wonderful to see women talking about issues but the issues arent really the ones that are shaping the world when you get down to it they are talking about friendship love in the midst of commercialism and sex
3565546 their individual friendships help them get through the problems they encounter these four women are kind of like superheroes for women feminine yet powerful to some extent
3565547 they are powerful at work but they are weak in terms of relating with men they are seeking fulfillment and happiness how they go about is not how most of us would go about
3565548 the show is funny the plot lines are real but exaggerated and that sometimes points out the absurdity of my reality
3565549 i am single and dont date much but like the ladies in the movie i find that my girlfriends are my family also the theme of single in a couples world is handled well and often i find it to be real and it validates my own feelings
3565550 im thinking not much mention of condoms or stds lots of sex but its not really like that in my world there is worry about pregnancy and stds in the real world
3565551 it was almost too much all at once like seeing an entire season in one sitting im hoping for a sequel
3565552 because some of the fantasy and reality does hit home the characters do go through some of the things that we go through in real life
3565553 i am similar to charlotte in personality but i am a writer like carrie i identify with samantha the least but i like her gusto
3565554 the shopping and love of self is more fantasy than reality they are beyond selfish particularly samantha
3565555 i saw the movie with my husband and we both enjoyed it there were tears for charlotte harry and carrie i also got emotional from the scene on the brooklyn bridge
3565556 satc speaks to me because it is a show by and about women seemingly for women though dress and story lines might be for men
3565557 women are taught to compete for men and dress for women as a means of that competition
3565558 satc does not much speak for me 47 year old overweight white midwestern lesbian who has lived with a man for the past 17 years but as a feminist the economic and creative aspects of the show are meaningful
3565559 this fantasy is better than iron manor the hulkand other films of superheroes hitting our theatres i went to see the film by myself i was glad to see the folks but i thought the focus on wedding and things moved too fast and then vaulted to a stop and centered too much on carrie in a way and not on the connections between them i wasnt impressed with the story line much and thought everyone looked and seemed great in the reunion work
3565560 satc seems to make women appear shallow except for their relationships with other women
3565561 the themes in satc and how they are handled are not the true world as i know it or my friends for that matter
3565562 part of our adventure was to wear our hot pink t shirts that we had made with the ny cityscape and embroidered with six in the city in our discussions after the movie none of us liked it but maybe we are old

3565604 it is everything that i think theatre is supposed to be about
3565605 as a play it that break rules its an assault our moral code which at the same time draws audiences into the skewed reality of the couples intense relationship
3565606 the characters are direct and painfully truthful about their love story yet their frankness leaves you with more questions than answers which is totally devastating
3565607 blackbird is a powerhouse piece of theatre that will leave audiences stunned into silence its had that effect on me in rehearsals ive never experienced rehearsal room fireworks as charged or as intense as this michael and liesha are breaking new ground with this work
3565608 we have confined the action into a sliver of space on one side of the room to entrap the characters in a tort and littered room where the characters are forced to confront the debris of their own relationship
3565609 the close proximity of stage to the audience also means views are brought right in close which adds a sense of voyeurism to the experience

3565651 we used the car up a lot and at the end we had no clutch left no brakes left and it was tiring
3565652 coming through the field is really hard work we really worked the car hard to get through the field in the first half of the race
3565653 it was great fun running with those guys at the front ive really got to thank them for not taking me off there it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car
3565654 the wood brothers have given me a great car on both the road courses and ive really got to thank them its great to run well for them
3565655 it was nice to get it the way we did
3565656 i think about the run that dario had for the championship last season and its nice to be able to be in that position after how we lost it last year
3565657 i think we tried to play it kind of safe and just be conservative even in traffic we really didnt rush things the car was fantastic it was strategy in the end it was crazy

3565679 and well see where terry sciubba is living this year
3565680 i always figured that as long as the new mortgage payment was close to what the old one was i could afford the move
3565681 my ex and i joked about it when we were married and we still joke about it today
3565682 when we were married he would sometimes say ill call you from the office when im ready to leave and you can tell me where we live
3565683 when i got out of the police department i was doing security work with developers out here on the island and i began to see the possibilities
3565684 when i was growing up in grade school and in high school he used to take me along to open houses at places he was considering buying super bowl sunday and you know what hell talk real estate all afternoon
3565685 oh absolutely but real estate is what he lives and breathes
3565686 maybe thats why i can be town supervisor ive lived in so many neighborhoods
3565687 im a frustrated developer and real estate broker i love going to open houses
3565688 in an estate purchase as a buyer i can offer lets say 100 000 less than the asking price but the sellers are heirs who want to get rid of this property and 100 000 less might actually translate into only 20 000 less for each of the heirs therefore much more palatable than such a reduced offer might be to a single couple or seller otherwise remember they want to get rid of it they dont want to continue paying the taxes and maintenance
3565689 the process of getting a mortgage was a nightmare for first time home buyers it can be really horrible
3565690 they were saying it would be hard unless you put 20 percent down
3565691 we didnt have the 20 percent to put down it was a nerve racking thing
3565692 and if you didnt have perfect credit then you better have had 20 percent to put down which we didnt
3565693 bills started piling up our credit was messed up it was just a nightmare
3565694 the end result was our son jack needed a house
3565695 thats what everyone wants i grew up in merrick and my wife grew up in bayside and she never had a house before thats what i wanted to do for her and my son
3565696 we were pretty stressed we got married then we had a baby now im pregnant again
3565697 but a bigger house came up for sale a cape a couple of blocks away it was a friend of the family and we got a good deal
3565698 the result from telstra has hurt the market a little bit
3565699 i didnt think it was that bad but it was just the outlook
3565700 the cba was a reasonable result but if you took both out the market would be down anyway today just on what happened offshore

3565738 its almost a hybrid position you still need the two bigger guys inside but the guy in the field is a half linebacker half strong safety type looking at him last year i dont think he could play in the secondary for us and wouldnt have played for us this year but its a perfect position for him with what his talents are
3565739 unless somebody lines up in two tights ends and two backs and wants to go smashmouth thats the only time hes got to be in there to play run defense said obrien he can do that hes not going to do it 65 plays but nobody plays that way in football anymore with all the wideouts everybody has the field spread hes wide to the field so hes got to have skills to be a pass cover hes got to understand the passing game which he did at strong safety and hes got to come in and get in the box when the ball is run its similar to what he did last year but now hes six yards closer to the line of scrimmage than he used to be
3565740 after my second year we changed the defense obrien said
3565741 youve got to get into some type of substitution defense youre almost in nickel defense all the time now anyways
3565742 weve had two surgeries here in the last couple of days
3565743 toney baker has had surgery to clear out some things in his knee so hes on the shelf for a while until he comes back from that
3565744 clem johnson broke his jaw in the scrimmage so hes out for maybe the year
3565745 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us with the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3565746 because i was rumored to be in a deal for mark teixeira so when i just told them they all thought i was messing with them
3565747 no other pc manufacturer delivers the sheer quality power and performance and cutting edge innovation packed into this mobile workstation
3565748 there is a huge demand for the first generation iphones because the battery for the older iphones is stronger
3565749 we are in 51 circuit city stores and are trying to roll it out nationally
3565750 we are giving anywhere from 200 to 300 in instant credit
3565751 the base line of our concept is how do we encourage reuse and keep things out of the landfill
3565752 we hold on to it and it sits in our desk drawer and it depreciates and in the end it ends up in the landfill
3565753 i crawled out of the battle and joined miss havisham where she had taken cover behind a display of generously discounted du maurier novels

3565758 zero jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
3565759 its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here
3565760 hes of questionable sexuality at least as a slug they tell me that these slugs can be either male or female depending thats something i guess that slugs and snails do
3565761 i wasnt aware of that but i have continuity experts that tell me these things and im like i guess jabba is his sons mother and father from a certain point of view its interesting
3565762 all my friends at school are mean to me you are hard on me during practice i want to go on vacation i miss my best friend in california
3565763 when children respond in these kinds of ways deep down theyre not testing limits to upset us theyre testing the limits to see if were really reliable and dependable they want to know if they can trust what we say they dont necessarily want the limit to change its a bit like when you close your front door then turn the knob to check to see if its truly locked youre not wanting to open the door but knowing that the door is secured you feel safer in the same way children dont really want their partents to give in they want to know that theyre reliable
3565764 when a child behaves in ways that are disrespectful or harmful to himself to others his hidden purpose is often to verify the stability of the boundaries this testing has much the same function as a policeman who turns doorknobs at places of business after dark though he tries to open doors he hopes they are locked and secured likewise a child who assaults the loving authority of his parents is greatly reassured when their leadership holds firm and confident
3565765 lets not make that the issue ill put the flag on my lapel
3565766 there are decisions that police fire and ems will have to make

3565770 according to those creepy recruiting websites even while missing most of his senior year with a broken bone coming out of high school and all hes done is gain about 25 pounds in the weightroom now 240lbs and
3565771 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3565772 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3565773 i would like for them to be cautious and make sure they wont fall into north koreas trap

3565776 consejo cautelar no s lo de que la publicaci n de este libro podr a ser ofensiva para algunos miembros de la comunidad musulmana sino que tambi n podr a incitar actos de violencia por parte de un segmento peque o pero radical
3565777 en esta instancia decidimos tras una larga deliberaci n posponer la publicaci n por la seguridad del autor de los empleados de random house de libreros y de cualquier otra persona que estuviera involucrada con la distribuci n y seguridad de la novela
3565778 nadie hablaba de emitir una fatua no era una discusi n violenta
3565779 esta vez el instigador del problema no han sido los radicales isl micos sino el mundo acad mico estadounidense
3565780 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3565781 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3565782 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3565783 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3565784 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3565785 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3565786 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3565787 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3565788 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3565789 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3565790 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3565791 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3565792 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3565793 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3565794 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3565795 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3565796 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3565797 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3565798 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3565802 a science magazine investigation uses clues from a key document unveiled last week to
3565803 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
3565804 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
3565805 the attacks were not entirely unexpected i had been told soon after sept 11 to secure cipro the antidote to anthrax the tip had come in a roundabout way from a high government official and i immediately acted on it i was carrying cipro way before most people had ever heard of it
3565806 the impression that theyre not good may just come from their style they never tell you anything
3565807 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3565808 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3565809 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3565810 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3565811 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3565812 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3565813 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3565814 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3565815 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3565816 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3565817 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3565818 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think

3565822 un desacuerdo sobre el nuevo modelo de financiaci n supondr costes terribles tanto para jos luis rodr guez zapatero como para catalunya
3565823 no a trav s del coraz n sino del bolsillo
3565824 no era buena para los catalanes ni para el conjunto de espa a
3565825 zapatero est metido en el problema y no sabe c mo salir pero l es el presidente del gobierno y tiene que dar una soluci n este es un momento en el que la sensaci n que se est transmitiendo es que el ejecutivo est absolutamente a la deriva y desbordado
3565826 afectar a la propia estabilidad del psoe en referencia al psc y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3565827 lo que todos sabemos es que zapatero aprob el estatut y ahora por lo que se ve no est dispuesto a cumplirlo eso ha originado un problema grav simo dentro del psoe pero a m no me preocupan los problemas del psoe sino los problemas de los espa oles
3565828 us lo ya y ponga su informaci n a nuestra disposici n
3565829 if weve been mabaduchi for so long why is it that we dont have a secret
3565830 no sabemos muy bien donde nos encontramos pero estamos bien y nuestra vida no corre ni ha corrido peligro
3565831 los desprendimientos de tierra eran constantes hasta que detuvieron el tren porque las aguas hab an descalzado la v a
3565832 hemos estado sin comida ni agua y sin tener ninguna informaci n en realidad no sabemos ni d nde estamos ni si las autoridades saben que existimos lo nico cierto es que vamos hacia hanoi y con suerte podremos seguir nuestras vacaciones hasta el d a 21
3565833 acabo de hablar con mi hija y mi yerno bernat y est n molestos porque los sacaron de sapa donde estaban seguros para meternos en un tren tras pagar 67 euros por persona sin las garant as de que pudiera llegar a su destino les dijeron que la v a estaba limpia y no era as creo que no contaban con que siguiera lloviendo en el sur de china y el r o rojo creciera tanto
3565834 el mal estado de las v as f rreas muchas de las cuales est n anegadas ha impedido avanzar hacia la capital vietnamita a los tres trenes en los que viajaban unos 86 espa oles de los 119 que se encuentran en vietnam
3565835 un grupo inmobiliario que tiene intereses dentro y fuera de catalunya

3565837 informaci n es poder y yo misma he visto a toda cuando estaba en la oposici n ausentarse de los plenos al tratar cuestiones urban sticas
3565838 es el mismo caso que pradeda que siempre nos pidi obras p blicas y nunca se lo dimos por desconfianza es complicado garantizar la honorabilidad cuando hay interferencias de intereses privados con los p blicos
3565839 herr medina und herr schindler von der chilenischen botschaft empfingen in der 26 kalenderwoche die band fahrenheit 212 herehara und einen vertreter von smm records
3565840 han pasado 25 a os desde la promulgaci n del c digo de derecho can nico de 1983 y todav a hay mucho camino por andar en su aplicaci n conocer bien el derecho can nico y aplicarlo fielmente es imprescindible para que la iglesia sea un espejo de justicia speculum iustitiae como dijo el papa pablo vi
3565841 esto lleva consigo agreg que la persona cada persona en la iglesia sea plenamente respetada en su dignidad de hombre o mujer y en su dignidad cristiana que sus derechos sean reconocidos en la comunidad eclesial y por cada uno de los fieles de este modo la iglesia ser modelo de justicia para la sociedad civil
3565842 es innegable que vivimos en una nueva estaci n agregativa en la iglesia como dec a el recordado el esp ritu sopla donde quiere y renueva la vida de la iglesia
3565843 la respuesta que el derecho can nico da a estos nuevos desaf os es un complemento necesario pues por un lado no limita el carisma sino que lo hace m s bello confiri ndole una estabilidad y continuidad que es necesaria por otro la perspectiva jur dico can nica permite proteger los derechos de las personas que participan en esas realidades asociativas y tambi n los derechos de las mismas comunidades
3565844 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3565845 es normal que rusia quiera defender sus intereses as como los de los rusos en rusia y los de los rus fonos fuera del pa s es normal igualmente que la comunidad internacional quiera garantizar la integridad la soberan a y la independencia de georgia
3565846 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3565847 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3565848 actitudes infantiles haci ndose pasar por algo que no es
3565849 es lamentable el uso y la usurpaci n que ha hecho de una figura
3565850 i am really excited about this and like what you have
3565851 but what about john mccain at this point as governor kaine said obamas running positive ads and john mccain is running ads about paris hilton and that sort of thing what he called the same old karl rove ads can you get elected president that way
3565852 cross paths with and perhaps serve as advisors to one of the heroes
3565853 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3565854 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3565855 my choices are my own and make no mistake ive loved and been loved if true love turns up on your doorstep and you turn it away thats on you not the job or anything else
3565856 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3565857 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3565858 this is the most extensive campaign of telemarketing calls to consumers on the do not call list ever investigated by my office
3565859 they invaded the homes of thousands of pennsylvania residents with unsolicited and unwanted phone calls marketing mortgage loans that they were not licensed to sell
3565860 this is a business matter that my son cory is working through with his attorney i have no involvement in his company
3565861 we believe that the younger ruppersberger was the sole proprietor of these businesses
3565862 very disturbing because were dealing with an extremely large violation of the do not call list
3565863 the majority of our cases deal with hundreds or thousands of calls
3565864 contact clients that arent being reached by other telemarketing lists because of dnc do not call scrubbing
3565865 it is my understanding that this particular company is on the federal trade commission list of major violators
3565866 if any of these entities are violating the federal do not call rule we want to know about it
3565867 kaine is still working on a transportation plan despite the failure of the recent special session
3565868 he is very sure that state senate democrats will agree to send virginia tax dollars to russia for their roads so democrats will have another excuse to propose tax hikes
3565869 if the obama campaign thinks that this is real foreign policy they had better trim their expectations
3565870 clearly it is all style over substance with a bunch of hair brained schemes obama and kaine would be truly lost if they were in the thick of it
3565871 anyone could have predicted the arched lines of their lowbrow expectations
3565872 kaine brings a message of raised hope a lot more than anyone could have foreseen on foreign policy we democrats have a ridge that is supraorbital this country is going from bush to bushy
3565873 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
3565874 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
3565875 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
3565876 yet laptops were expensive and they never seemed to get any cheaper they just got more complicated
3565877 it is tuned specifically to the needs of children and they i am told pick it up quickly
3565878 mike mitchell we use micro oft because there are several thousand programs at least which dont run on anything else
3565879 just learning those kids reading and writing is a waste we need them in the mines now

3565881 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3565882 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3565883 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3565884 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3565885 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3565886 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3565887 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3565888 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3565889 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3565890 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3565891 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3565892 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3565893 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3565894 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3565895 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3565896 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3565897 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3565898 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3565899 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3565900 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3565901 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3565902 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3565903 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3565904 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3565905 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3565906 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3565907 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3565916 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3565917 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3565918 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3565919 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3565920 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3565921 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3565935 ha dejado que la inercia hiciera aparecer en estos ni os muchos problemas de escritura que de no ser corregidos a tiempo pueden causar serios problemas posturales e incluso de aprendizaje

3565954 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3565955 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3565956 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3565957 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3565958 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3565959 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3565960 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3565961 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3565962 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3565963 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3565964 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3565965 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him
3565966 i dont have the words to describe it you play the game to put yourself in position to be in the playoffs and be in a pennant race now im fortunate enough to have this opportunity
3565967 i was excited to get a chance to play for something meaningful in august and september it also meant leaving a place where i met a lot of great people and fans it was difficult
3565968 we have closed two other pipelines in georgia baku supsa and the south caucasus pipeline which is a gas pipeline

3565973 i will have a meeting with cardinal pell with my lawyer mr peter carp
3565974 i gladly will have a meeting with cardinal pell but we will be debating the issues and discussing the facts otherwise there will be no meeting
3565975 the child we put on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent but in terms of voice all of our team thought yang peiyi was flawless the most outstanding
3565976 when we rehearsed on site there were people from various groups especially a leader from the politburo who when listening to lins voice gave us his opinion it must be changed so we changed it
3565977 fear of having an imperfect performance or something that does not look exactly right
3565978 the girl who was rejected has seen the media praise the other girls star like singing
3565979 both will feel hurt and offended and a lot of people will feel they have been misled all round
3565980 when i told her it was not her voice she breathed out heavily and then said no more about it
3565981 i was worried about her reaction but now i am relieved she is a very calm tolerant and brave girl
3565982 its fascinating as they used to keep things covered up for years
3565983 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3565984 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3565985 other recent bachmannisms include the claim that there isnt actually any wildlife in the areas of the arctic national wildlife refuge where she wants more drilling and the allegation
3565986 nobody seems to want to remember the fact that we had so many successes and come from behind victories in this campaign and they are due in large part to senator clintons leadership
3565987 recently opposed extending tax breaks for the wind power industry
3565988 while visiting his presidential villa on the black sea mccain even nominated saakashvili for a nobel peace prize in 2005
3565989 in any event we have bill referencing the constitutional requirements to be president and hillary referencing the unelectability of obama because of his lack of american roots the clintons have obama in a cross fire and they are preparing to play their ultimate hand
3565990 while i dont support either clinton their mastery here can only be admired of course they couldnt have pooled it off without the help of those pesky bloggers

3566001 lets clarify this with press secretary jesus dureza he should read the resolution it said charter change moves would be subject to timing and content
3566002 it seems you have not talked with the main author senator aquilino pimentel
3566003 when i signed the resolution i thought this would signal the studies for a possible shift to federalism but this should be done after president arroyos term
3566004 the moves for a shift to federalism is all systems go if the senators including senator escudero will not flip flop
3566005 it is all the while our trajectory for the negotiations with the milf moro islamic liberation front
3566006 we are putting our support to the senate which already mustered a substantial number of senators who affixed their signatures to the resolution
3566007 we expect that a similar move in the house of representatives will snowball to concur with the senates overwhelming support to the move this is our way forward in the effort to set up a federal system in mindanao to respond to the aspiration of our muslim communities in the south
3566008 that aim to prolong gloria macapagal arroyos stay in power
3566009 we condemn the maneuvers of the arroyo regime starting from the botched peace process up to its escalation of the armed conflict in mindanao and this the current push for charter change the regime is using the armed conflict to pressure congress into railroading charter change and open the doors wide open for arroyo to stay in power beyond 2010
3566010 that she would do all this at the expense of 130 000 internally displaced refugees is truly abominable
3566011 while it is true that the senate will resist charter change moves the people must be at the forefront of the resistance the broad anti charter change untied front or religious opposition and progressive groups that mobilized in 2006 must again be re activated
3566012 there must also be increased pressure on the government to cease military offensives that have displaced thousands of civilians in north cotabato
3566013 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3566014 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday

3566033 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3566034 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act our message to speaker pelosi is very simple we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve

3566080 said it was one of the funnest adventures hes ever done
3566081 there are so few things our kids will do with us as a family now at their age but this event really allowed us to have fun together

3566151 i just hope all sides to this conflict can come to peaceable terms
3566152 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again

3566165 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3566166 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3566167 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3566168 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit

3566171 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3566172 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3566173 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3566174 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3566178 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3566179 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3566180 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3566181 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3566182 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3566183 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3566184 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3566185 he was probably eight feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3566186 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3566187 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3566188 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3566189 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3566190 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3566191 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3566192 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3566193 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3566194 i do not have any pain or soreness in my knee
3566195 he favours dunking on your head thats what he favours
3566196 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3566197 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3566198 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie

3566221 hasta ahora la imagen de letizia era tan discreta que a veces se hac a invisible ahora el cambio es notable debido a los colores vivos que utiliza y al dise o de los complementos que ha incorporado los nuevos estilismos la han hecho visible
3566222 cualquier cambio merece una adaptaci n y el que se ha producido ha sido progresivo y cuidado hasta conseguir la imagen actual
3566223 los rectos ajustados y con tejidos ca dos potencian su delgadez en cambio los pantalones rectos y anchos con tejidos con cuerpo le aportan volumen en sus piernas
3566224 son correctos para cualquier acto social ya que aportan elegancia y distinci n adem s de altura y un toque femenino

3566233 we saw what that could do for us last year
3566234 lets just put it this way weve got a chance to have a real ly good football team again
3566235 if it gives players a burr under their saddles great
3566236 i do know that in this league theres a fine line between 3 13 and 13 3 but when you support each other good things happen i think they saw that last year i think this team will be focused
3566237 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem through committed action and vigorous enforcement they can provide a powerful and much needed deterrent

3566239 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting

3566256 she is in submission to me and if she did not preach she would not be a submissive wife since i have instructed her to use her spiritual gifts to the fullest
3566257 what is a wife to do you tell me i must learn in submission and i am out of order i am aware that scripture tells me to submit to my husband and my husband has told me i must preach do you have any advice for how i stay submissive and do as he directs but not do as he directs since a woman preacher is an abomination

3566259 if the company is forced by regulators to bring these 3 billion in auction rate securities on its book we estimate it might have to write down roughly 350 million in auction rate securities losses
3566260 looking ahead we continue to believe that our innovative and easy to use product is well positioned to address a significant unmet need in the diabetes therapy market
3566261 limited too was the brand that introduced great fashion to tween girls but our customers are looking for the next great thing and their parents want more value for their dollar
3566262 its a beautiful process where everybodys thinking and everythings out on the table
3566263 so we hope that people continue to give us ideas like that and think creatively because everything is out on the table right now

3566278 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3566279 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3566280 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3566281 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3566282 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3566283 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3566284 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems

3566287 south ossetia is not a territory not a country not a regime it is a joint venture of siloviki generals and ossetian bandits for making money in a conflict with georgia
3566288 just to line up the airlift sorties wouldve taken weeks
3566289 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3566290 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3566291 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3566292 he saw three letters a k a g and a b
3566293 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3566294 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3566295 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3566296 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3566297 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3566298 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3566299 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3566300 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3566301 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3566302 when i was young i thought that i had to be perfect for people to love me i thought that if i ever did something wrong their love would be withdrawn we need to give ourselves permission to be human to try and to stumble to be momentarily weak and to feel shame but to overcome that shame with moments of strength courage and generosity
3566303 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it

3566308 delivering a polished game experience is one of our top priorities and this relationship helps us achieve that goal for blizzard gamers who choose amd graphics cards
3566309 t he story about senator mccain and lobbyists and ethics and money that continues
3566310 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3566311 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3566312 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3566313 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3566314 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3566315 i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia
3566316 as you know through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3566317 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3566318 russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g 8 so they should be excluded
3566319 probably had a higher opinion of russian prime minister vladimir putin than i do
3566320 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3566321 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
3566322 you see it was the only workers i could get
3566323 we are now dealing with the serious issue of managing our economy we are running this job seriously of course there are people who couldnt care so much anwar ibrahim is one particular person
3566324 that is his business while that is so our immediate interest is to protect the safety of our people
3566325 it does not really reflect on one or two persons leadership im not going to say something to please people when things are not well you say it so that people recognise what needs to be done
3566326 every morning when i read the newspapers i see a man saying hes going to take over the government things coming out of malaysia are not that good at the moment and the present government may not be in power in september
3566327 we are also puzzled every day we read the newspapers too
3566328 its not that i dont like to do business with singaporeans but its very tiring to move in and out
3566329 they were asking the government to fund the project worth some rm10 billion

3566332 the whole roof of the factory and the cables disappeared
3566333 the net effect is that we are adding one more ball to the drums
3566334 with the addition of florida powerball has the chance to become even more exciting by keeping the jackpot levels up where players like to see them but we also want to do some special things with the game even though many players focus on large powerball jackpots we still want to create lots of millionaires and we also want to create more winners with better overall odds
3566335 the price of a powerball ticket remains unchanged at 1 even though our players know that the cost of everything else has gone up since powerball sales commenced over 16 years ago we didnt want to raise powerballs price in our current economy powerball players will continue to have the option to play the game for 1 or to play the game with enhanced prizes for 2 by using power play
3566336 we wanted to give our players the power to choose and with many of our newer member lotteries more than half of our players have chosen the benefits of the 2 power play option
3566337 the match 5 bonus feature allows us to occasionally create a rolling match 5 pool that should offer even more fun and greater prizes for our players
3566338 the technology necessary to put these cars on the road and keep them moving exists today the question is not if hydrogen powered vehicles will be available commercially but when
3566339 we really like the neighborhood setting we live a couple of blocks away so being able to have him here is really helpful to us overall we really like the school

3566341 parents need to step up and do our part so the schools can make ayp
3566342 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3566343 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3566344 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3566345 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3566346 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3566347 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats
3566348 at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3566349 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3566350 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3566351 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3566352 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3566353 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used

3566361 you hate to see that knowing that potentially if the technology had been as good when the crime was committed someone else would not have been killed

3566366 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3566367 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3566368 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3566369 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3566370 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3566371 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3566372 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3566373 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3566374 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else

3566380 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3566381 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3566382 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims

3566403 si ha habido absoluta correcci n por parte de todos
3566404 s me encantar a es una ilusi n grande me encantar a poder vestir la camiseta e la selecci n creo que todo jugador trabaja para eso para poder vestir alg n d a en alg n momento la camiseta de su selecci n
3566405 ahora creo que se abre un poco m s la puerta para los naturalizados como citaban a vuoso a leandro la otra vez entonces hay que seguir trabajando d a a d a tratando de hacer bien las cosas en tu equipo a medida que nos vaya bien aqu con tigres van a voltear a ver para este lado
3566406 para m ser a algo importante y ser a un orgullo poder vestir la camiseta te digo uno siempre trabaja para llegar a lo m ximo y creo que lo m ximo ser a la camiseta de la selecci n ojal alg n d a me toque pero para eso tengo que seguir trabajando de la misma manera que se viene trabajando hasta ahora
3566407 creo que es diferente el nimo para todos creo que es muy bueno el ambiente en s en los entrenamientos es totalmente diferente as que estamos contentos con lo que estamos pasando hasta ahora
3566408 pero sabemos que falta mucho que esto reci n comienza que tuvimos un comienzo bueno a base de humildad a base de trabajar de hacer lo que corresponde dentro de la cancha y sabemos que todav a falta bastante y que tenemos que tratar de seguir por este camino y pensar que no se ha logrado nada que falta mucho
3566409 s eso es fundamental reci n van tres fechas no hemos logrado nada tuvimos un inicio bueno nada m s pero ahora viene lo m s dif cil mantenerse por ese camino y depende nicamente de nosotros y la humildad que tengamos nosotros para seguir trabajando
3566410 como mexicano esperas que le vaya bien a tus compatriotas
3566411 contento creo que todos estamos a la espera de buenos resultados en jugos ol mpicos y obviamente como mexicano esperas que le vaya bien a tus compatriotas quiz en esta delegaci n no hay tantas esperanzas en cuanto a medallas pero es una delegaci n joven que un futuro se pueden esperar m s
3566412 no lo pude ver pero cuando me levant me enter que ganaron medalla de bronce pero contento porque es la primera medalla y ojal vengan muchas m s
3566413 para nosotros es jornada doble ya urge la victoria y esperamos que vengan m s puntos en este par de partidos en una semana corta se pueden sumar puntos que hacen falta ya son necesarios los puntos sobre todo que vivimos de los resultados
3566414 no gamos nada con preocuparnos somos conscientes que estos puntos que estamos dejando ir nos pueden servir al final del torneo y no queda m s que trabajar bien las jornadas que restan para recuperar de cierta forma lo que hemos perdido
3566415 estoy consciente de que fue una jugada viril fuerte al bal n yo en la disputa del bal n consegu eso ganar el bal n por la inercia de la jugada por el impulso que llevaba en la carrera alcanzo a pegarle pero es una jugada fuerte sin ninguna malicia es un compa ero de profesi n y se respeta creo que eso no va conmigo de ir con malicia
3566416 te quitan ese ritmo la continuidad que te da el jugar cada fin de semana hay que esperar pienso que no va a pasar nada esperemos que la directiva en ese aspecto me apoye
3566417 claro por ese lado abogo de que nos soy violento y por el hecho de que si este comentario le llega al jugador lvarez que sepa que nunca fue con la intenci n o malicia de agredirlo le pido una disculpa si l piensa que yo llegue con idea de lastimarlo para nada que fue as
3566418 lo hemos hecho bien en cuanto al accionar no en cuanto a resultados
3566419 ni me preocupa ni me quita el sue o la situaci n lo hemos hecho bien en cuanto al accionar no en cuanto a resultados hemos merecido mejores resultados pero no hemos podido concretarlos dentro del terreno de juego
3566420 hemos fallado en lo individual pero la realidad es que no hemos conseguido ni un solo punto tengo una gran fe una gran confianza que igual vamos a revertir todo esto ni estoy preocupado ni me quita el sue o
3566421 lamentamos la lesi n de mario estamos platicando con el presidente de indios respecto de la posibilidad de contratar otro extranjero pero primero tenemos que resolver la situaci n de lvarez para poder hacer otra contrataci n en esta semana posiblemente ya est resuelto tenemos cuatro o cinco opciones estamos trabajando en eso
3566422 hay que sacar la cara no hay que esconderla al fin y al cabo sabemos que es una situaci n complicada que nadie la quer a pero as es hay que tomarlo como es y trabajar para sacar esto adelante tengo la confianza en que esto saldr adelante
3566423 creo que el reporte no est bien preciso de lo que sucedi el rbitro puso unas acciones que creo en el video est clar simo que no puede ser
3566424 a qui n se lo cobr s y a qui n no se lo cobr s eso es lo que se tiene que considerar aparte fui tres cuatro o cinco metros porque no me escuchaba y ten a que explicarle algunas cosas por eso digo que no hubo ofensa totalmente as muy fuerte como para dar la cantidad de partidos que me han dado
3566425 pero bueno si esto es un inicio el inicio empieza ahora creo que va a empezar lindo esto
3566426 guadalajara es un equipo grande y hay que ver a qu rbitro mandan hay partidos importantes y no estaba yo cuando a monterrey le expulsan a tres jugadores en una final
3566427 ya el a o pasado hay jugadas para discutir y creo que esto es un aviso s la pena es hacia m pero estar cada vez m s atento y si tengo que ser el jefe en la voz cantante lo voy a ser
3566428 a m me gusta que me ganen pero no comparto tantas equivocaciones de un ser humano s considero que el puesto de rbitro es dificil simo es un ser humano pero tantos criterios diferentes dentro de un partido eso es lo que no acepto
3566429 yo quiero rbitros de primer nivel porque a m me gusta que me gane el rival no por una consecuencia de equivocaciones
3566430 llevo treinta a os en m xico y hoy empiezo a presentarme nada m s y si tengo que ir a la federaci n ir a exponer mis puntos de vista entonces presente estoy y si a mi equipo lo perjudican voy a tener que hablar

3566438 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3566439 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back

3566453 have you ever made a wish on a falling star
3566454 well im sure some of them did i dont remember all the wishes ive ever made on falling stars
3566455 well if i made a wish last night do you think itll come true
3566456 maybe as long as you didnt wish for something impossible like being named queen of england or something
3566457 do you think that getting to meet the jonas brothers is impossible
3566458 well i suppose that could happen but it would be extremely rare like that it has probably never ever happened
3566459 im sure it would be and going very fast i dont think youd want to actually catch one
3566460 probably i think youd just rather see where it fell and then go and check it out

3566464 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after the dowry of miss lydia clark i devoted myself to the trio of books in the tales of london series then wrote a table by the window my contemporary novel
3566465 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends

3566476 its been going on for a few days with him and i told him if it doesnt get any better with nomar coming back this was probably one of the options we have and he was ok with it
3566477 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3566478 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3566479 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3566480 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3566481 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3566482 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3566483 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3566484 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3566485 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3566486 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3566487 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3566488 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3566489 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him

3566504 ive heard of new charges with respect to theft offenses receiving stolen property and possibly other lab sites
3566505 the change in the supplies and equipment was so incremental so barely noticeable that during three years its possible it could have happened if all of these items walked right out the door in a matter of a week it would have raised a lot of red flags

3566508 ipass is the established market leader for global enterprise mobility and was our obvious choice when looking for a partner in this field
3566509 enterprises need to cater for the requirements of a very heterogeneous group of mobile workers and for ipass to be able to offer various access technologies including a choice of mobile broadband networks in japan will help meet these requirements we are looking forward to working with ipass and equipping its customers with high speed mobile broadband communications provided by our mvno service with two distinctive mobile networks in japan
3566510 this partnership with iij one of japans leading mvnos will further solidify the mobile broadband presence of ipass in the critical japanese market
3566511 some of the worlds largest companies count on ipass to keep their users connected regardless of their location with multiple nationwide mobile broadband services and over 27 000 wi fi hotspots in asia alone we can offer business users a unique combination of coverage simplicity and affordability

3566517 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3566518 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3566519 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3566520 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3566521 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3566522 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3566523 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3566524 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3566525 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3566526 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3566527 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3566528 what is he worth now can he give us our houses back
3566529 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world

3566537 and im sure the rest of the family will just love to lynch me
3566538 she told him where he could take his ego and go
3566539 it really would mean a lot to her if you came shes never lost faith in you and she agreed with you about albus and harry
3566540 but i do not wear robes any more and i have to let my people know where im going
3566541 shed like to know all about what youve been doing trust me wesley not everyone was on albus or your familys side about you
3566542 let me call angel and them and tell them to pack
3566543 yeah im fine im just trying to figure out why you decided that we needed to come to kansas
3566544 once mr giles figured out that your abilities werent from being the slayer i figured we needed to get away for awhile besides i havent seen martha since you were 11 she never even knew that your father and i got a divorce
3566545 good now why dont try to rest itll be another couple of hours before we get to smallville
3566546 the watchers council has discovered that your powers are not slayer related
3566547 they were courageous as to how you could have kept the powers after you had died they had a coven of witches perform a spell they found out that the only active slayer is faith here when you died 2 years ago the slayer powers were passed to kendra and when she died last year they were passed to faith
3566548 so what youre saying is that there was only one slayer at a time
3566549 i wasnt talking to you mister i was talking to giles giles what else did the council find out
3566550 well um it seems that your powers um are not of um this world
3566551 it seems that you are from another planet but they arent sure which planet
3566552 well than they better find out because i have a feeling that they arent going to like it if i get angrier than i already am
3566553 they are working on it buffy but they think that the planet may have been destroyed about 14 years ago
3566554 let them know to figure it out now if you will excuse me im going to go and take my anger out on the demons and vampires in this town
3566555 i just stopped to get directions to the kent farm its been so long since ive been there that i wanted to make sure that i knew where i was going its weird when i asked for directions i got this weird look from everyone in the shop a couple of nice girls gave me directions though

3566557 i know mom i just hate being cooped up i dont understand it
3566558 youve been that way ever since your father and i found you we never understood it and youve never out grew it

3566565 he was something to kern county and bakersfield himself and cared about its citizens

3566569 they made very generous donations to our sports teams of each of the facilities that they used
3566570 the director of the commercial said we were amazing to work with and were a great location
3566571 so i think hopefully it means more business from the film and commercial industry for bakersfield

3566576 defendants cannot have committed fraud if they did not know at the time that the failure to provide additional information was misleading
3566577 plaintiffs amended complaint fails to allege facts both 1 as to when defendant had information about non pml opportunistic infection and 2 that the information available sufficiently suggested a causal connection between tysabri and non pml opportunistic infections
3566578 not nearly so compelling as opposing inferences from the undisputed facts in the record
3566579 sufficiently alleged that defendants had any reason to know their statements were misleading before february 18 2005
3566580 a strong inference of scienter on the part of biogen and other individual defendants cannot be drawn
3566581 finally realized the impact of the off label marketing and the warning letter
3566582 the unreasonable inference that a public revelation caused a price drop three months later
3566583 the complaint sufficiently alleges a causal relationship between 1 the increase in sales resulting from the off label marketing 2 the warning letters effects on viread orders and 3 the warning letters effect on gileads share price
3566584 perhaps what truly motivated the dismissal was the district courts incredulity
3566585 is not facially implausible the courts skepticism is best reserved for later stages when the plaintiffs case can be rejected on evidentiary grounds
3566586 a limited temporal gap between the time of the misrepresentation is publicly revealed and the subsequent decline does not render a plaintiffs theory of loss causation per se implausible

3566589 continued the rebound that started in the second half of 2007
3566590 market capitalization losses for defendant firms associated with filings in the first half of 2008 were higher than the average semiannual loss in the eleven preceding years
3566591 was partly due to a strong stock market with low volatility
3566592 a chinese court upheld the death sentence of a former securities trader charged with embezzling 97 56 million yuan 14 31 million

3566596 2008 trends subprime and auction rate cases continue to drive filings and large settlements keep averages high
3566597 if market volatility is higher during a quarter controlling for market returns filings are likely to be higher in the same quarter
3566598 the probability of a suit rises with the size of the price decline whereas only 9 of drops of 20 30 are followed by a shareholder class action within three months almost 31 of drops of 40 or more are followed by a filing within that time frame

3566601 it is extremely distasteful that an independent public official should feel himself obliged to give way to threats of any sort although i wish the world were a better place where honest and conscientious public servants were not put in impossible situations such as this i agree that his decision was lawful
3566602 the sfo director was convinced that saudi arabia wasnt bluffing

3566606 isaac hayes will forever be known as a gifted musical genius an oscar and grammy award winning artist with his own star on the hollywood walk of fame we have all been anticipating how exciting it was going to be to have him be part of this classic
3566607 now the planned tribute has even greater meaning as throngs of attendees will also be coming to pay their respects to mr hayes life and legacy
3566608 this is of course tragic news about the loss of such a giant in the music business stax records was in many ways the house that isaac built as a prolific songwriter and performer and i cant think of a more fitting way to show our gratitude for everything he gave us than to fill the l a coliseum with all of his fans
3566609 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3566610 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3566611 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3566612 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3566613 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3566614 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3566615 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3566616 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3566617 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3566618 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3566619 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3566620 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3566621 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3566622 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3566623 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3566624 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3566625 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3566626 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3566627 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3566628 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3566629 he started vomiting talking about being dizzy headed and after he vomited he kind of went into convulsions and kind of passed out or whatever
3566630 and then on the same day we find the second noose people just end up getting sick and it wasnt just one or two between thursday and friday i think there was a total of ten to twelve people that had taken sick
3566631 theres things written about women theres things written about hispanics theres things written about blacks so but thats something thats common but the spirit of the hill is been more about cooperation than anything
3566632 im not sure that that is true that was mention just this week and that is the first time ive heard about it
3566633 if you talk this is what will happened and it pretty much worked because we have people with evidence thats kind of afraid to come forth because theyre afraid that hanner is going to terminate them
3566634 his termination had nothing to do with anything else but his behavior

3566642 these words may have come from a book but they all came from a mother who loves her children so much the way i love you now even though i havent seen you yet in gods time i will be a wife and then a mother someday you will be laid next to me in my bed after i gave all my strength to bring you out of my womb and into this world i may get very very weak in giving birth to you but you are worth more than that nothing will give us greater joy in this world than for us your parents to see your beautiful angelic face for the first time and have an angel right before our eyes right then and there
3566643 brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states

3566645 brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure
3566646 prior to a court determination the insurer has the unilateral right to determine whether defense costs are covered
3566647 authorize it to apply its exclusions to deny coverage unilaterally and thus to refuse to advance defense costs unless and until a court determines that the costs are covered
3566648 falls within the policys insuring agreement it is covered unless and until there is a final determination that an exclusion applies
3566649 in essence the central dispute among the parties centers on who bears the burden regarding whether defense costs are ultimately covered
3566650 can hardly be said to make an unambiguous change in the provisions literal meaning
3566651 seems at best an unusual way to effectuate a fundamental change in the parties expectations
3566652 makes eminent sense as adopting the insurers interpretation would effectively render the advancement obligation worthless
3566653 wants the unilateral right to refuse a payment called for in the policy the policy should clearly state that right

3566658 tellabs proves to be no deterrent to securities class action filings
3566659 cases are actually more likely to survive a motion to dismiss after tellabs than before
3566660 even in formerly less demanding circuits tellabs did not set the pleading bar at a level that deters filings
3566661 tellabs plainly has not operated to deter securities class action filings to the contrary the data confirms sic that filing opportunities remain wide open for plaintiffs
3566662 there is no dispute that no court has held and no jury has every found that at amp t or any of the defendants in the common stock litigation engaged in any deliberate dishonest fraudulent or criminal act or omission
3566663 shall not be liable to make any payment in connection with any claim brought about or contributed to in fact by any dishonest fraudulent or criminal act or omission
3566664 for deliberate dishonest fraudulent or criminal acts or omissions upon such finding is material to the cause of action so adjudicated
3566665 no fact finder considered all the evidence and rendered a finding
3566666 the adjudication contemplated in the policy does not as the excess insurer asserts mean an adjudication within the coverage dispute it means an adjudication in the underlying action
3566667 ah love could you and i conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we shatter it to bits and then remold it nearer to the hearts desire

3566671 i wanted to point out that the fmf capital class action which settled last year refer here was a class action brought against a us company in canadian courts with respect to alleged misrepresentations made by fmf regarding subprime exposure and risks you were technically correct because fmf was a us company which traded on the toronto stock exchange but i still wanted to bring that case to your attention

3566683 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball and have no fear or wonder of which pitcher is going to show up i feel really good about where i am right now and i feel that has something to do with why the red sox picked me up
3566684 what happens is theres an internal impingement going on when i get my arm up and accelerate through the slot
3566685 you keep repeating that a hundred some times its eventually going to want to shut down im trying to grit my teeth now and get through it but i think they made the right decision on nipping it in the bud now so hopefully i can be healthy in september down the stretch
3566686 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3566687 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3566688 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3566689 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3566690 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3566691 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there

3566739 so far i have been trying to forget and i have not yet read any of the
3566740 with my two sisters mrs appleton the wife of e d appleton the publisher and mrs robert c cornell i went abroad about a month ago because of the death of another sister lady drummond in paris on our return we booked passage on the titanic as we all felt she was the biggest and safest ship in the world on the homeward bound trip with us was my friend miss evans who apparently died with so many other brave persons that night
3566741 up to the night of the shipwreck our voyage was the usual one at this
3566742 i was just retiring that night when we struck the iceberg there was
3566743 our stateroom was on the a deck there being only another deck above
3566744 we could hear others leaving their staterooms and asking what was the
3566745 it was some little time after midnight that capt smith followed by
3566746 then we saw the men lowering away the lifeboats and the women were
3566747 boatload after boatload mostly of women were sent away from the ship
3566748 i do not know just what time it could have been when some of the men called to miss evans and me to get into the boat three or four men seized miss evans and started to lift her over the rail which came to our chests but she repelled them and cried out for them to put me into the boat first as i had children
3566749 well those men took her at her word and put her down on the deck
3566750 i had not seen any boat being prepared there and i thin the order was
3566751 i have never seen miss evans since that awful moment when she bade the
3566752 when our boat pulled away from the side of the titanic she was so far
3566753 our boat was very poorly manned and equipped one of the men of the
3566754 even at the time we pulled away the doomed sea queens lights were
3566755 moreover i doubt if there was ever a finer exhibition of unflinching
3566756 as soon as we had gotten away a short distance it was apparent that the
3566757 that stewardess did know how to row and she instructed the other man in
3566758 she said that helping to row kept away the cold so i also took hold of an oar and assisted in my feeble way just to keep warm
3566759 we had not been away from the titanics side more than 15 minutes
3566760 when the end came for the steamship from the way she sank i
3566761 you can imagine the feelings of those in the boats as they watched the
3566762 we had rowed only a comparatively short distance from the titanic when
3566763 presently some of the persons in the boat said they thought they could
3566764 it was a floating capsized lifeboat from the titanic with about 30 men
3566765 the men in our boat called to the others to say that we could take only
3566766 by this time we must have had as many as 60 persons in our lifeboat
3566767 it seemed a long time before we got the many boats from the ship
3566768 i do not know just what time it was that the carpathia came to our aid
3566769 from what i saw and heard it seems that the lifeboat could not have
3566770 i heard nothing of the kind when were leaving the steamship an officer did display a revolver and threatened to shoot anybody who dared to try to leap into our boat he did fire one shot into the air to back up what he said but there was no actual shooting then or at any other time that i know anything about
3566771 geez that makes me feel good to know that you cried because you were pg with me
3566772 the federal prosecutor who sent my congressman off to the big house was bob barr something i will forever be grateful for
3566773 whenever you get libertarians into a room together even if they agree on everything theyll find something to argue about
3566774 the one thing thats missing from the republican party is any sense of excitement
3566775 neither of the two major parties has any vision or leadership whatsoever it seems as if they not only have no leadership or vision or agenda for the american people but they go out of their way to avoid it
3566776 hey do you know who this is this young woman is actually the owner of burger king shes here checking on all her employees and satellite locations she travels the country doing quality control for her fast food empire and will be down in rapid city south dakota tomorrow
3566777 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3566778 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3566779 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

3566800 expect a great time and good bang for their buck
3566801 you cant come to any type of function these days and get what you get at the fair from the rides at the carnival to seeing different agriculture and horticulture which in todays world a lot of people dont often get a chance to see
3566802 youve got kids today that dont know where milk comes from
3566803 they dont have that total concept of the farm and what it takes to raise an animal and everything
3566804 i think we can do that with good weather people are staying closer to home and want reasonable entertainment close to home
3566805 were here to meet their expectations i think we can make everyone from mom and pop and grandma to all the little ones happy
3566806 theyve been doing water collection and all the waste from vendors is composted and that compost goes toward organic gardens and shrubbery all year round
3566807 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3566808 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3566809 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3566810 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3566811 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3566812 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3566813 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3566814 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3566815 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3566816 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3566817 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3566818 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3566819 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3566820 die sorge georgiens um die territoriale einheit ist im geist des textes enthalten

3566837 would not be in the best interest of the community
3566838 if senate democrats are as green as they claim to be they will block this despicable effort to derail ocean protection and weaken a vital environmental law
3566839 it is more than a bit ironic that we have a coastal state democrat trying to prevent president bush from protecting the environment
3566840 in trying to undermine the antiquities act senator landrieu has shown that there is no limit to what she will do to advance the interests of the oil industry
3566841 president bush had ample precedent for establishing a large monument his predecessors both republicans and democrats used the law to protect vast landscapes including what are now olympic glacier bay katmai joshua tree death valley and grand teton national parks
3566842 senator landrieu is dredging up a discredited argument that was put to rest a century ago when theodore roosevelt used the antiquities act to protect the grand canyon
3566843 we encourage president bush to follow through on proposals to establish more marine monuments in the meantime senate democrats should deny landrieu any opportunity to move her misguided proposal
3566844 the antiquities act has served america well for more than a century at a time of mounting pressure on natural resources the law is needed more than ever as a tool for presidents to give immediate protection to our countrys heritage
3566845 america doesnt need politicians weakening its effectiveness in pursuit of parochial or vindictive agendas
3566846 gt told reporters in new york that the international community needs to put as much pressure on the rebels as it has on the government with which they have been fighting since 2003 to end the conflict
3566847 i want to say it again and again that it takes two to tango
3566848 lets not put too much searchlight on one party lets also put enough searchlight on the other party
3566849 i am not in any way saying that the government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure especially now that we have a joint mediator should be exerted on both sides
3566850 they will have to end on the negotiation table because militarily its clear no side will win the war in darfur
3566851 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3566852 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3566853 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3566854 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3566855 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3566856 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3566857 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3566858 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3566859 cr ticas s o sempre bem vindas no caso ela falou da conserva o em fun o dos gastos do pan quanto dengue ela deve ter dito outra coisa e o rep rter n o entendeu pois em 2007 com o programa do minist rio da sa de com a prefeitura pan sem dengue nunca se fez maior a o preventiva
3566860 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3566861 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3566862 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3566863 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3566864 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3566865 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3566866 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3566867 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3566868 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3566869 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3566870 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3566871 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3566872 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3566873 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3566874 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3566875 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3566883 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3566884 breakfast is the most important meal of day but fewer and fewer people have time in the morning to sit down and eat
3566885 our new breakfast bowls are easy to pick up and transport so you can enjoy a satisfying breakfast anytime anywhere
3566886 people are willing to spend more time pay higher prices and enjoy the occasion
3566887 these are people who when they are eating with one hand the wheel in the other hand and a phone wedged against their ear theyre in heaven
3566888 this is an opportunity to satisfy a different type of occasion
3566889 the 168 billion stimulus package congress passed at the beginning of the year
3566890 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3566891 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count

3566936 i dont regret saying it because i think it made leisel sit down and have a look at herself
3566937 she was a spoilt brat then and i dont make any excuses for calling her that mainly because of what she did on the blocks when she turned around and she spat water at brooke hansons feet
3566938 i would retract that now after her swim the other day because i think leisel has shown herself to be a gracious mature champion
3566939 ill be the first one to say that but i had to say that because thats what i felt at the time
3566940 she had a journey to do and shes done her journey
3566941 at 14 years of age when i saw her in sydney walking on the deck with her then coach

3566959 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat

3567229 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3567230 well be playing a texas team and i dont know anything about them but i do know our guys can play i feel we have a real good shot at reaching the semifinals i think our kids have a lot of heart so ill be disappointed if we dont make the semis
3567231 when the kids were 12 they were fifth in the state cal ripken league tournament and when they were 13 they won the state babe ruth 13 year old championship and just missed a spot in the pacific northwest regional semifinals by one run
3567232 theyll all go to mount vernon nine of them will be freshmen and the other two will be sophomores
3567233 its time to take a break but im sure excited about this season
3567234 ive been inspired by a man with a great love for teaching kids how to play the game right jerry smoot and by my coaches at baker ron lepper rob gray and shane evans
3567235 we have a lot of discipline and they know they have to follow the rules
3567236 and the kids arent allowed to swear thats the way jerry smoot taught us when we were kids i also have to say this is a great group of parents which has helped a lot
3567237 we had a tough time and that was one time it seemed we didnt work hard and we didnt play with heart
3567238 this helped the kids realize what they needed to do to accomplish their goals
3567239 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries

3567245 the low enrolment is due to the migration of residents to the city this has left only old people in these areas as the younger generation has gone elsewhere in search of greener pastures
3567246 perhaps the state government and the state education department should look into the matter and decide on the next course of action
3567247 it does not make sense for the schools with low enrolment to continue operating

3567260 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3567261 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3567262 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3567263 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3567264 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3567265 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3567266 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3567267 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3567268 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3567269 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3567270 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3567279 its vital for operators to provide consumers with added value incentives to maintain and grow their business

3567292 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3567293 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3567294 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3567295 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3567296 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3567297 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3567298 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3567299 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir
3567300 well i am a person who goes and thinks by my heart i do whatever my heart tells me to do i am not sure what man management is the team is like my own family i treat them the way a person will treat his own family
3567301 i think my team members were obviously there behind me other than that my family and friends are always behind me
3567302 i will play the way the team requires me to play and i will come onto bat whenever the team requires me to do so it is not an experiment
3567303 there is irfan pathan who is doing quite well i am sure players like praveen kumar piyush chawla and others will come off age virender sehwag is bowling really well
3567304 we have a good 11 and our bench strength is also not that bad in fact we have to leave out world class bowlers like r p singh or piyush chawla from a team also batsmen like robin uthappa manoj tiwary do not find a place in the 11 this certainly shows that we have a good amount of support players
3567305 i feel we should play according to our strengths neither has australia or england or south africa changed their pitches for us so i dont see any reason why should we change our pitches
3567306 we as a team will try not to wilt under pressure world cup is long time away and i am sure if you see the combination can only be fixed some months before the world cup so as of now i am not thinking about the world cup but thinking about getting the right combination so that we can win more consistently
3567307 medicare should role into town once every two years with a silent auction to set rates providers bid on the cpt rate for all other providers within that regional district but heres the kicker the winning provider gets a 25 bonus for that procedural code for one of those two years as a reward for coming in with the lowest bid

3567339 i took modern class i took ballet classes and i took some jazz classes but i wasnt technically trained like william mark or matt i just took classes and i knew what everything was i didnt want to go into the competition dumbfounded and act like i didnt know what anything was i felt like if you want to do well and be a well rounded dancer that you should know a lot of the different styles of dance i took classes but i wasnt a technically trained dancer of course
3567340 i started taking class when i was about ten but it was only in the summer because i was a real sports fan i would always run track and i was the varsity running back in high school and i would mostly play sports dance wasnt that big for me i was really a sports person so it was always in the summer if i were to add up all the technical training as we would say it would probably be about two and a half years maybe almost three
3567341 that whenever you feel like youre exhausted and you cant give anymore you have a lot more to give the show pushes you that hard we didnt know our limits this show pushes you to your limit and it doesnt accept anything less than your best im a much better dancer than i was before i started the competition now its ridiculous
3567342 we do dance a lot of hours and it wasnt that big of a deal we really thought we were okay were fine now we just forgot to drink and replenish our bodies we were just concentrating on having a good show and doing a good job that we kind of forgot to drink water but everything is fine now its cool
3567343 we always hoped we would but you never really know if you would i would always hope to but it was just so crazy in a way i didnt but i would always hope for the best
3567344 i was just really shocked i was just waiting for her to say twitchs name because i knew a lot of people loved twitch it was really overwhelming i was really just overjoyed and i was so happy really happy

3567362 the trusts defensive qualities will ensure that it is well placed to perform strongly in the more challenging environment we face with uncertainties in global financial markets and high interest rates
3567363 there is some evidence to suggest that property values around the world are coming under pressure and it is therefore possible that the trust may face asset devaluations in the future
3567364 we expect that any downward movement in the trusts property values would be reasonably contained given the quality of the trusts portfolio

3567690 the last few days four or five days weve seen one of the most unexpected crises in the world as the russians moved into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
3567691 the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be
3567692 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3567693 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3567694 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3567695 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3567696 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now
3567697 clearly russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g8 so they should be excluded and i think long term they must pay a price for this act which is clearly at the best you could call it a gross and outrageous over reaction to what might be viewed by some as provocation

3567702 i think it depends on whether they think theyve achieved their objectives or not i think they want a regime change they want a compliant person in charge in tbilisi and i think they want control of the energy supply and i think its part of this also this effort to re exert age old russian influence in the region and that applies to azerbaijan to ukraine and either countries in the region who will i think they believe will take learn a lesson from this experience that georgias had
3567703 china is a closed society so nbc is essentially opening doors for the other parts of ge
3567704 for those reasons the olympics are working out quite well for ge

3567767 love is the only game never postponed due to darkness
3567768 love is when there are a million things you want to say to someone but when they look you in the eyes and hold you in their arms nothing in life matters other than being with that person at that moment
3567769 love is when you find yourself spending every wish on him
3567770 love is looking at him and knowing that even if you cant be with him you feel happy because he is happy with someone else
3567771 love is like a golden chain that link our hearts together and if you ever break that chain youll break my heart forever

3567810 let me be as clear as i can be i intend to end this war my first day in office i will bring the joint chiefs of staff in and i will give them a new mission and that is to end this war responsibly deliberately but decisively
3567811 to retain flexibilitiy as violence declines in iraq without abandoning a central promise of his campaign that if elected he would end the war
3567812 the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability
3567813 that doesnt take into account what they military leaders anticipate might be some sort of change in conditions
3567814 mr obama cant afford not to update his iraq policy once he has the conversations hes promising with u s commanders he will have plenty of information that contradicts the notion of his rigid plan iraqs improvement means that american forces probably can be reduced next year 2009 but it would be folly to begin a forced march out of the country without regard to the risks of renewed sectarian warfare and escalating intervention in the country by iran and other of iraqs neighbors
3567815 mr obama in iraq did he really find support for his withdrawal plan
3567816 neither u s commanders nor iraqs principal political leaders actually support obamas 16 month strategy
3567817 iraqi prime minister malikis timetable for withdrawal would extend at least seven months beyond mr obamas

3567820 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3567821 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3567822 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3567823 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
3567824 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today

3567828 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
3567829 what makes obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and peoples
3567830 a new brain for barack obama its 78 years old ed note its 80 years old and it still works perfectly it belongs to zbigniew brzezinski the peppery ex national security adviser to jimmy carter
3567831 they operate not by arguing but by slandering vilifying demonising they very promptly wheel out anti semitism there is an element of paranoia in this inclination to view any serious attempt at a compromised peace as somehow directed against israel

3567857 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
3567858 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military

3567925 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3567926 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3567927 people wont come back unless there are jobs for them while companies arent going to move here unless there are people to work for them
3567928 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day
3567929 unfortunately this is a state program and i simply cant get rid of all the bureaucracy
3567930 but i can streamline the processes and tighten deadlines to make the program run faster
3567931 this will not be a city of half a million people again for a very long time for new orleans the best way forward is to let go of the past and look to a different future

3567940 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3567941 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3567942 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3567943 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3567944 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3567945 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point

3567960 tuan guru abdul hadi menegaskan dalam ucapannya bahawa kita bukan perkauman tetapi menjadi tanggungjawab parti untuk mempertahankan dasar islam
3567961 beliau juga menegaskan bahawa setelah 50 tahun orang melayu memerintah negara ini tetapi jika orang bukan melayu mengambilalih maka ia sukar kepada negara dan rakyat
3567962 oleh itu kata tuan guru lagi jika ahli parlimen bukan islam lebih ramai ia akan menggugat orang islam
3567963 sebagai orang islam kita perlu bersikap adil memberi penjelasan kepada mereka isu timbul apabila penjelasan itu timbul daripada pihak yang tidak layak seperti sisters in islam
3567964 jadi bagaimana mereka akan dapat penjelasan yang sebenarnya tentang islam
3567965 pihak bertanggung jawab seperti jakim dan jabatan perdana menteri perlu menguraikan kekusutan tentang pentakrifan dalam istilah perlembagaan kepada bukan islam
3567966 umat islam akan melihat isu tersebut berkenaan akan melibatkan hak umat islam untuk memastikan undang undang islam tidak dicabar
3567967 jadi dengan kerangka undang undang yang telah termaktub dalam perkara 121 1a dalam perlembagaan persekutuan itu berkaitan bidangkuasa mahkamah syariah kenapa pihak pihak yang berkenaan perlu mengadakan perbahasan terbuka yang mempersoal bidangkuasa ini
3567968 jika tidak perbahasan terbuka itu dilihat bertujuan untuk mengkritik undang undang islam dan memaksakan udang undang sivil mendominasi undang undang islam apakah pihak penganjur forum itu boleh berfikir mereka mempunyai tujuan lain dan ia boleh dipercayai oleh umat islam
3567969 saya bimbang berlaku provokasi sehingga mencetuskan perkara yang tidak diingini
3567970 kita dicabar di bawah perkara 121 a mereka tahu undang undang tetapi mahu mencabar agama islam
3567971 kalau mereka hendak tahu tentang islam mereka boleh jumpa pegawai jakim jabatan kemajuan islam malaysia
3567972 mana mana pihak pada masa akan datang yang mahu membincangkan isu isu sensitif cara terbaik adalah melalui pertemuan tertutup

3568091 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3568092 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims

3568094 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3568095 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3568096 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security

3568119 i saw him when i walked in and he was pretty sore and said he thought could get loose
3568120 i walked back there a little later and he was still fighting it pretty good so theres no sense in pushing it

3568130 the four components of reality god life matter and time
3568131 were just a group of people who come together to celebrate our shared beliefs just like any other group of worshippers frankly i think its ridiculous that any such group should get special status but those are the rules and were happy to live by the rules

3568146 seeing as im the god of the old testament lets do it the way i made adam
3568147 who is this imposter who claims to have created man
3568148 it occurred to me that if they called themselves a church and really how is swinging any more bizarre as a spiritual ritual than symbolic cannibalism they could not only skirt the law that shut them down but also get a whopping tax exemption the hosts house would become both church and rectory and would therefore be exempt from all property tax

3568156 were talking about road building were talking about schools were talking about decisions on how to use tax dollars on police parks or health care or firefighters
3568157 the ones that are sitting in court that dont belong there that are judging they need to be out and new faces in who will do the job
3568158 even though my children are grown i do have four grandchildren its very important for them growing up whats going on with their education
3568159 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3568160 i consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever
3568161 we were really concerned they were missing out on some quality learning time especially since the first two hours are the literacy block

3568163 the tour de lain isnt a major stage race but there are some strong teams here and lots of riders who rode the tour de france we came with a motivated and on form team and the riders proved it with how they dominated things tony was great rabon did really well and im really happy for linus
3568164 his crash in tirreno adriatico could have ended his career but hes worked hard and made a fantastic recovery winning has really boosted his moral and motivated him for the tour of germany at the end of the month
3568165 its an up and down stage and so it wont be easy to control things

3568169 the whole point of going to the movies in the first place is to be overwhelmed
3568170 the most important element of summer blockbuster culture isnt the selling of movies its the selling of anticipation
3568171 look lenore its there if its a 9 11 tribute tattoo well now youre really patriotic good for you
3568172 hey hooker you totally want to fuck jacob you totally want him hahahahahaha
3568173 ive been fed apple juice i think theyre on to me i feel like everybody has been involved in this i dont even remember inviting the orange juice tim is the one whos been giving this juice to me
3568174 how many people are involved in this i feel like everybody is i can chop my fields of vision you shouldnt be recording but theres nobody else i can trust theres more going on on this plane than you think there is serious shit too
3568175 we just have to put it all together later for instance these cookies shaking them i was saving them for you after the last rotation you were wearing pink youve made at least four rotations each time you had to talk to the higher level people the ones who make the decisions thats how i got the juice
3568176 im trying to make eye contact had it for a second its not working the way its supposed t there are rules that are not being followed were supposed to be preparing for something big do you think shell come back with that orange juice again
3568177 every time youre doing whatever it is that youre doing things around us undergo serious changes
3568178 my son asked me for a medal but he didnt ask for a particular one
3568179 there are a lot of middle aged women and men who have contacted me or stopped me in the street and they have told me that i am an inspiration to them
3568180 without the support of my family i would not have made a new challenge i stood on the tatami mat with the same feeling as one of the mothers out there
3568181 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3568182 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3568183 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3568184 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3568185 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3568186 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3568187 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage

3568194 i like showmanship because it is more of a challenge for me and its just not all about the goat
3568195 she had the proper positioning and did so with great ease throughout
3568196 not only does the appearance of the goat need to be neat tidy and looking good but so does the appearance of the exhibitors
3568197 the commonwealth was transferring expenses for these programs that they mandate to localities and i disagree with that
3568198 it points the finger back at the state for having given us mandates but not giving us funding for us and then demanding money back
3568199 they state government can get into a habit of increasing mandates and decreasing funding for those mandates and we cant afford that
3568200 none of the options available to local governments are good options
3568201 i worked for hallmark cards in kansas city missouri as a greeting card artist
3568202 you all of a sudden see a group of children that will run up to my mural and hug it and start kissing it because they think its realistic
3568203 a lot of my inspiration and painting came from down there
3568204 on the ships i usually work from midnight until 9 in the morning when the guests are asleep
3568205 unless theres scaffolding when we climb 200 feet in the air
3568206 it makes me feel good that someone would appreciate my work and enjoy it
3568207 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
3568208 its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
3568209 this is the only one where african americans have even enough courage to stand up and run
3568210 i think theyre saying that with those nine seats cant we just have one
3568211 i was at this event where she said that she didnt think this other guy steve cohen was gonna win because the constituents werent gonna support somebody who doesnt accept jesus as his lord and savior
3568212 everyones jaw kind of dropped and certainly we didnt write her a check
3568213 for instance the dust up got so much attention that barack obama in his role as the new leader of the democratic party weighed in with a statement today even though presidential nominees almost never dirty their hands in local primaries
3568214 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive emilys list does not condone or support these types of attacks
3568215 netease has been a leader in the chinese game market and we look forward to working with them to deliver high quality entertainment to chinese gamers

3568217 were excited to be partnering with blizzard entertainment to bring starcraft ii and battle net to china we hope to combine blizzard entertainments expertise in developing world class games with neteases strength in online game operation in china to bring the best gaming experiences to our players
3568218 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3568219 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3568220 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3568221 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3568222 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3568223 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3568224 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3568225 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3568226 powering a childrens ride at the state fair with biogas is a celebration of the great efforts of californias dairy farmers to help us meet our energy needs
3568227 were proud to partner with these innovative dairy farmers and demonstrate the potential for the states agriculture and power sectors to work together to meet californias climate goals
3568228 jeff portnoy takes things to a whole new level portnoy has made a career out of fart movies
3568229 ive done some gross out movies myself but portnoy is at the next level above in terms of dominating the world of farts
3568230 portnoy is trying to branch out and get a little more legit
3568231 you get to watch portnoy going cold turkey jack naturally did it in a very entertaining way but he also made it very believable being able to strike that balance is tough but jack totally committed to it
3568232 what i dont get it delayed reaction oh laughs way funny
3568233 this is cool but here are my thoughts maybe we should add this

3568337 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3568338 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3568339 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3568340 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3568341 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3568342 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3568343 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3568344 the states and the ftc have limited resources but this problem is getting worse over time
3568345 this is a huge threat to consumers and the future of online commerce
3568346 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3568347 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3568348 i would like for them to be cautious and make sure they wont fall into north koreas trap

3568356 three years ago i advertised for the truman button in the independence missouri newspaper
3568357 thats where truman began his career i got no response then just two weeks ago i got a call a woman who owned the button had died and her children had found my ad clipping in the drawer where she had left it

3568367 i now can have a life without the fear and shame that surrounds the abuse that we victims have gone through

3568375 it is a very logical thing to do and hopefully it will assuage concerns of leading players and make up their minds to come here
3568376 to ensure the continuation and proliferation of responsible behavioral targeting practices we are supportive of efforts to establish
3568377 our guess is that the banks projections will show inflation moving back to target in the medium term but possibly with upside risks
3568378 the bank will probably hint that rates can come down but not yet
3568379 the performance of our new zealand and australian businesses and formicas operations in asia and europe has been very pleasing while the delay in capturing the operational improvements identified prior to formicas acquisition has been disappointing we are still confident that we will achieve a significantly improved operating performance in formicas usa operations

3568391 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3568392 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3568393 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures

3568397 we cant turn out a my fair lady type hit
3568398 the most popular and subsequently the most financially successful form of theatre in australia must be the musical comedy
3568399 since the beginning of this 20th century this country has produced or imported world class presentations of the best and sometimes best forgotten musicals from broadway and the west end
3568400 its not a matter of looking at the back of the financial times to see if this is the right time to put on a musical
3568401 it was only a matter of time before popular song culture found its way back to the theatre
3568402 there are people out there who want to create there will always be room for lerner and loewe and rodgers and hammerstein they are masterpieces of the genre
3568403 i think the genres popularity will come in waves its survival of the fittest in a way i would like to think it will continue that we are able to not only give pleasure to a lot of people but we can be a major employer of talent
3568404 those sorts of shows do attract a wider audience and for us to go to canberra is also a chance to fly the flag so to speak
3568405 revivals of shows like my fair lady will attract audiences but they are really costly to stage ive hear that for opera australia this is the biggest budget theyve ever had for a show
3568406 if you stage a blockbuster in canberra audiences will come
3568407 most of the time people are coming to leave their cares and troubles at the door
3568408 you want to feel good at the end a new show has to have a really good story likeable characters and enough of the conventions of musical theatre for it to work the biggest criticisms you get of new shows is well it was okay but there were no shows that i came out humming at the end thats why lloyd webber is very smart because he uses the same bits of music again and again
3568409 spamalot just didnt work here at all and it wasnt that the cast wasnt good its all about context in london it was laugh a minute here there were a few funny moments
3568410 its kind of built into the broadway thinking these days if somethings being revived does it have a life in the movies
3568411 mamma mia s been a really good example its getting back to that really old attitude of the 1940s and 50s when it wasnt musical theatre stars who necessarily played the lead role it was kind of the star of the day pierce brosnan can hardly hold a note but he kind of worked in that role in mamma mia
3568412 so thats provided an interesting spin on a traditional musical and bringing it to a new audience and also unearthing new talent
3568413 but at the moment if you looked at whats on in london its pretty much revivals shows that we know and love and jukebox musicals songs we used to have sex to now with a loose story attached to them
3568414 producing big blockbuster west end style musicals on a first run is always destined for failure new west end and new broadway shows start small and then they build youve got people like eddie perfect who is now writing shane warne the musical the way that started was kind of in the corner of melbourne pubs and little cabaret venues theres more out there
3568415 on the heywire site now you can see videos you can listen to audio and you can read words that have come from young people across regional and rural australia
3568416 if youre a young person you can network with other young people from your area or from other areas across rural and regional australia and share your thoughts ideas aspirations anything really to do with your life
3568417 its a forum for any form of discussion and sometimes people put up posts or comment on the blog article of the day
3568418 but really its a space to create discuss debate and be yourself
3568419 heywire tries to restore the balance and say to young people we actually care about what you have to say what your thoughts and ideas are about the world what your story is and who you are
3568420 thank you for your email im currently away from the office if your request is urgent please call random phone number
3568421 maybe you havent heard but this is the year of freedom
3568422 first there was the ron paul revolution in which an avuncular 10 term
3568423 now theres the libertarian party which sold a little bit of its hard line liberty loving soul in exchange for the most respectable candidate it has ever had recently converted former republican congressman bob barr whos polling nationally near 6 and could conceivably naderize john mccain in a few key states and help nudge the presidency to barack obama
3568424 since 2000 libertarian candidates have peeled off enough votes from republican congressional candidates to cost the party races in washington nevada montana and most recently louisiana
3568425 the central goal of libertarianism is hard to disagree with freedom defining it is another matter party members ive met often speak of freedom as if it were a phantom limb youre born with it but it gets taken from you by the bureaucratic violence of the epa the atf the doe the dea the u n nclb nafta and above all the irs freedoms restoration is the magic moment when the nanny state melts away and you can see the life you were supposed to live before the tax auditors and environmental regulators and drug warriors all came to rope brand and pen you in for life with their endless rulemaking and intrusions
3568426 this sense that progress has gone too far and too fast unites a large swath of libertarians from coast to coast
3568427 v oters alienated by our calcified party system may find in the libertarians a party thats armed to the teeth but with a gentle logic and a contagious enthusiasm for freedom in all its forms libertarians are getting ready for the mainstream and mainstream america may finally be ready for them

3568429 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting
3568430 the problem that surfaced today is not related to exploitation of a security issue on esx
3568431 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem through committed action and vigorous enforcement they can provide a powerful and much needed deterrent
3568432 these numbers are startling but they may even understate the problem
3568433 i often say frontliners in any organisation play important roles of making tourists welcome comfortable and enjoy their holidays in our beautiful state
3568434 this includes frontliners in the mosques like having their own tourist guides who must also greet tourists in a friendly manner and make them at ease and comfortable when they tour the mosques
3568435 the muslim community knows that cleanliness is part of our faith in islam and if the cleanliness level in the mosque is not maintained then i fear tourists especially from foreign countries would perceive our religion in a wrong way
3568436 not only the inside of the mosque must be clean but the toilets also must be dirt free and functional we do not want to portray a negative image to tourists who may relate their experience to their friends or family members
3568437 i never do well on those genetics test doing well this time is probably a one off
3568438 when she doesnt get her way shes a right stroppy cow
3568439 her craving for pleasure was so strong that it was the one stay of her nature
3568440 a strange glittering night flower odor yielding insect drawing insect infested rose of pleasure
3568441 however it would depend on the government budget and steps must be taken to ensure that the environment was unharmed
3568442 we hope that such a situation prevails from our observation the armed forces are seen to be efficient in handling operations particularly freeing hostages in any situation
3568443 although i am retiring from the times i am not actually retiring i will be an independent financial adviser offering advice on a fee only basis and will have an office in downtown st petersburg

3568445 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3568446 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3568447 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3568448 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3568449 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3568450 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3568451 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3568452 so ill be expecting a lot from you this semester
3568453 we realized communications professionals like you are where a lot of citizens learn about economics and economic policy
3568454 the news is going to report that things have turned down
3568455 an ever evolving global network of 3 000 emerging creatives
3568456 before being able to understand the ways in the sic 4cs sic converge it is imperative to understand the zeitgeist of the c we know best culture we live it we breathe sic and we create it
3568457 those customs and artefacts which are shared and the sharing of which brings social cohesion
3568458 all intellectual emotional and behavioural features that are transmitted through learning and social interaction rather than through genetic endowment
3568459 the literary artistic and philosophical inheritance that has been taught in departments of humanities both in europe and america and which has recently been subject to contemptuous dismissal especially in america as the product of dead white european males
3568460 mine is a nor mative use of the word im using it to identify those things that are about knowledge in the realm of the human heart
3568461 we have an enormous accumulation of technical know how and scientific knowledge but we are very thin on practical knowledge what to do and how to feel the loss of a culture means the loss of that knowledge and thats what i think we are advancing towards there is a highly sophisticated grasp of all kinds of technical know how and the science that estab lishes it but little sense of how the human being finds fulfilment in those things or where to look for it
3568462 there are two important factors that are causing this to happen to us the first is mass communications which flood all the channels in which culture might grow with a stream of endless noise so that it becomes difficult to separate out things that are worth attending to from things that are not that combined with the democratisation of everything means the type of criticism that is vital for separating out the valuable from the trivial becomes very difficult to maintain thats the principal thing we have lost through the egalitarian reforms in education and through current political correctness
3568463 has any eastern culture paid to western culture the kind of tribute that benjamin britten paid in curlew river to the culture of japan or rudyard kipling in kim to the culture of india
3568464 we can understand the chinese through the confucian odes in a way that we cant understand foot binding the great thing about high culture is that its open to interpretation from outside itself by its very nature it is an attempt to communicate with mankind as such
3568465 there is always that pressure downwards we all get tired and we all need to flop down in front of a rerun of frasier we dont necessarily want a high intellectual conversation
3568466 look at london its buzzing with high culture its very healthy
3568467 my sense of high culture is that its whatever culture happens to be enjoyed by the elite its a term with a hidden political content that opens the way for culture to further political ends so the elite can say we are the possessors of this and we feel it is good for you and we have the right to educate you and mould your taste taste is often a very politicised thing
3568468 its what i care about and wish to make a case for i wouldnt necessarily claim that because i like it it is in some way high my own taste is fairly mixed and would include certain things that are considered high culture and others that are not
3568469 if we are talking about what might be good music or bad music then i am very happy to allow value judgment and expertise i will listen more to somebody who cares deeply about and has made a study of the subject than to somebody who hasnt the reason i bristle at the notion of high culture is that it seems to bring with it something that is purely political
3568470 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3568471 whether they want to say it publicly or not is another thing
3568472 a certain element of australians being a bit leery of criticising homegrown product and i think that goes across the arts
3568473 i cant understand critics defending bands such as the vines or silverchair because in the rest of the world these bands are seen as complete jokes i can understand them selling lots of records though because there isnt any criticism of them here
3568474 it is quite simply impossible to take your eyes off him
3568475 woodley is wonderfully funny peeking out of character he creates a rapport with his audience that makes
3568476 more used to dealing with wool at the production end we had about 2000 merino breeders dad was always trying to improve the stock
3568477 its too late to apologise its too late i said its too late to apologise its too late whoa whoa
3568478 timbaland will not be appearing this month in australia but he looks forward to performing for his australian fans in the near future
3568479 the more you know the less you know its all about digital narcissism shameless self promotion i find it offensive
3568480 typically do not add to the available stock of commentary they are purely parasitic on the stories and opinions that traditional media provide
3568481 claustrophobic environment appealing chiefly to a certain kind of aggressive point scoring male and utterly off putting to everyone else
3568482 letting regular people participate in what was previously the domain of the few
3568483 but its a small sample some politicians resist this but saying its a bad thing wont stop it happening
3568484 knowledge and expertise are local and the x hundreds of thousands or millions of bloggers will know more in detail on each and every subject than the 500 or 1 000 who work for a media organisation theres thus something of a pressure on that smaller number to raise their game all to the good of course
3568485 much better than some overambitious failure not that people shouldnt be ambitious but i dont like those efforts to be contemporary by people who really dont understand what it means
3568486 theyre always struggling with these 18th century rules and having endless arguments
3568487 at the tate theres a chairman who runs the meeting and gets things done
3568488 it was incredibly bohemian nobody has been bohemian like that since the early 1970s the art world today is definitely not bohemian and there were all these people being gently rude to each other in that english way
3568489 a clear view of the ra and what it should be he has a sense of it being grand with grand spaces and a grand scale and he has been committed to international contemporary art hes a very hard act to follow
3568490 i identified with that tedium very deeply and very profoundly he was a forerunner in the idea of non communication between people especially couples it was the same with bergman they both dealt with that not only the silence of it but the pain of it
3568491 but the difference is that bergman slept with them and i dont that is a difference a palpable difference
3568492 its very difficult to make a movie anywhere in europe now there is a general crisis of creation everywhere french cinema now cant be compared with the nouvelle vague period british movies with free cinema and italian movies with neo realism
3568493 its a general crisis but in america its perhaps not a crisis in terms of creativity but in terms of quality the quality of films being made there is simply not comparable to those before the 1960s i think us cinema has become subjugated to what they see as the target audience this is more than just a juvenile audience i think its become infantile more and more these films seem like childrens electronic toys like nintendo the sense of danger that was present in films before 1970 has been lost
3568494 i have been formed as much by the american classical canon as by the european classical canon
3568495 we lived in very different periods but of course we belong to the same family the ghost of religion is much more present in bunuels films than in mine but there is a good reason for this mainly because religion was far more rooted in his society than it is in mine
3568496 one of the things it is important to realise is that the franco regime was called national catholicism the nation was united with catholicism religion was a great enemy of the people and of liberty so bunuel had to fight it very actively that phantom is receding by the time i started making films
3568497 i admire very much their practical catholicism they dont pay any attenton to the pope and they dont think about god they did it in a very personal way there is a sense of idolatory which the papacy doesnt really like spanish people believe in images they relate their images to their own lives its a very practical application of religion
3568498 it is part of the relationship some spanish have with death i would like to have that in my own life they think about death in a very natural way its part of living the dead people dont seem to be completely dead at all
3568499 i love that series but i havent seen the film yet
3568500 ever since i was a teenager it was very clear in my mind that i was off to madrid i didnt belong to the world in which i had grown up i knew that i wasnt going to develop in this small town for me madrid was freedom i could be anonymous i became a hippie the moment i arrived
3568501 its been an evolution a very natural response to the passing of time not something ive consciously decided if id made a conscious decision id probably have gone for a style that was lighter its given my work a new gravity a new profundity my life is weightier than it was before everything that is good for my films is bad for my life but anyway i cant avoid it
3568502 im very aware of the fact of being aged of all the limitations and im much more conscious about time it has to do with the preoccupation with death but not just with death itself its about reaching the end of things about things reaching their natural end about limitations it is very close to me every day its a very real sensation for me it doesnt mean plenitude or satisfaction its very unsatisfactory but im living it constantly
3568503 i dont as a rule do cinema as therapy but there are minor exceptions the great issue for me at the moment is death especially after the death of my mother and in volver i am very clearly dealing with that trying to have some sort of reconciliation with death because i find it hard to live with volver was my attempt to do that
3568504 i was very involved with the play in the early stages when daniel sparrow the producer first approached me and we had to find a writer but then i had little to do with it i wanted them to have the freedom to realise it in any way they wanted its very strange for me the way these characters are alive on stage in a different language and a different culture and in a different medium i felt very strange the first time i saw it the second time i felt better
3568505 they found it was good material for the stage and the movie is about women in the theatre the theatre is a protagonist many sequences in the film happen on the stage or around the stage its about women and actresses and women who have the capacity to be actresses
3568506 you have to listen to the audience breathe how they sound you can feel if they are hooked by the plot my impressions is they were following it they were very very hooked
3568507 the more you become what you have dreamed for yourself the more authentic you are
3568508 it works very well for that character but i cant say it works for everyone some things you dream may be crazy or a lie its not something you can apply to humanity in general it functions in a repressed society where you have to hide part of your identity
3568509 has forever been the victim of the nostalgia of others we arrived too late the generation before us told us then and have been telling us ever since
3568510 the shape of contemporary america was born in the crucible of the 1970s
3568511 must look at the range of options and avoid burdening future generations with the cost of maintaining unsustainable defences we have to develop responses that are appropriate to the area at risk and wherever possible achieve sustainability through working with rather than against coastal processes
3568512 over the breast of the spring the land amid cities amid lanes
3568513 and see the vast emptiness of the midwest and you understand why henry ford said he had to invent the gasoline buggy in order to escape the tedium of life on the farm
3568514 with your arm around your sweet one in your oldsmobile barrellin down the boulevard youre lookin for the heart of saturday night
3568515 his daughter gloredhel wedded haldir son of halmir lord of the men of brethil and at the same feast his son galdor the tall wedded hareth the daughter of halmir
3568516 actually murdoch and tolkien had this in common though they could hardly be more different in other respects like murdoch tolkien did not worry about
3568517 between 1980 and 2000 classical music more or less disappeared from american network television magazines and other mainstream media its products deemed too elitist effete or esoteric for the world of pop
3568518 there are a certain very few things sic in this world that keep me alive almost compel me to live just by popping into my mind at the very last moment in spite of the most unbelievable suffering that i cannot put into words the poetry of wallace stevens is one of these things
3568519 tension are you kidding this is my first time on the red carpet i never saw a red carpet like that before this is official ive only been in competition two or three times
3568520 i had to buy a bow tie theres something about that moment going up those steps every time you do something like that its a key event in america it would be the oscars or something actually id been rejected maybe four times by cannes natural born killers won the prize here that was my last experience of festival politics after that i never came back
3568521 i got off on the wrong foot in that first scene that has snakes in the bed people were taken aback by that thats not going to go down in ohio
3568522 my whole life ive been fascinated by history i love the past i loved doing nixon going back to my you and alexanders mind he was the proto original to me nobody had thought of organising the world alexander was the first westerner who really went to the east he didnt come back with the loot he stayed he became eastern its the ultimate merging of the two its the world order the world government concept
3568523 its a classic movie thing isnt it hitchcock did that you know whats going to happen but you have to make it suspenseful and exciting along the way even if you know whether the men are going to live or die i was powered along in united 93 though i did know it wasnt going to end well i wanted to know more
3568524 we dont know what happened really we never investigated it they spent more money investigating bill clintons blow job than they did 9 11
3568525 historical issues have dogged me my whole life i loved history in school ive studied and read so much history i think i have a grasp of what its like and oliver stone did not invent the mixture of fact and fiction thats the accusation my detractors make jfk was based on years of reading
3568526 i know where youre going with that one im not the kind of person who has illusions about american innocence but it is the american style to reinvent to renew optimism and that is often confused with patriotism patriotism for me invokes conflicting feelings so many patriots are really rascals you know last refuge of the scoundrel nationality is a dangerous thing but i believe in the ability of man and woman to overcome
3568527 if you look at the late 1990s when america was prospering so much economically we drifted back into that easy militarism again you look at all the invasions that happened from 1989 even the day born on the fourth of july came out we invaded panama it killed our business
3568528 then there was private ryan a wonderful film but promoting the concept of the greatest generation and then that gave way to this shock and awe i mean i loved black hawk down but they must have made that film with pentagon approval they couldnt have got those helicopters although the film was about losing the men were so perfectly trained they were robotic in battle the cartoonish thing keeps coming back then we actually go to war black hawk down was a precursor to iraq 2 it was as if the merger between entertainment and war had been achieved at last
3568529 everything i had tried to achieve through platoon and born on the fourth of july it was as if there was no memory of those films any more gone
3568530 that whole period 2002 03 04 that was so sad even the new york liberal intelligentsia wanted to go to war the senate voted for it the stampede towards war was evident from 2001 and i did alexander at that point because whatever they say it got me out of that world i dropped out for three years and i survived
3568531 people in movies identify with the close ups thats still the magic that happens the biggest issues in the world mean nothing if you cant illustrate them with people
3568532 they go to the edge of physical exhaustion and death they see death they help each other they communicate without seeing each other and they both have very strong ties to their families and their children it is that spiritual loving side that plays a big role in keeping them alive
3568533 my hope is that through them you remember that long after the movie is finished you feel the pain of all suffering its not just 9 11 its that situation its what you do to stay alive what does a man or woman do when stuck on a rock face people respond differently to disaster thats what interested me in the second and third acts im trying to reach for that
3568534 stephen gaghan with syriana and the recent work of george clooney theyre a new generation id only do something if i could really bring some fierce light to bear i dont want to be just another light bulb in the room im interested in the cracks in the dark rocks
3568535 let the reader decide let the reader beware good luck
3568536 i was a college student and by the time i got to page 80 of gravitys rainbow i was hooked
3568537 i knew what i wanted to do with the rest of my life
3568538 he is like the puritans living in the howling wilderness of new england asking who are we
3568539 a humongous bloated jigsaw puzzle of a story pretentious without being provocative elliptical without being illuminating complicated without being rewardingly complex
3568540 is faced with a huge amount of pressure to plan a career early on in life many of my friends at university are simply getting a degree as a stepping stone to work in the city
3568541 i hear stories of how they campaigned against war government for freedom of speech etc no one my age seems to believe that what they do will have any impact on how the world is run
3568542 because i worked in a merchant bank and was able to buy a two bedroom house in wimbledon that house today would cost 350 400k if one of my children wanted to buy that house they would need to be earning 80 100k even a one bedroom flat is way beyond their means
3568543 im paying off someone elses mortgage when i could be saving for my own
3568544 which means the booming housing market is great for us but not for the children weve already decided we will have to help them out when theyre nearer to being in a position to buy somewhere as we dont have lots of savings well need to take equity from the house were very lucky that even when things got really bad financially when the children were small we managed to pay the mortgage i know people who had to sell their houses to pay off debts
3568545 its funny getting to middle age and losing what youd never valued previously i was hardly ever ill and overnight i became this sick person i try not to let it get me down as i dont want to be defined by my poor health but i often get very tired and worried about how things will work out for them all
3568546 its always those who have had privilege that wish in their twisted sense of egalitarianism to seek to deny others and this is particularly relevant to post baby boomer education for the majority
3568547 if i go to university ill take a great life experience away with me and a chance of getting a better job in turn allowing me to save for a house a lot quicker and easier
3568548 we were all so much more detached from our parents
3568549 did not help with homework or take much interest in our education as they generally believed the schools were doing a good job or they themselves hadnt been educated to the same standard we were
3568550 working through the chain the capital gains of the house owners are transfers from first time buyers the political appeal of this situation is easy to grasp the burden of rising house prices falls on current and future first time buyers
3568551 to differentiate yourself and get a job requires further education which costs time and money with the outcome that you ironically end up working for some lucky git who went into work straight after university and is less qualified than you but has more work experience
3568552 we have had a period of gradual incremental change following the shocks of the world wars in the first half of the century
3568553 but now new shocks are in sight climate change ageing energy depletion globalisation immigration runaway technology and maybe nuclear war these cannot be dealt with by the means of changing prices which is the current economic orthodoxy i think we know what to do but we dont have the willpower to do it
3568554 the present young are known as generation internship because they cant get paid jobs in 1970 a 30 year old was earning 15 less than a 50 year old now the gap is 40
3568555 a comprehensive view of the legislative picture with regard to any potential negative effect on the needs and rights of future generations together with the means to prevent such legislation from taking place
3568556 how can the old seize everything the young will rebel theyll simply go on strike
3568557 im an optimist i think we can rise to this challenge what it requires is a different way of thinking of making policies that take account of the future the question of whether we can appeal to anything above the selfish gene but im not a reductionist i do think theres more to life than the selfish gene
3568558 government and society is an inter generational contract and one task of government is to maintain that contract so that no one generation exploits the others
3568559 there are several things we are working on a regulatory regime for utilities that rewards and encourages investment a simpler more attractive savings vehicle to make it easier for young people to get started with saving
3568560 that would mean present generations would impoverish themselves for the future he did it to make the climate change figures look big
3568561 the official debt is not really the measure of anything
3568562 you have to look at something fundamental which is the generational imbalance i realised we were flying blind we had no idea what our true generational policy was we were looking at numbers that had no clothes youre probably familiar with the emperors new clothes story in current economics every single institution is looking at the wrong numbers routinely
3568563 i think certainly the elderly as a group when it comes to election day have nothing to do but vote you know theyre not working so theyre a group that gets a lot of attention from politicians and are well organised because they have nothing to do but organise
3568564 contracting for the future is difficult for example consumer choice finds it difficult to cope with providing support for everyones old age the time gap between consumer decisions and their consequences is just too long it is up to politicians to craft durable commitments for inter generational transfer
3568565 there is no quality in human nature which causes more fatal errors in our conduct than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote
3568566 cognitive occupational and material men and women have had to choose and they have often chosen the shorter view in particular they appear to have given a lower priority to the longest of horizons that which transcends the individual and extends beyond him and into the future by means of his or her children
3568567 and i dont like this notion of sacrifice if im overspending on my credit card and someone tells me to cut back can i say that is sacrifice
3568568 you want to wave a wand and tell your children it will be fine that they will manage but you know its going to be really really tough
3568569 we live in a very narrow minded and decidedly selfish society we ought to seek to succeed where our parents have failed but instead we have become cynical about it
3568570 before me most blogs were very first person like online diaries i woke up today i had tea with my neighbour i went for a walk in the park blah blah blah boring i didnt want to talk about myself i wanted to talk about celebrities and entertainment because theyre craaaaazzzzeee and theyre so much fun
3568571 i worked nonstop for a week i almost had a nervous breakdown
3568572 you must make a lot of money out of this
3568573 i was basically just a struggling actress trying to find any outlet to act rather than be a waitress or work in a nine to five job
3568574 we never faked anything we never had fake punch lines it was always really offbeat or odd but it wasnt fake on the web it works better if its not slick and polished like tv people like me real and raw
3568575 i always wanted to do television thats why i wanted to be an actress but ill absolutely never stop video blogging i dont think id even stop for a while its a total addiction
3568576 who havent spoken to their grandparents or their grandparents are dead they seem to see me as a grandparent with whom they can converse
3568577 i wanted to make sure people knew i was old geriatric was the first word that came into my mind and 1927 indicated the date of my birth i was trying to be upfront about everything
3568578 i dont have to answer them all but if you were to read them you couldnt not answer them they pour out their hearts to me
3568579 in less than five minutes i was online to the world
3568580 how come the highest technology is always used for the lowest purposes
3568581 attention isnt quite that visceral but its going to be a strong force in the future
3568582 todays college students are more likely to have a feeling of self importance to be entitled and in general to be more narcissistic
3568583 about two thirds of current college students score above average on narcissism and thats 30 more than in 1982
3568584 that all it is is self promotion theres nothing behind it at all they are successful at doing self promotion and that is all theres a new oligarchy of self promotion

3568590 am i more important than any other robert in the world
3568591 i dont think so but on the internet i am more important
3568592 is that this medium unlike past mediums lets you listen to customers to have a two way conversation business people arent really adept at doing that
3568593 everybody has access to distribution theres no scarcity any more journalists have access to printing presses now everybody has access to youtube or they can blog twenty years ago the hard thing was to convince a committee publishers newspapers to distribute your ideas now i dont need to do that the only scarcity today is audience attention how do you get an audience to pay attention to you
3568594 the more power you give to individuals as opposed to institutions the better things are likely to get giving people tools to shape their own lives is likely to make them feel and behave better
3568595 the human courage to lead people where the crowd is not heading
3568596 it was sort of like a scavenger hunt you go door to door with some friends you trade things for something bigger or better
3568597 i expected it would be fun enough to keep going until i got to a house but i never expected people would want to hear about it
3568598 the red paperclip is famous not me when i walk down the street its not like people know who i am but when they talk to me they know i have a famous icebreaker conversation
3568599 it kinda scares me this vision of sitting in front of a computer all day
3568600 yes you you control the information age welcome to your world
3568601 in 2006 the world wide web became a tool for bringing together the small contributions of millions of people and making them matter
3568602 er john didnt you have some pressing business somewhere else
3568603 not seen as a powerful central department unfocused and incoherent how long will odpm be around not yet gelled as department bureaucratic too much emphasis on corporate building confusing interesting uncertain
3568604 name lack of understanding in whitehall about what it does lack of clearly articulated vision and leadership lack of internal cohesion feeling of transience re organisation fatigue antiquated financial management and hr human resources policies current objectives often seen as warm words but nothing more a perceived lack of clarity about practical issues schizophrenic about devolution of responsibilities duplication of work wasted resources
3568605 people wouldnt have a clue who odpm are apart from the link with john prescott
3568606 all sorts of bits that straddle government and how they relate to one another is beyond me
3568607 i dont want to take part in this survey the only people in government i deal with are the seu and theyre in the home office arent they
3568608 if they keep piling on the initiatives then moving on becomes unmanageable and people end up ignoring them
3568609 was created as a central department in may 2002 we have around 6 500 staff including 1 800 in our four agencies and 2 700 in the nine government offices for the regions our annual expenditure is 50 billion
3568610 prescott had done a deal with blair that after one parliament at detr he would have his own department at the cabinet office now blair honoured that bargain the cabinet office had been the graveyard for a string of ministerial careers david clark jack cunningham and mo mowlam but prescott passionately wanted a role at the heart of government as blairs delivery chaser blair deliberately omitted to tell prescott when they met in sedgefield that he was going to dismantle the department of the environment transport and the regions that had been created for him blair had been thinking long and hard about how he could get a grip on the transport issue which was continuing to cause problems for the government
3568611 in delivering key manifesto pledges and in matters of current importance dealing with cross department issues including social exclusion devolution regional governance
3568612 between policy delivery and government odpm credit where credit is due

3568620 we shouldnt draw any conclusions from this 3 months of decreased defaults he said

3568632 the new generation of national cf activists are so careerist its frightening fortunately the organisation retains a certain charm below the national level and it is here where some of our best activists operate indeed i would say the three most talented people i have met in the organisation have never been involved beyond branch level

3568635 this may be a tough year for jeffco and other metro school districts to be asking for money
3568636 youre reaching into a base of voters who dont necessarily have as much information who may be inclined to just give more money to schools because it sounds like the right thing to do
3568637 most studies show theres no connection between how much is spent and what the results are as far as student tests
3568638 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year
3568639 confirmation of george storeys identification was made using dna together with compelling historical research
3568640 it has been a long arduous process but now pte storeys place of burial is known to his country and most importantly his family

3568645 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3568646 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3568647 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september
3568648 the result from telstra has hurt the market a little bit
3568649 i didnt think it was that bad but it was just the outlook

3568670 after a while you can only write down so far
3568671 the natural bottom is around zero and were rapidly approaching that point
3568672 a one month upswing is good news but well need to keep our eyes on this
3568673 if we see the new housing market start to stabilize nationally thats a good sign that the used home market will stabilize as well
3568674 three to four consecutive months of pending sales increases would really a signal a difference in the market

3568681 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3568682 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3568683 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3568684 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3568685 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3568686 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
3568687 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today
3568688 he medvedev has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the soviet union of the 1950s had over the soviet union nobody can even remember his name
3568689 what weve seen over the last two or three years is more districts getting involved in fiscal situations or problems
3568690 hopefully were going to get to the point where we wont have these kinds of things happening
3568691 these are situations where weve had mismanagement in terms of oversight and basically the board not playing close attention to what was going on and as evidence by some of the factors included also the superintendent not paying close attention
3568692 are you confident that as the new school year approaches some of these districts on the list will do what it takes to get where they need to be
3568693 we sure hope so were going to work with them in every way we can to ensure that

3568695 i think we would have been able to help him avoid that situation when we know were having a visitor especially a high profile event were having in the store we always arrange for a very large security presence to escort them in and out of town theyre very well taken care of if we know theyre going to be here
3568696 a lot of our assignments are at the board and theres a lot of reading to do
3568697 a lot of times they can pass a school screening and still have problems with the accommodative system which is the focusing system of the eye or they could have a problem with their eyes having a tendency of turning in or turning out a little bit
3568698 are they squinting do they get unusually close to things when they try to see something
3568699 i had a teacher one time tell me theres a couple of ways of learning theres experiencing theres listening and theres seeing and that poor vision just takes away one of the options

3568706 the reason was for national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3568707 the dominant factor is they dont have steady employment that leads to depression drugs drinking too much hanging with the wrong crowd
3568708 i believe in second chances and third chances and any number of chances so long as the individual impresses me that he or she is willing to take advantage of it to make something of his or her life
3568709 essentially anything a judge is willing to explore in an effort to help defendants succeed on probation and stay out of jail is something people should support

3568731 well you might be interested to know that i have pretty much finished writing the album and am scheduled to set foot in the studio in early may the record will be approached and recorded unlike any i have ever made before and will hopefully sound completely different too there will be just two musicians myself on piano and guitar and amy langley o and the songs will be recorded as complete live takes with no click tracks and just a minimum number of over dubs backing vocals and cello harmonies this is not vanity but an attempt to capture the natural dynamic of the music for it to ebb and flow to its own pulse not that of a band enslaved by bpm i want the warmth and feel that can only come from musicians recorded playing together the spill and bleed between mics the hiss and mistakes that form that secret magic most of the songs i have written by myself but there will be a couple of surprises the experience of performing the recent set of acoustic dates has given me the confidence to attempt this when i listen to the recordings of union chapel and queen elizabeth hall i cant help thinking that most of the songs sound better with this minimal arrangement that it somehow unlocks their beauty and soul anyone hoping for another animal nitrate or beautiful ones is going to be as disappointed as i would be if i had written one i am less and less interested in making pop music as the years go by and have virtually no interest in playing that whole sorry game dont get me wrong im still massively proud of my past but its just not what i want to be doing right now mmm ok well thats it so look out for stuff coming your way very soon take care and love your life
3568732 the re conviction rate for prisoners who have been through this drug treatment programme is 13 percent lower than for untreated prisoners

3568822 as long as people are doing it professionally its good for the people of blenheim the council and the wine industry
3568823 i would like to see performance information for schools available in the public domain and available most particularly to parents and the reason we want to do that is to not create simplistic league tables that tell you nothing we want there to be rich performance information available we want to understand who is studying in each school the number of children in each school who may face some form of educational disadvantage and need extra help and we want to understand how schools are attaining so we can compare schools in like positions and if ones doing better than the other find out why and then spread that best practice its in everybodys interest and certainly the interest of every australian child studying at school today for the maximum amount of information about our education system and their school to be available publicly and we will be pressing for that
3568824 it is this sort of information that the entire education establishment including teachers unions and state governments is determined to suppress
3568825 wa council of state school organisations president robert fry said data about school performance and demographics should be kept secret because it would invite unfair comparisons between schools

3568887 a better way to understand leverage is to think about which side at any given moment has the most to lose from a failure to agree
3568888 leverage often flows to the party that exerts the greatest control over and appears most comfortable with the present situation
3568889 to gain real leverage you must eventually persuade the other party that he or she has something concrete to lose in the transaction if the deal falls through
3568890 negative leverage threat leverage that gets peoples attention because potential losses loom larger in the human mind than do equivalent gains
3568891 normative leverage normative leverage is the ability to apply general norms or your opponents standards and norms to advance your position
3568892 this way of thinking about leverage also points to more sophisticated ways of enhancing your leverage that go beyond just improving your batna your goal is to alter the situation or at least the other partys perception of the situation so you have less to lose the other side has more to lose or both

3568902 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3568903 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3568904 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back

3568921 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3568922 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3568923 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3568924 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3568925 if we want to understand whats going to happen to climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3568926 they measure temperature and salinity as a function of depth as they dive down and up through the water column
3568927 from that information we can determine what the ocean currents are doing and so they provide us with a very detailed record of how temperatures and salinitys changed

3569005 obviously there are different points of view as to how to solve this
3569006 this event demonstrates the need to further strengthen our ties
3569007 it could be looked at as a blow but it could also be looked at as an opportunity

3569026 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment

3569051 we noticed a geographical correlation appeared in terms of attitudes towards shopping women are more practical in the south 88 of malaysians do not shop to show off and similarly 86 of singaporeans and they spend a low proportion of their monthly income on retail therapy in the north however mainland women spend a much higher proportion of their monthly income on shopping and enjoy this past time to show off 32 of shanghai women and 27 of beijing women hong kong women fall somewhere in the middle with 22 agreeing they shop to show off
3569052 while 31 of women in beijing admitted they are very concerned about the effects of climate change versus 18 of hong kong women this may well stem from the hope for a clean green successful olympics

3569056 i was certainly surprised and disappointed to see them bring these charges i cant understand why they didnt bring this up during the almost year that the case was pending
3569057 it seems to me like they were not happy law enforcement wasnt happy with the outcome of the case and now theyre trying to use the same set of facts to get more punishment
3569058 the magnitude of the case being kind of a big case and there were so many assets involved
3569059 right after the arrest we contacted the state franchise tax board and the irs it took them a year to put that case together
3569060 theres no double jeopardy the tax case is something totally different than selling drugs
3569061 now hes putting his life back together and working with his photography and trying to resolve all the forfeiture issues and the tax issues now hes got to deal with this its most unfortunate im very disappointed
3569062 bottom line it makes no sense to go after him and punish him again
3569063 its just bizarre that they wait until he was due to be released
3569064 they got the warrant the same day he was due to be released from jail was it a coincidence i doubt it
3569065 it takes them a lot longer for them to do the cases
3569066 they literally have to do a search warrant for all the bank records and everything related to his income and taxes for those five years
3569067 this gray area is very gray very dark and its hard for people who want to do this exactly the way theyre supposed to
3569068 its hard for people to know how to do it hoey has paid his taxes and hes prepared to rectify his tax statements but its really difficult to know how to do that

3569071 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3569072 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3569073 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3569074 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3569075 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3569076 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3569077 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3569078 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3569079 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3569080 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3569081 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3569082 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3569083 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3569092 ipass is the established market leader for global enterprise mobility and was our obvious choice when looking for a partner in this field

3569094 this partnership with iij one of japans leading mvnos will further solidify the mobile broadband presence of ipass in the critical japanese market

3569116 he impressed me a lot in the pre season game
3569117 hes shown very good poise while hes here intelligence hes picked things up very quickly he throws a real nice deep ball
3569118 going in i wasnt sure how i was going to play if it was going to be extremely fast but it turned out ok for me
3569119 and i still have a lot of room to improve
3569120 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3569121 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3569122 he was probably eight feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3569123 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3569124 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3569125 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3569126 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3569127 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3569128 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3569129 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3569130 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3569131 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him
3569132 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3569133 it was maybe a little more frustrating this time having played him last week and winning fairly easily
3569134 it seemed everyone in washington knew it was going to happen except me
3569135 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3569136 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3569137 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3569138 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3569139 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3569140 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3569141 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3569142 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3569143 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3569144 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3569145 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3569146 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3569147 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3569148 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3569149 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3569150 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3569151 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3569152 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3569153 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3569154 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3569155 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3569156 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3569157 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3569158 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3569159 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3569160 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3569161 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3569162 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3569163 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3569164 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3569165 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3569166 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3569167 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3569168 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3569169 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3569170 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3569171 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3569172 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3569173 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3569174 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3569175 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3569176 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3569177 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3569178 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3569179 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3569180 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3569181 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3569182 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3569183 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3569184 would howard dean and nancy pelosi have kept his name off the ballot
3569185 clinton and many of her backers believe that if there is a strategy of recognizing the new york senators delegates at the convention it would be a cathartic experience and lead to a more unified democratic party
3569186 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3569187 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3569188 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3569189 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3569190 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3569191 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats
3569192 at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3569193 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3569194 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3569195 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3569196 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3569197 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3569198 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3569199 the tragic effect of these events upon your son who i have no doubt you love sincerely is one of the most disturbing features of this crime
3569200 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humour and the familiar comfort of his voice
3569201 i love all yall i forgive all yall see yall when you get there
3569202 hes very smart very organized he just was always headed in this direction
3569203 every day he was looking to hurt someone it was the only satisfaction he got in life
3569204 viewing dorseys execution will not bring any happiness but weve lived to see justice for james 14 years later and today we pray for dorseys father
3569205 you hate to see that knowing that potentially if the technology had been as good when the crime was committed someone else would not have been killed
3569206 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks
3569207 hed walk down the street with a sawed off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open just to see the reaction of people
3569208 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3569209 you always want to go out and have a good day because then you can go inside that locker room and let guys know about it a little bit
3569210 you try to go out and do your job so you can always have a hand up on the guy
3569211 if were out here dominating the offense we can go back in the locker room while were eating and talk a lot of trash
3569212 you got to have some good days because if the defense keeps winning day after day youll never hear the end of it
3569213 when you look at the wide receivers and the quarterbacks there are certain things versus certain coverages that can just not be covered
3569214 thats because of timing and how long theyve played together
3569215 hes always been very talented but this year hes been able to get it together he isnt out of the woods
3569216 im just going to treat it like a game im going to go out and do my pregame rituals ive got to stay focused on doing what i got to do and just try to stay calm
3569217 you always want to go out and have a good day because then you can go inside that locker room and let guys know about it a little bit
3569218 you try to go out and do your job so you can always have a hand up on the guy
3569219 if were out here dominating the offense we can go back in the locker room while were eating and talk a lot of trash
3569220 you got to have some good days because if the defense keeps winning day after day youll never hear the end of it
3569221 when you look at the wide receivers and the quarterbacks there are certain things versus certain coverages that can just not be covered
3569222 thats because of timing and how long theyve played together
3569223 hes always been very talented but this year hes been able to get it together he isnt out of the woods
3569224 im just going to treat it like a game im going to go out and do my pregame rituals ive got to stay focused on doing what i got to do and just try to stay calm
3569225 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3569226 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3569227 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3569228 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3569229 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3569230 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3569231 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3569232 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3569233 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3569234 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3569235 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3569236 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3569237 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3569238 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3569239 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3569240 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3569241 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3569242 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3569243 t hey just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3569244 tried to make a point of protecting the innocent but none of them can be found
3569245 its a lot faster im still getting used to college football and everything that comes with it
3569246 im looking forward to traveling with the team since i didnt get to last year
3569247 this offseason i was along with 60 other guys up here and its different it was a good bonding experience with the team and we got a lot of work done
3569248 hes got a lot of potential and hes very athletic
3569249 i think he will be competing for his position he has some good people in front of him right now but hell put up a good fight if i know rod hell put up a very good fight
3569250 a lot of time for young guys in our program the key for them is special teams
3569251 its for those guys to earn the trust of the coaches and get their feet wet a little bit special teams is walkers route right now to find his way on the field
3569252 we are trying to find the best 11 on defense and the best 11 on offense so if walker finds himself there he will absolutely start there is no preconceived notion on where guys will end up as we go through things
3569253 i mean they are welcome to watch and find out but im not even sure what that is yet
3569254 roddy stayed here this summer and worked very very hard on what he was doing
3569255 hes in great shape but it only goes to how far he wants it to go if he works hard theres not a question about it
3569256 its a big difference from portsmouth high school but footballs football
3569257 the one thing about rod is hes trying to be like a sponge and soak this all up now hes got to figure out how to put it all into place
3569258 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3569259 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3569260 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september
3569261 oh glorious moon oh beautiful sister in the sky remember to value what it is to be alive
3569262 look at each other dont just stare at the band did i ever tell you that youre so fucking beautiful
3569263 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3569264 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3569265 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3569266 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3569267 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3569268 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3569269 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3569270 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3569271 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3569272 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3569273 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3569274 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3569275 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3569276 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3569277 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3569278 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3569279 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3569280 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3569281 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3569282 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3569283 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3569284 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3569285 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3569286 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3569287 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3569288 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3569289 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3569290 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3569291 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3569292 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3569293 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3569294 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3569295 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3569296 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3569297 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3569298 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3569299 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3569300 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3569301 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3569302 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3569303 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3569304 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3569305 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3569306 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3569307 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3569308 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3569309 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3569310 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3569311 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3569312 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3569313 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3569314 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3569315 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3569316 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3569317 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3569318 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3569319 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3569320 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3569321 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3569322 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3569323 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
3569324 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
3569325 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
3569326 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
3569327 it has all the makings of a real good line
3569328 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
3569329 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
3569330 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
3569331 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
3569332 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
3569333 mungkin saja subandi emosi akibat tak berhasil merayu istrinya untuk kembali merajut rumah tangganya
3569334 mereka sering bertengkar biasanya kakak saya yang datang ke rumah mbak namun karena mbak tak mau diajak kembali akhirnya bertengkar dua hari lalu mereka juga bertengkar
3569335 youre welcome courtney and they are so easy to make too
3569336 the mercury theaters own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo
3569337 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3569338 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3569339 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3569340 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3569341 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3569342 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3569343 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3569344 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3569345 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3569346 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3569347 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3569348 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3569349 who better to show off their hot legs for charity than a dedicated area fire crew
3569350 they give 100 to fighting fires and they are doing the same for the touched by cancer foundation
3569351 this is an outstanding cause and the money raised here in kansas city is put to use right here in kansas city
3569352 the cancer patients served by the tbcf wellness center are our own friends family members and neighbors were happy to be part of this program
3569353 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3569354 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3569355 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3569356 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3569357 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3569358 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3569359 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3569360 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3569361 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3569362 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3569363 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3569364 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3569365 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3569366 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3569367 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3569368 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3569369 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3569370 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3569371 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3569372 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

3569389 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year
3569390 confirmation of george storeys identification was made using dna together with compelling historical research

3569400 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3569401 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

3569410 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3569411 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3569412 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3569413 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3569415 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3569416 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3569417 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3569418 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3569419 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3569420 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3569421 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3569422 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3569423 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3569424 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3569427 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3569428 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3569429 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september

3569432 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3569433 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3569434 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3569435 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3569436 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3569437 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3569438 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3569439 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3569440 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3569441 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3569442 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3569443 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3569444 just so you all know we did set a record
3569445 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3569446 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3569447 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3569448 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3569449 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3569450 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3569451 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3569452 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

3569455 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3569456 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3569457 p shouted as he was cycling a few meters ahead of me
3569458 i replied bursting into a loud laughter in fact it was quite a relief since the weather forecast had not been too promising cycling in the rain would have been a different experience
3569459 all right but you will row and i will do nothing
3569460 i asked p when we started to pack our bags on monday morning it was so strong that it actually woke me up
3569461 i joined a couple of apartments together and did internal non structural refurbishment
3569462 every single person who did a refurbishment had the sign off from the executive committee of the owners corporation which was acting on best advice and in good faith
3569463 i am happy to comply with whatever rules and regulations are appropriate and anything the council now puts forward i dont think any resident would say anything to the contrary
3569464 there is a lot of anger in the building about the amount of noise and dust from the work the fact the lifts are used by builders and that the building managers and concierges spend too much time chasing after workmen to be able to do their jobs properly
3569465 major work including removing walls subdividing and consolidating apartments generally requires council consent to ensure correct safety amenity and construction processes are followed
3569466 works undertaken without first gaining council consent can be subject to fines and orders requiring the works to be rectified and can require development applications be lodged to seek consent for ongoing uses
3569467 pier 6 7 is in the walsh bay wharves precinct conservation area which is listed on the state heritage register this means that development consent for most works is also required from the heritage office
3569468 i dont have all the details but yes we have all the approvals
3569469 works have been going on for more than a year and i have had to live underneath it the whole time
3569470 bruce has been encouraging people to sell their apartments so they can be amalgamated with other apartments
3569471 wed been told there would be more amalgamations and that wed just have to cop it
3569472 all i wanted to do was find a way we could have some peace between renovations then i suppose i started asking the wrong questions
3569473 neither i nor anyone else at dynamic wishes to remove the chair of pier 6 7 we have no reason to want to do so and my actions are totally motivated by compliance with the law and the best interests of the scheme
3569474 even if the same person owns apartments on both sides of a common property wall that wall is still common property
3569475 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3569476 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3569477 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3569478 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3569479 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3569480 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3569481 se o concorrente tamb m deixar de utilizar o amianto poderemos trabalhar com margens maiores e disputar o mercado em p de igualdade
3569482 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3569483 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3569484 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3569485 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3569486 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3569487 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3569488 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3569489 its not what you expect especially when they make the claim that the 3g network is supposed to be that much faster
3569490 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3569491 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3569492 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3569493 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3569494 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3569495 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3569496 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3569497 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3569498 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3569499 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3569500 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3569501 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3569502 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3569503 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3569504 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3569505 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3569506 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3569507 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3569508 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3569509 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3569510 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3569511 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
3569512 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3569513 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3569514 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3569515 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3569516 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3569517 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3569518 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3569519 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3569520 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3569521 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3569522 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3569523 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3569524 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3569525 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3569526 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3569527 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3569528 click on the specific piece of puke and call in a janitor
3569529 we have starbucks and their evul librul lattes located kitty corner to each other
3569530 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years
3569531 it could be because spring is a prime buying season or it could be a sign that lenders are slowly beginning to increase direct mail still we dont expect significantly higher mail volume until the market settles and consumer confidence returns
3569532 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3569533 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3569534 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3569535 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3569536 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3569537 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3569538 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3569539 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3569540 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3569541 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3569542 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3569543 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3569544 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3569545 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3569546 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3569547 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3569548 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3569549 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3569550 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting
3569551 the problem that surfaced today is not related to exploitation of a security issue on esx
3569552 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3569553 like looking through two paper towel holders with cellophane taped over the ends
3569554 the lay public has the notion that we knock people on the head and they go to sleep and then we knock them on the head again and they wake up
3569555 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3569556 there is no real stand out in the race and i think franco the man should win especially if he gets a good run through the field
3569557 i led with franco the man and he and just jasper finished on terms
3569558 they sprinted the final quarter in 27 8sec they both hit the line really well and franco the man really hummed
3569559 his trial was nothing special but i felt that he had something
3569560 the barrier makes it a bit difficult for him but he still has a very good chance
3569561 he can sit and sprint with the best of them and with an ounce of luck he should run in the top three if he had drawn the front id say he would win
3569562 fear of loosing everything they accumulated and squandered by betryaing the society and poor people if dalits move into the media and if they become media moguls in india which will be the disastrous end to all those who are running the news group there will be hardly any non hindus
3569563 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3569564 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3569565 i will be doing an incident report the accident occurred on private property while the subjects were arguing

3569674 during these two years i was led to think much about religion by further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which christianity is supported that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become that the men at that time were ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us that the gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with the events that they differ in many important details far too important as it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies of eyewitnesses by such reflections as these which i give not as having the least novelty or value but as they influenced me i gradually came to disbelieve in christianity as a divine revelation but i was very unwilling to give up my belief i feel sure of this for i can well remember often and often inventing day dreams of manuscripts being discovered at pompeii or elsewhere which confirmed in the most striking manner all that was written in the gospels but i found it more and more difficult with free scope given to my imagination to invent evidence which would suffice to convince me thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but was at least complete the rate was so slow that i felt no distress and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct
3569675 we were even given that old line if we evolved from monkeys then why are there still monkeys around today

3569779 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3569780 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3569781 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3569782 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3569783 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3569784 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3569785 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it
3569786 when you are fighting a war you need as many soldiers as possible
3569787 why it change you tell me now yesterday i here and i get two hunnut dollah fah yen why eet so different today i only get hunnut eight dollah today how come why is that
3569788 in this case the council member has indicated hes worked out a number of issues that are involved and he supports the project
3569789 i was certainly surprised and disappointed to see them bring these charges i cant understand why they didnt bring this up during the almost year that the case was pending
3569790 it seems to me like they were not happy law enforcement wasnt happy with the outcome of the case and now theyre trying to use the same set of facts to get more punishment
3569791 the magnitude of the case being kind of a big case and there were so many assets involved
3569792 right after the arrest we contacted the state franchise tax board and the irs it took them a year to put that case together
3569793 theres no double jeopardy the tax case is something totally different than selling drugs
3569794 now hes putting his life back together and working with his photography and trying to resolve all the forfeiture issues and the tax issues now hes got to deal with this its most unfortunate im very disappointed
3569795 bottom line it makes no sense to go after him and punish him again
3569796 its just bizarre that they wait until he was due to be released
3569797 they got the warrant the same day he was due to be released from jail was it a coincidence i doubt it
3569798 it takes them a lot longer for them to do the cases
3569799 they literally have to do a search warrant for all the bank records and everything related to his income and taxes for those five years
3569800 this gray area is very gray very dark and its hard for people who want to do this exactly the way theyre supposed to
3569801 its hard for people to know how to do it hoey has paid his taxes and hes prepared to rectify his tax statements but its really difficult to know how to do that
3569802 yeeeah so i am pretty sure the comments you guys leave are funnier than the posts i am writing way to make me look bad dudes
3569803 well thats what you get for getting up in the morning what the hell is wrong with you stay in bed
3569804 congrats diva you do lick ass er i mean kick ass
3569805 i have two wonderful tactics that work well the most assertive or is it aggressive tactic ive used is the old coaching whistle right into the speaker of the phone blow it loud and blow it hard they never call back
3569806 when i assured him of partys full support and that everything would go smooth musharraf did not respond and avoided talking about impeachment
3569807 the school district is implementing a revamped dress code that includes a ban on cargo pants and requires students to wear collared shirts those from fifth through 12th grade who dont obey may also be put in prison style navy blue coveralls the district ordered from texas correctional industries the industrial arm of prison system
3569808 error kdesktop the process for the file protocol died unexpectedly
3569809 i think itd have very little effect in the long run
3569810 it will be a very small effect but there will be an effect i think itll be delayed probably over two or three years whatever the final effect will be
3569811 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year he said
3569812 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3569813 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree mr hockey said in a statement
3569814 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference
3569815 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums mr kilisch told the inquiry
3569816 id have to say its nowhere near the five per cent range that a number of people have talked about
3569817 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3569818 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3569819 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3569820 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3569821 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3569822 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3569823 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3569824 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3569825 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3569826 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3569827 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3569828 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3569829 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3569830 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3569831 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3569832 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3569833 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3569834 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3569835 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3569836 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3569837 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3569838 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3569839 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3569840 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3569841 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3569842 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3569843 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3569844 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3569845 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3569846 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3569847 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3569848 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3569849 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3569850 putting downwards pressure on inflation interets rates grocery bills housing but but but petrol
3569851 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3569852 lets forget everthing because the patient appareately really have a problem
3569853 im scared and i want to go home will you take me home
3569854 good night lydia please take care of lucy for me
3569855 how dare those evolutionists claim that we come from sponges
3569856 i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3569857 my vision is for the next generation of australian businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3569858 the personal was the political the sexual was the textual
3569859 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
3569860 we were really concerned they were missing out on some quality learning time especially since the first two hours are the literacy block

3569866 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3569867 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3569868 the u s is a country that needs to stand by a loyal ally
3569869 on the other hand it cannot risk military engagement because the stakes would be too high of a confrontation with russia
3569870 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3569871 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3569872 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3569873 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3569874 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3569875 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3569876 but about a year ago i started thinking about it now its my turn
3569877 jfk was a role model for everyone i knew back in the early 60s
3569878 hed spoken passionately during my high school graduation year about some new program he was starting called the peace corps i never forgot his message and i tucked it away in the back of my head to act on someday today is my someday
3569879 i had deferred peace corps service for about 30 years and have always wanted to do it
3569880 so then i met scott and he independently mentioned that peace corps was something he always wanted to do so that is kind of what brought it alive for me again
3569881 ive had a pretty good business career and good life and i thought it would be a good thing to give something back
3569882 it adds a full layer of protection to children adoptive parents and birth parents
3569883 increasing numbers of people interested in adoption will turn to foster care
3569884 the world paying attention in a way it hadnt before
3569885 if you hang in there you will be able to adopt
3569886 were not insensitive to children and dont want to condemn them to orphanages
3569887 without thaksin people can talk i think theres a feeling that we should have a new beginning
3569888 you can see that within the political class there are some true believers in thaksin but theres an awful lot of others who went with him because he was the man of the moment
3569889 if samak can hold the party together and strike the right compromises with thaksins antagonists maybe his government will last but most people are betting it wont
3569890 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics

3569901 i believe it was the holy koran which i keep with me in the truck that saved me from the bullets
3569902 in the summer months i would expect to be attacked once or twice a week
3569903 last week we were caught up in an attack on a convoy of fuel trucks on a road we are working on it looked like a war zone with five diesel tanks burst open by rocket propelled grenades and burning diesel flooding out over the road
3569904 the talibans new tactics of blowing bridges between kabul and kandahar forcing convoys to slow down and become softer targets is causing severe problems to companies trying to supply kandahar from kabul

3569939 uno puede ver que la indigencia o esa pobreza dura se ha mantenido en alrededor del 20 por ciento
3569940 lo que verdaderamente espanta es cuando una persona fuera de ideolog a o con esas trasnochadas ideolog as del pasado viene a repetirnos la historia y vuelve nuevamente con aventuras que no nos llevan a ning n lado

3569943 hoy estamos nuevamente en algunos casos volcando la mirada al pasado repitiendo aquellas historias que no deben de repetirse volviendo a tropezarnos con la misma piedra en algunos lugares

3569947 we havent had a proper nights sleep since it happened
3569948 i do love new zealand its very nice you have great ice cream too
3569949 i used to read for two hours a night so much its an important part of having fun and growing up
3569950 what i love about books is the whole fantasy thing an unknown world
3569951 if the first thing you do is charter a vessel head out and start taking samples and doing things like that the cost of that research is going to be huge
3569952 because we really dont know what the contributing factors really are we thought the best place to start is a review of what we already know trying to decide whether there is anything in the information we already have that points us in the direction of some cause
3569953 theyre not going to tell us anything we dont already know and theyre going to be based out of auckland so we dont understand the reasoning behind that
3569954 unfortunately these children can sometimes be labelled as naughty disruptive or non cooperative and its simply because they havent been able to follow what has been said
3569955 upon approval of our plans announced yesterday to transfer conseco senior health insurance company to an independent trust conseco will have completed the most significant element of its program to pursue strategic alternatives
3569956 the re conviction rate for prisoners who have been through this drug treatment programme is 13 per cent lower than for untreated prisoners
3569957 when you consider that 60 per cent of offenders are affected by alcohol or other drugs at the time of their offending and a staggering 83 per cent have abused alcohol or drugs at some point in their lives the positive impact of such programmes on the overall safety of communities is clear
3569958 the course is not an easy option to be eligible prisoners must be motivated to confront their addiction and accept the need to do something about it

3569968 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia
3569969 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3569970 it still comes as a hell of a shock but it was confirmation of what wed been hearing from everyone but the nzru
3569971 a calculated and prudent decision about the future of tasman for 2008
3569972 unless theres another offer forthcoming that doesnt require any other burden to the tasman rugby union and our entities in 2009 then we cant accept the offer
3569973 i dont think were going to be able to reverse their decision unless something comes from left field
3569974 if we dont do that then were giving up the fight and were not representing the interests of everybody who wants to see the tasman rugby union and the makos having a chance to continue
3569975 if we just accept their decision and start thinking about 2009 heartland then were letting a huge number of people down
3569976 theres no doubt that its going to have a major impact on rugby because were going to be playing in a competition that we dont really have any aspirations to want to play in
3569977 our aspirations were always to play in the air new zealand cup that was the whole purpose of the tasman rugby union coming together to give our talent a pathway to the higher level of provincial rugby
3569978 that has now been taken away from us so well find that the talent that we have here now will no doubt disappear because a lot of our players are professional rugby players they will seek employment opportunities elsewhere whether it be in new zealand or overseas
3569979 the gap between heartland and air new zealand cup is so wide that it will become a bit of a joke
3569980 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3569981 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3569982 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3569983 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3569984 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3569985 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3569986 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3569987 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3569988 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3569989 is no reason to usurp the real estate committees authority
3569990 it does take time and it does stagnate the process
3569991 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3569992 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3569993 i would like for them to be cautious and make sure they wont fall into north koreas trap
3569994 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3569995 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3569996 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3569997 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3569998 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3569999 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
