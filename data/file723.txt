7230003 im grunde berbr cke ich so die zeit bis zur preiserh hung aber wenn der dieselpreis wieder steigt komme auch ich um entlassungen und irgendwann sogar die insolvenz nicht herum
7230004 an gesellschaftlichen veranstaltungen teilzunehmen f llt mir schwer keiner wei das besser als meine frau
7230005 dieses gef hl das geschehen von au en zu beobachten in der schule war ich immer au enseiter und das ist auch lange so geblieben
7230006 ich habe ihn immer als laune des schicksals bezeichnet weil ich schauspieler geworden bin ohne an ruhm und reichtum zu denken
7230007 irgendwann habe ich lautstark verk ndet dass in unseren vier w nden keine demokratie herrscht sondern eine autokratie was meine frau oder ich sagen das gilt es gibt keine diskussion warum das so ist

7230040 many radio stations broadcast on both am and fm and unlike radio continental not all of them have the necessary legal documentation for broadcasting on both at the same time
7230041 where is the logic in depriving radio continental and only radio continental of its fm frequency and allowing it to keep its am frequency
7230042 comfers absurd and discriminatory decision is based on a later amended article in a broadcasting law which was adopted during the military dictatorship and which the present government had promised to repeal this measure is legally unsound and politically inept and suggests that radio continental is paying for its editorial decisions we hope its appeal is successful
7230043 that it was supported so that it can run through
7230044 that the maintenance of the distance is supported between the cars with the preceding vehicles which a marketing car is already equipped with and the inside of the lane neatly and the prototype of the system that operation is supported was completed
7230045 the car driven automatically not to hit other cars to the destination

7230061 they havent yet reached the holy grail of i want to go from here to there show me my options
7230062 in the u s we are primarily a driving country or have been for a very very long time
7230063 there are some horror stories of the past of people being routed onto the appalachian trail or a couple driving off the ferry dock
7230064 i get a lot of calls from people especially now with gas prices being up looking for routes for how to get to work
7230065 i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country
7230066 the very same people who have said that the main thrust of the bush administrations policies will have dire consequences to the future of our society
7230067 two years ago the president made a huge swath of the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument barring fishing oil and gas extraction and tourism from its waters and coral reefs the area is the single largest conservation area on the planet
7230068 making them off limits to fishing and energy development is the most stringent of the possible measures outlined
7230069 it is unclear if bush will designate these new areas as monuments or use another executive mechanism that would allow limited fishing and other activities
7230070 hey remember halloween yeah that movie made some pretty big money lets remake that
7230071 lets go get some more beer and weed and lets head over to the beach and get wasted
7230072 oh hey did you write up a speech in case you win
7230073 oh heck no im up against the ugly betty head writer
7230074 when is your last day are you giving me enough notice to find you a replacement
7230075 listen miss i dont care who you have to call or where your paperwork is we are here to inspect and like it or not with or without permission we are going into your treatments rooms read your city ordinance and realize that we have the right to do so that we can shut you down in a second and take your little ass to jail because we have no record of you having applied for the license to be in charge of this place
7230076 gentlemen i am so sorry for the misunderstanding lets try to figure this out i do want to cooperate lets not be hasty would you like some coffee tea water how about we go into my office to discuss what you need from us and how to do the inspection
7230077 under the table and getting paid cash i thought you had a right to now since you are the director i figured you would not want anything like this to take place right under your nose i know you will do the right thing because even though you are so young you are smart
7230078 they did not think it was wrong they figured if the clients wanted it and we the company did not want to buy vanessa a micro machine it was outstanding that she had incurred in the expense herself and provided the service to the clients and got paid for it
7230079 bridal program packages she was talking about i was wondering what new thing they might be advertising for the spa without telling me
7230080 this was a proposal i submitted to mr r and the sales department like five months ago nobody ever got back to me to tell me it was approved no one sent me ad copy to review nothing is in place at the spa to do any of it i had no idea
7230081 thats not my problem you better get your butt in gear and get something ready for your interview tomorrow this is a huge magazine the catering department sold four couples the package they start next week and the magazine writer is going to follow their program and progress it is huge it would be the best exposure you would ever get and if you dont have it ready it will be the worst nightmare you could ever imagine and mr r would probably fire you over it
7230082 let me work it out to the best of my ability and take the bull by the horns
7230083 i better start the process at least 2 months out just in case it is as hard as they say to find candidates
7230084 but nails is what get clients through the door and then we sell them the more expensive services
7230085 why oh why what do i like about it that keeps me doing it
7230086 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
7230087 great job on doing this campaign but can i ask why you chose a map that includes gaza and the west bank
7230088 its sad to me that instead of focusing on the campaign you choose to accuse me of having hidden political motives which i dont i didnt choose the map the student union graphic designer did surely if she had drawn in borders someone would email me about why i am giving the palestinians a state at any rate i dont think this is the place to involve politics in what is connected to human cultural heritage and im sure that in gaza they are also throwing their cigarette butts on the beach
7230089 i think what you are doing is important with or without giving the palestinians a state but i wrote to you because the small things show political motives even if we dont want them to perhaps we have reached a point where apolitical israeli organizations cannot use maps in their logos
7230090 if i had a graphic designer i would redo the logo but a lack of borders doesnt have to imply occupation it can also imply unity and solidarity
7230091 the soul of my son shechem longs for your daughter please give her to him in marriage
7230092 intermarry with us give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves
7230093 thus you shall live with us and the land shall be open before you live and trade in it and acquire property in it
7230094 if i find favor in your sight then i will give whatever you say to me
7230095 ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift and i will give according as you say to me but give me the girl in marriage
7230096 we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised for that would be a disgrace to us
7230097 but if you will not listen to us to be circumcised then we will take our daughter and go
7230098 these men are friendly with us therefore let them live in the land and trade in it for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them
7230099 will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours only let us consent to them and they will live with us
7230100 you have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and my men being few in number they will gather together against me and attack me and i will be destroyed i and my household
7230101 if ms star can have it here so can i
7230102 inconsiderate b was her and after watching her for two hours trying to get her lines right she was not even a good actor anyway and she would not touch her dirty feet for all the money in the world
7230103 thank you for doing this you fixed the rest of my day cause if she stayed pissed she was going to be pissed at me
7230104 so far the elite ones are not really standing out the sport is not popular enough and the production of backup talents is far from adequate
7230105 we have no more absolute advantage in either degree of difficulty or consistency of execution
7230106 now weve only got a few elite divers we must have more i believe there are plenty of them in china but we have to find them out and raise them up in the next four years
7230107 but as for the individual events we are losing our leading position
7230108 we are still seemingly so strong with the seven golds and i am also happy with them but we should also see the potential of crisis
7230109 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7230110 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7230111 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7230112 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7230113 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7230114 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7230115 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7230116 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7230117 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7230118 we did our best but the best was not enough
7230119 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7230120 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7230121 obviously for me its the best sport in the world so i think it should always be top of the list
7230122 obviously its still important there are still great players and great teams performing over here so at the end of the day its still my number one sport whether its looked at as different
7230123 there are so many other great sports in the olympics so many other great athletes that have worked so hard to get here
7230124 maybe ill be 37 then so im not sure ill still be playing but you never know
7230125 just because were a smaller country we dont have to be like a dog put your tail in your behind and then leave we cannot do that because even being a small country we have our pride
7230126 we have not yet seen the complaint and without having done so we are not in a position to comment
7230127 i cant imagine what happens if this situation is allowed what can happen in another international track and field meet with countries filing after the official timeline
7230128 the one that has to apply the rules is the iaaf
7230129 however the question is can they really provide evidence that we are not correct
7230130 hopefully they dont also say that bolt stepped on the line
7230131 who could have ever imagined that rps would get this big
7230132 i often play for money so i need to stay in the best shape possible
7230133 if women running around with ribbons and hula hoops can go to the olympics so can we

7230150 the peace agreement has led us to a new competition between the different groups in the eastern front for sharing in power
7230151 this competition has had a negative effect on the eastern front this is a crisis of transition its only been two years and its normal
7230152 in the end we could see the disintegration of the eastern front it will also have a negative repercussion on the already slow moving implementation of the eastern sudan peace agreement

7230190 el estigma y la verg enza que la gente siente al sufrir este tipo de estr s tal y como lo llamamos hoy empeora mucho m s si no se sabe que otros ya lo sufrieron en el pasado o lo est n padeciendo ahora mismo y puede ser muy liberador saber que uno no est solo en esto

7230215 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7230216 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7230217 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7230218 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7230219 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7230220 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7230221 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7230222 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7230223 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7230224 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7230225 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7230226 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7230227 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7230228 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7230229 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7230230 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7230231 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7230232 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7230233 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7230234 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7230235 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7230236 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7230237 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7230238 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7230239 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7230240 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7230241 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7230242 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7230243 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7230244 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7230245 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7230246 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7230247 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7230248 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7230249 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7230250 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7230251 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7230252 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7230253 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7230254 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7230255 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7230256 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7230257 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7230258 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7230259 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7230260 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7230261 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7230262 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7230263 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7230264 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7230265 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7230266 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7230267 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7230268 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7230269 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7230270 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7230271 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7230272 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7230273 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7230274 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7230275 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7230276 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7230277 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7230278 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7230279 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7230280 this is a planning took where all things are going
7230281 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7230282 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7230283 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7230284 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7230285 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7230286 well i dont go out there very much and hes not harming anyone
7230287 hey i bet that spider is going to move over to the front door just to freak me out nah whatever its just a spider
7230288 why the fuck did you let it go its going to return now twice as pissed
7230289 its just a spider hes gone now he wont be back
7230290 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7230291 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7230292 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7230293 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7230294 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7230295 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7230296 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7230297 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7230298 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7230299 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7230300 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7230301 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7230302 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7230303 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7230304 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7230305 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7230306 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7230307 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7230308 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

7230312 our support of the aperture nature photography workshop is an example of our commitment to make simple safe and expandable storage technology available to photography enthusiasts
7230313 we are honored to work with a digital media pioneer like scott bourne to help educate photographers on the ins and outs of using drobo in their aperture workflows to protect irreplaceable image files
7230314 drobo has earned a reputation within the mac community as being the go to storage solution so partnering with data robotics on this project seems like the most natural choice for us and something we expect will make workshop participants all the more successful
7230315 this workshop will provide an opportunity for pro photographers to share techniques and best practices while experiencing the benefits of world class industry products such as drobo in a fully immersive field environment

7230323 sentilla labs is so powerful because it brings together the community of developers to collaborate on pervasive applications that directly impact our world
7230324 this is a powerful site for the java community enabling us to share ideas and build applications that we didnt know were possible with pervasive software
7230325 sentilla labs lets you test out ideas build a project and then post it for discussion with other developers
7230326 the curfew was imposed in all 10 districts in kashmir valley on sunday the second day of a three day strike called by separatist groups who are demanding an end to indian rule
7230327 it is really unfortunate that the government of india has resorted to its old policy of suppression and oppression all the protests have been peaceful and there hasnt been a single incident of arson
7230328 we will go ahead with mondays rally its meant to be a peaceful one the authorities have been unnerved by millions participating in the protests

7230385 so it has not been difficult for me to put my stamp on the club and players
7230386 chelsea played very well but they just didnt win one game so for me it is not a bad season they got to the carling cup final but they lost to spurs
7230387 they finished second in the league to manchester united and lost by just two points on the last day and they also lost the final of the champions league

7230398 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7230399 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7230400 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7230401 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7230402 we need to hear from mr rudd how he will address the current slowdown without rudd speak and without a commitment to simply watch
7230403 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7230404 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates
7230405 mr wayne swan and mr tanner are kidding themselves if they think they are responsible for any downwards movements in interest rates

7230437 you should be very wary of contributing all bacterial contamination to sewage the natural load of the river will rise significantly with natural catchments from the fields which are graced with animals faeces and consequent bacteria there is still some bacteria coming from sewage overflow pipes but this is controlled they overflow with dilute sewage and rainwater when we have extreme weather conditions
7230438 there was heavy rain 32mm during the period before this sample was taken
7230439 considering the wet summer and the increased number of sites from last year this is a fairly satisfactory performance on most days water quality has been good or of the highest excellent quality but clearly conditions can be affected by pollution from rainfall related wash off from land or urban drainage

7230446 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is
7230447 the students are the worst suffered lot it is examination time but because of the agitations and protests our colleges are closed had it not been for the agitations we would have got our degrees in two or three months and we would have been practising law by now but unfortunately no solution has been derived for the situation till now and we are suffering because of it
7230448 please it is my sincere request to the people to let our schools and colleges open we want to study it doesnt make sense to promote students to another class without examinations there should be an end to the situation you cannot go on fighting for two or three years without any resolve the situation has to come to an end so why not now
7230449 we are keeping a close watch since the incident took place
7230450 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
7230451 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the maritime and coastguard agency mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
7230452 once the court is restored the coalition government will move to grant immunity to musharraf
7230453 yet this will not break up the coalition the coalition partners understand that they may not agree hundred per cent on all issues but they want to keep the alliance intact
7230454 the prime minister told the americans that if you want our politics to mature let us handle our domestic issues through normal political processes and without external interference
7230455 and the americans understood if zardaris nomination had happened six months ago assistant secretary of state richard would have been in islamabad by now but now americans see this as an internal pakistani issue
7230456 some people in pakistan say that all important decisions in pakistan are taken by allah america and the army in that order
7230457 we want to change that paradigm and we are working seriously on it
7230458 estamos preocupados seriamente con este tema y estamos haciendo llamamientos constantes al gobierno socialista para que tome medidas porque no puede abandonar a la gente a su suerte
7230459 se trata de un gobierno que no quiso tomar en cuenta las propuestas de iu para limitar la capacidad de endeudamiento de la familias como ocurre en otros pa ses europeos y que ten a efectos beneficiosos sobre los precios de mercado porque los ajustar a
7230460 pues ahora prosigui que zapatero asuma estas consecuencias de su pol ticas y ayude a esas familias a las que ha permitido hipotecarse por encima de sus posibilidades con medidas reales para paliar la situaci n
7230461 estamos viendo ya las consecuencias estamos conociendo situaciones concretas y no hay m s que ver los datos de los propios juzgados para ver que estamos ante un incremento aunque un incremento menor que en espa a de las ejecuciones de hipotecas por impago
7230462 as como en espa a han apostado b sicamente por la vivienda libre en euskadi el peso de la vivienda protegida es muy fuerte
7230463 en poca de crisis hay muchos constructores que se han refugiado en la vivienda protegida para mantener su actividad y su empleo y es bueno porque eso aten a las consecuencias de la crisis
7230464 the economy is heading towards a meltdown there is no way pakistan can win this prolonged war against militants and this government is the most incompetent in our history
7230465 in these circumstances this government is not going to last long for the next six months i would predict you should hang on to your seatbelt there is going to be a lot of turbulence ahead
7230466 if the government persists with a very unpopular american policy of fighting terrorism there could be anarchy and destabilisation under musharraf it was heading towards civil war and with zardari i think the deterioration could happen more quickly
7230467 you dont really dislike the church you are suffering from an anti establishment syndrom
7230468 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7230469 the idea behind the initiative is to get a national debate and dialogue going to see if there is a better way to address binge drinking
7230470 we as a culture and society are sending a terrible message about drinking to our youth we let you drive at 16 let you get married at 18 we let you go off and potentially die for your country in iraq or afghanistan at 18 but you cant drink a beer until youre 21
7230471 the whole topic of alcohol and abuse issues and in particular its relationship to violence and sexual assaults its something we are very sensitive to
7230472 we are not going to take a stand either way in the near future at this point we are aware of the initiative and right now we are more concerned with the broader issue
7230473 the initiative asks us to take a step back and look at the laws we have in place at the local state and federal level
7230474 i have a feeling that this will pick up some momentum as people come back to campus
7230475 when you have students living eating learning and playing on your campus you really have them 24 7 you do worry about their safety
7230476 but how do you deal with them drinking when theyre not supposed to be but they are still drinking to excess
7230477 almost any serious incident involving student behavior is alcohol related
7230478 saying thou shalt not has not given us any desired affect
7230479 we are educators and we should also be trying to teach the students how to be responsible adults its about helping them get a life its about being of service to others
7230480 just because kids get way too crazy and i think that lowering the age would lead to even more drinking
7230481 we havent won gold in eight years a lot of people doubted that nba stars could play together
7230482 after i got into foul trouble early i played a little cautious
7230483 but in the fourth quarter coach k told me to let that momma loose and thats what i tried to do

7230489 the cyclist is a man half made of flesh and half of steel that only our century of science and iron could have spawned
7230490 my family car is an sub and i love it on my new sport utility bicycle i can cart groceries take my kids shopping haul a barbecue grill and make a margarita
7230491 when the spirits are low when the day appears dark when work becomes monotonous when hope hardly seems worth having just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road without thought on anything but the ride you are taking
7230492 a seat and handlebars have a magical way of bringing out a childish enthusiasm that is too often thrown by the wayside as we grow up its always there waiting to be revived and when you find it again its fun and strangely familiar just like riding a bike
7230493 i ride a bike im greener than a hung over carnival cruise passenger in a hurricane

7230527 sometimes the memories from the book were clearer to her than what happened yesterday
7230528 has been tremendous motivation for me to do this with other people
7230529 i dont want the book to be a bone of contention
7230530 ive always had a good memory but she drew out the best of me
7230531 i used to walk in the front way because i was so proud to work here
7230532 i realized how hard my parents worked and how much they struggled
7230533 who during the worst of the depression opened their home to those who were in need of a home cooked meal and a place to wash up the seed of giving to others was planted so many years ago in the soil of ventura
7230534 he wasnt a sanctimonious earnest peacenik he didnt speak to the converted he took his message to service clubs across the country he was committed vocal but delightful
7230535 after he wrote his book smyth became an evangelist for boyds memory whom he figured had been overlooked by history he went across canada lecturing about him at his own expense
7230536 you can quibble about the details about the way boyd organized his flight but you cant quibble about his dedication and his contributions to canadian aviation
7230537 he was never shy about expressing his well informed opinion he had something to say about everything from the regulation of private flying to the best approach to world peace
7230538 he grabbed every chance to get into the air accompanying flights to all parts of our vast country and across the oceans to faraway lands

7230545 rafael said you have to tell me if it is a good deal or not because i dont have a comparison
7230546 its nice to see the american culture i can see all the races that are here all the diversity
7230547 i like calculus its my favorite subject i would like to teach calculus some day but most of the hispanic people are at the levels of algebra and geometry
7230548 in california students need to take two math courses but in plainfield they have to take three courses thats great because they need to pass algebra ii or even pre calculus
7230549 they say to me teacher they think im a fool because i dont speak english but i understand all of this math
7230550 i had to leave all my things the transition has been incredible
7230551 the people here are great i think i have a family here
7230552 rafael brought information from tlaxcala and gifted me with movies and maps we talk about the two cultures their similarities and differences
7230553 the district is very worried about the children they are getting resources and options to make students successful and we are only one option
7230554 they can focus on the classroom and focus on students
7230555 it has been a win win for anyone who has helped them and for them as well
7230556 the message that i always try to give them every single day the most languages you know the more advantages you will have in the future
7230557 we were talking about food a student asked me if we ate tacos in spain
7230558 i told him we dont eat tacos in spain and he looked at me

7230607 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7230608 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that

7230615 weve spent the last nine months living apart but you have to put handball first or youll never make it
7230616 we sat down with uk sport and went through the criteria we were looking for
7230617 skills in ball sports were desirable height essential we were looking for a minimum of 5ft 11in for women and 6ft 6in for men
7230618 we had all the photos on the wall and debated the rationale behind picking each player

7230622 in the sydney olympics handball was voted the most popular spectator sport
7230623 but their handball association wasnt ready for the demand that followed they had one man and a dog in the office and they were getting 6 000 calls a day they couldnt deal with it and the chance to develop in australia died
7230624 were already putting plans in place to ensure that doesnt happen

7230631 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included

7230682 the epic fail guy is a meme in which anonymous will draw images of a stick figure and imageboard roleplay this character going about various methods of failing completely this minor forced meme grew into a true meme of epic proportions when in one adventure he pulled a guy fawkes mask out of a bin this image of a stickfigure wearing a mask much like in v for vendetta became a meme and from then on most depictions of efg will involve this mask guy fawkes was an english catholic terrorist who tried to destroy the anglican establishment by blowing up the english parliament in london the only person to ever enter parliament with honest intentions guy the epic failure was pwned before he could enact the gunpowder plot because king james utilized an early form of the secret service to stop the plan thus guy became an epic fail that would be remembered for at least 1000 years

7230913 every time i got a text message i hoped it was barack
7230914 but when it came down to it i was left out
7230915 weve been using text messaging and e mail from the beginning of the campaign and i think well keep using them as a way to keep our supporters engaged and connected
7230916 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7230917 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7230918 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7230919 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7230920 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7230921 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7230922 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7230923 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7230924 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7230925 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7230926 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7230927 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7230928 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7230929 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7230930 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7230931 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7230932 i eat drink sleep and even dream birds birds are my vocation as well as my avocation
7230933 do you know where i can buy the best fries in the world
7230934 i was just talking to miss grant here but if thats all mildred ill see you next lesson
7230935 im sure professor malfoy wanted an erm a private word
7230936 i dont know how you put up with the children enough to talk to them after hours
7230937 in fact i really do think you need to be taught a lesson
7230938 really malfoy and you think youre the one to teach me do you
7230939 just what do you think you are doing miss grant
7230940 for the love of merlin cant you be a little more discreet
7230941 banging scraping furniture malfoy said he was going to teach professor potter a lesson
7230942 i have heard that the malfoy familys a bit dodgy
7230943 but still and if what you said is true why is professor malfoy even still here and look hes even sitting next to professor potter
7230944 perhaps malfoy is blackmailing him and snapes in on it as well
7230945 and did you see his neck im almost sure there was a bruise there that just proves it malfoy has been attacking him repeatedly i just knew he was evil
7230946 and that just brings us back to our first question why doesnt professor potter just tell someone about it
7230947 you know what professor potters like youve read enough he probably doesnt want to bother anyone hes a war hero
7230948 the headmistress would put a stop to it if only she knew
7230949 have you noticed that malfoy always sits next to professor potter
7230950 looming over him like some like some evil little ferret
7230951 just what do you think you are doing miss grant
7230952 how in merlins name did they ever end up as a couple
7230953 professor potters just so nice and malfoys its professor malfoy
7230954 apparently a war hero who had no idea that he was being closely followed by an 11 year old girl
7230955 miss grant if youve quite got over your shock theres the small matter of
7230956 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
7230957 strong opposition to lowering the national drinking age to 18
7230958 raising the drinking age to 21 reversed a dangerous increase in alcohol related highway fatalities involving teen drivers and the national highway traffic safety administration has concluded that raising the drinking age to 21 has saved more than 25 000 lives since 1984
7230959 im quite certain that could be done would you prefer block or script letters

7231041 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7231042 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7231043 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7231044 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7231045 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7231046 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us

7231048 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years

7231050 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement

7231078 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined
7231079 we should find out first how big the fire is and how soon it will be extinguished in order to assess the damage
7231080 but the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries

7231105 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7231106 proud to show the strength of the chinese people with my fist
7231107 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7231108 the reply we received from authorities was that this was an application of chinese law
7231109 the ioc is not a sovereign organisation and we have to respect chinese law

7231113 we try to do the best we can this is kind of a stressf ul time for everybody you know everybody is scared
7231114 the u s is far from the best health care system in the world even though its by far the most expensive
7231115 what is disturbing about these findings is that while the u s ranked first on health care spending in the world we are often last in measures of quality of care
7231116 higher spending doesnt mean that we receive more or better care we simply pay more
7231117 we can do better we have the wealth the health care institutions the dedicated professionals the technological process the medical research and the ingenuity required to make the u s health care system the best in the world
7231118 the u s is unique among advanced industrialized nations for failure to provide basic universal coverage to insure access and remove the fear of financial consequences in bills when ill
7231119 the broad health care divide by income and the growing gap between us and other countries is putting the workforce and the nation at risk
7231120 by placing more pressure on your feet as you stand or walk the joints and ligaments have to work harder to maintain foot structure and the more pressure your feet have to accommodate the more your feet will splay or stretch out when you bear weight overtime your feet will stop bouncing back and they will eventually just stay wider
7231121 we see peoples misery every day of the week and its not just those with weight problems our shop staff and our 24 7 helpline are helping more and more customers who are in so much discomfort they just dont know what to do
7231122 so many people especially women fail to wear the right shoes they will flog their feet to death in ill fitting footwear because they wrongly believe they cant buy the right style and fashions at the right price in wider larger foot sizes
7231123 more and more brides are spending their big day in pain on what should be the happiest day of their lives
7231124 wearing the wrong shoes can cause a host of problems including bunions corns hammer toes and even tumours the population at large is growing but most shoes are still made to fit a size that is increasingly no longer average

7231128 parents can stop nagging and let on task on time be their guide
7231129 we are proud of the sites continued growth through turbulent market conditions healthy safe and unique products coupled with great customer service has proven to be a winning formula for us from day one however the greatest reward for us has been the friendships we have made with so many people both two and four legged
7231130 we want to give a little back to all of our loyal customers so well be running specials all month long on healthy dog supplies as well as offering lots of great training and health care tips
7231131 we donate ten percent of our yearly profits in cash and product
7231132 we were inspired to start puplife com after rescuing a little black lab named daisy and nursing her back to health she passed away earlier this year but she continues to be the heart and soul of this company its in our dna to constantly give back to these wonderful groups
7231133 she is a big foodie we like to say that she really has a nose for great products
7231134 we have some great new features planned for the site we are dedicated to making each and every customer experience the best it can be
7231135 one of the fastest growing online retailers in the pet supply industry

7231138 vandaag was school weer niet veel soeps we begonnen met periode biologie waar ik mijn presentatie ging houden ik las meer dan de helft voor maar had het tenminste zelf geschreven als avond eten aten we tomaten soep
7231139 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7231140 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that
7231141 politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
7231142 cameron has fashioned a new conservative language but his attachment to the market means he cant actually make britain a fairer society he can only talk about it
7231143 but what do we do about the poorer students how do we get them to learn how to learn

7231158 many girls feel more comfortable around dogs than they do around horses
7231159 the animal is going to mirror the emotions the girls are expressing
7231160 the benefit is that there is this exchange going on between the girls and the dogs
7231161 the bottom line is that animals are always in the present
7231162 when the girls work with them it can be magical

7231165 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
7231166 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
7231167 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7231168 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7231169 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7231170 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7231171 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7231172 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7231173 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues

7231178 despite the french brokered cease fire framework that russia accepted it is striving to maintain considerable economic and military pressure on georgia a close ally of the united states the ultimate goal it seems is the ouster of its president mikheil saakashvili who is detested by the russian leadership and the installation of a government that it considers less hostile

7231263 if they want the nation to take this cup seriously why dont we play on a good pitch the grass was too long many players had trouble staying on their feet im not saying we would have won on a better pitch but at least the fans would have seen better football
7231264 when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality thats what we didnt do and thats a good lesson it was the kind of game where you could not afford a mistake at the back or at a set piece i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half
7231265 im disappointed we didnt get three points i thought we were the better team on the night
7231266 it definitely felt good just to be on the field with the guys
7231267 as a striker any time you come into a 0 0 game you know there are chances there that are waiting for you i just wanted to help make an impact we definitely had chances to score and put the game away in the end it was a little disappointing but at the same time it was good to be a part of it and create some chances
7231268 these last five months with this mystery injury not knowing what it is and then surgery and then no surgery i could probably write a book about the frustration ive had and gone through but i dont want any sympathy and i m not going to sit here and cry about it im just going to put it behind me im going to focus on right now the team has nine or 10 games left and we have to get results
7231269 as a team we didnt play well we didnt pass the ball well today as a winger you kind of rely on everybody else getting you the ball so well take a point and move on
7231270 its a different standard of play to be honest theyve got me good players here its probably not as physical here its a lot more rough and tumble over there
7231271 i got double teamed a lot in england not many teams played me one on one its been a little bit different here they kind of play me one on one
7231272 hes dynamic tonight for some reason we couldnt really get him the ball in the right areas chivas did a good job of shutting him down they did a nice job of sort of denying him the ball but when he did get it it was exciting for us and everything good came of that when we did get him the ball in space but we didnt play well we didnt really get him the ball but having said that when he did get it i thought he was dynamic and had a chance to win the game at the end hes a player whos exciting to watch but hes good to have on your team because he stretches teams hes very direct thats one of the reasons ive really liked him ive seen him for years he gets it and goes straight at the defender and tries to get in a cross or a shot hes not looking to keep the ball hes looking to go at people and he wants to make the difference in games and i love that
7231273 there would be an extra burden if we did not sign another striker
7231274 fulham started stronger than us and were quicker into the game
7231275 in the second half it was all us but in fairness credit must go to fulham
7231276 they were always sharp and motivated and defended very well and we didnt create enough chances to win the game
7231277 in the first half we were dominated and not strong or quick enough and we suffered
7231278 we tried very hard into the last second of the game but we could not score
7231279 the blame is with the team and we accept that blame together
7231280 he wasnt in the squad because he wasnt in the right condition to play
7231281 its a situation that is very personal there are players able to play under these circumstances and others whose head is not right berbatov is in the latter category
7231282 well have a meeting with the player and clarify a few points and see if there is a decision to be made
7231283 the team is playing good so like i said i dont need to rush
7231284 he probably could play but i do think that he could probably use the time to be on the field and he could probably even get better for us
7231285 this is a situation where i dont think we have to rush into it if we dont have to
7231286 when i woke up i was thinking thats fine for me if they need a couple of more days
7231287 the more days i get the closer i get to 100 percent
7231288 the idea is that we do want michael to stay all of us
7231289 we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties
7231290 i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here and i have made it absolutely clear i want him
7231291 ive never had a more frustrating summer we came fifth and a lot of clubs look at everton as the right way to do things
7231292 weve not spent massively to finish fifth we have progressed every year this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression
7231293 i dont need to buy mid premier league players i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7231294 why is there a problem getting people in it is a bit of everything weve got all these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week
7231295 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure that it is going to happen
7231296 the lad wants to play football but hes shown over the last two weeks what an important player he is for us
7231297 ive no intention of letting any of the players weve got with us go
7231298 we feel we can achieve good things this season and its important we keep our first team squad together
7231299 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
7231300 i will take my final decision next week after meeting with gareth southgate he told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
7231301 weve put some offers out to some players and i think those are well documented
7231302 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7231303 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7231304 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7231305 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7231306 it was a great result because they are one of the better sides in this division
7231307 they have quality players in all areas of the pitch but we battled showed great determination and played some very nice football and in the end deserved our victory
7231308 we could have sank after they scored their second equaliser but we didnt we got back up pushed forward and snatched a deserved victory
7231309 winning today will help us get maybe one or two other players at the level that we really need
7231310 we will be looking to get in a few more players next week
7231311 they did what they are supposed to do i made some pitches down the middle of the plate and they put the bat on it i still dont feel like i have a good fastball but its improving
7231312 i was just throwing the ball down the middle of the plate
7231313 it felt good to get that one but the damage was already done
7231314 its kind of bittersweet because we didnt win so it doesnt really make a difference

7231339 die mannschaft hat zu wenig zutrauen in sich gezeigt wenn man die m glichkeit bekommt die bayern zu schlagen muss man es auch tun wir haben bekommen was wir verdient haben mit dem punkt m ssen wir leben
7231340 zu beginn hat ihre mannschaft die fans beeindruckt wieso spielte sie sp ter wie gel hmt
7231341 die anfangsphase war wirklich sehr gut wir waren lebendig und aktiv haben ein unglaublich sch nes tor erzielt wenn man aber das zweite tor nicht macht wird es schwer ich bin deshalb mit unserem spiel nicht zufrieden
7231342 ihre abwehr war im durchschnitt unter 21 jahre alt hatte insgesamt weniger als 40 bundesliga spiele absolviert war dies nicht ein wagnis

7231363 it is not that you can blame three four or five tenths on an engine only
7231364 i think with the regulations how they are now all the teams i think and all the different engine manufacturers are quite close together maybe one has an advantage on this kind of circuit and maybe one has the advantage on another kind of circuit
7231365 it depends on the characteristics but i think there are more things playing a key role aerodynamic efficiency what package you use and how much downforce you use
7231366 then there are other things simple things like straight line speed and car height there are many things so it would not be smart to blame one thing

7231401 e previsto che ci sia anche questa tranche il superamento del bicameralismo perfetto con la realizzazione di un senato federale accompaganto da una riduzione del numero dei parlamentari ma limportante approvare il federalismo fiscale senza il quale non ci sono le risorse per far funzionare le riforme costituzionali
7231402 e da discutere se prendiamo come riferimento la bozza violante prevede che il premier abbia pi poteri ad esempio anche quello di revocare i ministri e poi che venga nominato dal presidente della repubblica tenendo conto del risultato delle elezioni c cos una costituzionalizzazione di quello che oggi gi di fatto
7231403 lo vedremo abbiamo sempre pensato che la corte costituzionale dovesse essere rappresentativa anche delle regioni e dei territori
7231404 su sicurezza e immigrazione siamo impegnati il ministro maroni ha lavorato molto bene dobbiamo sostenere lazione del governo nellapplicazione della legge bossi fini sullimmigrazione e un maggiore controllo bisogna arrivare allapplicazione a regime di tutti i suoi principi e dei provvedimenti necessari nellesercitare lazione di contrasto si tratta di provvedimenti che il governo varer per assicurare la certezza della pena contenuti nel pacchetto sicurezza
7231405 spingiamo anche per un federalismo sulla sicurezza la chiave di volta quindi

7231407 una mia opinione personale che il testo potrebbe essere fornito dallistituto almeno per la scuola dellobbligo
7231408 se ne parli siamo disponibili facendo riferimento alle norme volute da falcone berlusconi ha iniziato con il piede giusto ci sono tante cose di cui dover parlare un argomento complesso per esempio c il tema della giustizia civile perch un imprenditore che non ha tempi certi per il soddisfacimento dei suoi crediti va in difficolt la competitivit del sistema economico legata anche a una giustizia che consenta di recuperare i propri crediti e di avere ragione in sede civile
7231409 noi siamo sempre stati a favore della separazione delle carriere si discuter di tutto
7231410 e una nostra vecchia idea secondo me ottima in prospettiva bossi lo ha sempre sostenuto limportante partire si discute di tutto e poi si arriva a una conclusione ma in questo momento noi siamo concentrati sul federalismo

7231429 tumours remain within the skin but can grow and become ulcerated
7231430 they can be painful and if close to the eye can have a significant effect on vision
7231431 at present muffins is below the eye and whilst it is relatively small it is not affecting his sight
7231432 however it is likely to be causing soreness and irritation and now that it has become ulcerated it is likely to attract flies
7231433 because treatment to date has not been successful for muffin we used a specialised technique known as brachytherapy which is a form of radiotherapy
7231434 i have inserted wires impregnated with a radioactive material iridium 192 into the affected area this is a gold standard of treatment particularly suited to this type of tumour
7231435 i am very hopeful that it will improve muffins quality of life significantly

7231479 moment mal w re das nicht konkurrenz wieso die news
7231480 das sind meistens o skills d h man kriegt sie ber items
7231481 ich habe gedacht das wieder 3000 leute gebannt wurden weil ich den satz nicht richtig gelesen habe ist jedem seine entscheidung ob man sich ne karte kauft
7231482 und selbst nach der erscheinung von diablo iii werden noch nicht alle fragen gekl rt sein
7231483 world of warcraft entwickelte sich in vielen bereichen aus diablo 2 aber es ben tigte nie ein battle net system um die community zusammen zu halten kannst du etwas dazu sagen wie diablo 3 in das neue battle net eingef gt wird
7231484 du erw hnst dass wow sich aus diablo 2 entwickelt hat
7231485 viele spiele versuchen sich an einem social networkaspekt so z b battlefield heroes k nnen wir so etwas auch f r das neue battle net erwarten
7231486 obwohl wir schon viel gesehen haben gerade auch im free to play sektor haben action rpgs stagniert seit diablo 2 kam wie f hlst du dich diablo 3 zu entwickeln in diesen zeiten
7231487 andere spiele haben auch versucht content zuf llig zu generieren aber ohne gro en erfolg wieso schafft diablo es dass das funktioniert
7231488 ich glaube ehrlich gesagt dass zuf lligkeit sehr schwer zu bewerkstelligen und sehr teuer ist und so zu einem bestimmten teil und ich hasse es es darauf zu beschr nken ist es ein problem der finanziellen ressourcen mehr als alles andere wenn man ein wirklich cooles dungeon macht ein dungeon von guter gr e muss man 12 bis 15 r ume gestalten vielleicht auch ein paar weniger sechs bis acht r ume k nnen einen spieler 15 bis 20 minuten kosten das ist eine gute zeit f r ein einziges level vielleicht wiederholt man es beim spielen ein paar mal so dass man auf 20 r ume kommt um dabei den eindruck eines zuf lligen dungeons zu erstellen muss man in etwa 80 r ume designen die per zufall eingebunden werden wenn man sich das genauer ansieht sieht man dass es vier bis f nfmal so viel arbeit am content ist und die erstellung von hintergrundcontent ist einer der gr ten flaschenh lse in der entwicklung von spielen wenn man sich spiele anschaut sieht man dass sie keine probleme haben charaktere zu erstellen animationen sind ein kleiner flaschenhals da man in aktuellen spielen so unfassbar viele animationen hat aber wenn man sich irgendeine spielefirma ansieht und dann schaut welche leute sie suchen ich weiss nicht ob es irgendeine firma gibt die nicht leute f r hintergrundcontent sucht hintergrund dessen ist dass es so unglaublich viel zu erstellen gibt aber die meisten leute viel lieber gro e imposante monster erschaffen als einen baum aber was w rden wir nicht alles f r jemanden geben der gut b ume erstellen kann leute die das k nnen sind ihr gewicht in gold wert
7231489 bevor es angek ndigt wurde war beinahe klar dass diablo 3 ein free to play game sein w rde das ist jetzt nichtmehr so habt ihr jemals anderweitige finanzierungsmodelle in betracht gezogen
7231490 die art wie wir die sache angehen ist wir machen das spiel das wir wollen wie es uns gef llt und dann denken wir ber ein finanzierungsmodell nach welches gut mit dem spiel funktioniert
7231491 hm microtransactions w rden uns einen haufen geld einbringen lasst uns einen weg finden das ins spiel zu bringen wenn es nicht passt
7231492 das ist ein service den wir anbieten wollen wie viel wird uns das kosten ok soviel wird es kosten also m ssen wir die kosten decken ist das ein service f r den man geld zahlen w rde
7231493 bisher gab es in den diablospielen nicht viel speziellen pvp content in wow hingegen habt ihr viel davon welche verbesserungen plant ihr f r pvp in diablo 3
7231494 wir h tten gerne einen speziellen pvp modus und wollen davon wegkommen dass spieler einfach wie in fr heren diablospielen pvp per knopfdruck aktivieren
7231495 micro transactions bezeichnet ein gesch ftsmodell im bereich der computerspiele bei diesem gesch ftsmodell wird meist das eigentliche spiel gratis angeboten der gewinn wird anschlie end durch das m glichst geschickte verkaufen von kleinen zusatzoptionen wie z b in einem rennspiel ein zus tzliches fahrzeug oder in einem shooter eine zus tzliche waffe
7231496 es gibt dinge die bernehmen wir vom starcraft team und sie bernehmen dinge von uns
7231497 aber m glicherweise wei nicht mal blizzard selbst wann genau diablo 3 heraus kommt
7231498 aufgrunddessen habe man sich bei blizzard zusammengefunden und noch einmal analysiert wie der platz in der messehalle f r die blizzcon am effizientesten genutzt werden k nnte dabei sind 3000 weitere tickets herausgekommen
7231499 um ehrlich zu sein es ist eine minderheit die den grafikstil nicht mag
7231500 die mehrheit der r ckmeldungen welche wir bekommen haben waren sehr zufrieden mit dem grafikstil ich denke wenn sie das fertige spiel sehen wird es ein wenig dunkler sein als die kritiker das zun chst angenommen haben was wir gezeigt haben ist der anfang des spiels in dem alles ein wenig heller und freundlicher ist wir wollen dass das spiel sich immer b ser und dunkler anf hlt je weiter es fortschreitet in bezug auf den grafikstil haben wir drei vollkommene neuanf nge gemacht bis wir zufrieden waren bei den vorherigen versuchen haben wir uns zu sehr an diablo 2 orientiert was diablo 3 langweilig machte da es sich so einfach nicht so gut spielte wie es sollte
7231501 an eine sache m chte ich erinnern leute die den grafikstil mit dem von diablo 2 vergleichen sind sehr w hlerisch mit den dingen an die sie sich erinnern sie denken da zum beispiel nur an ein paar dunkle gebiete in akt 1 oder akt 3 vergessen jedoch die hellen abschnitte wie die wiesen in akt 1 oder den kompletten zweiten akt welcher einer der beliebtesten ist das teilweise grelle u ere der monster lie sie herausstechen und diese sachen machten das spiel sehr gut allerdings wurden genau diese sachen beim bevorstehenden release von diablo 2 kritisiert das spiel sei zu hell und freundlich gewesen im vergleich zum ersten diablo nat rlich zeichnete das erste diablo rote linien um die monster so dass man sie berhaupt sehen konnte
7231502 viele leute w rden sagen das tr nkesystem ist ein kennzeichen der diabloserie
7231503 es ist perfekt alles was wir tun werden ist vielleicht ein paar kleinigkeiten zu ndern dinge die vielleicht nicht ganz so perfekt sind aber im gro en und ganzen lieben wir es im gegensatz zum kampf der so viel besser sein k nnte
7231504 das ziel ist es spieler dazu zu bringen eine f higkeit zu benutzen wo sie fr her einfach nur einen trank getrunken h tten das ziel ist es den spieler dazu zu bringen in monsterhorden zu rennen die ganze gruppe zu l hmen und sie dann zu umrunden um die rettende heilsph re zu erreichen oder ich l hme sie erschlage ein paar von ihnen in der hoffnung eine der heilsph ren zu bekommen sollte ich dann keine bekommen benutze ich halt einen anderen weg um mit der situation fertig zu werden
7231505 die eine gro artige sache ber die sich wohl niemand mit uns streiten wird ist dass gro e items im inventar f r ein besseres spielgef hl bez glich der items gesorgt haben
7231506 gro e sachen in diese tasche kleine in die andere
7231507 ich weiss nicht ob ich mir etwas vergleichbares denken kann aber das neue system ist ziemlich cool und ganz anders als alles was wir bisher hatten
7231508 ich denke nicht dass wir etwas wie die geheime zuflucht haben werden ich denke eher dass die bedrohung der man im fortschreitenden spielverlauf gegen bertritt viel h her ist als in den anderen diablospielen wenn man an den cinamatic trailer denkt wird man sehen dass es zuvor nie eine invasion in der welt von sanctuary gegeben hat aber wenn man sich den trailer ansieht glaube ich weiss man dass wir in diese richtung gegangen sind alles was im ersten diablo passiert ist war vom ausma sehr klein auch in diablo 2 verfolgt man diablo als ob man nur die folgen seiner anwesenheit beseitigt in lord of destruction war ein bisschen invasionscharakter zu sp ren baals invasion war ziemlich gro aber wir wollen deutlich mehr als das viel mehr kann ich nicht erz hlen ohne schl sselelemente der stpry zu verraten
7231509 ok ich h tte besser reagieren m ssen n chstes mal versuch ich die situation anders zu l sen
7231510 sch ner wirken lassen als es ist indem man ihm ein tolles bild gibt
7231511 ich will sie behutsam ber die heutigen zwei monate hinaus verl ngern

7231532 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7231533 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7231534 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

7231592 we did okay to a certain extent against villa but we need to be a bit more resolute
7231593 we have to make sure the pattern of play and the way we approach games is correct not just for 45 minutes or 60 minutes but for 90 minutes
7231594 that is what we are striving to achieve it is early days though and these things can take time
7231595 we worked extremely hard in pre season and are looking for a positive result from our first league game at home
7231596 mark knows what he is doing and he has been very successful i do not see that changing
7231597 once he gets bedded in at manchester city they will be a decent side
7231598 last season they finished in the top half and then came under pressure from injuries near the end so i am expecting them to do okay this year
7231599 scolaris been at the top of the tree and you have nothing but admiration for people who get there
7231600 hes been the national coach of brazil and won the world cup and this is what the premier league is all about we seem to have the best coaches and the best players now which is fantastic
7231601 it was close last year and im sure theyll be neck and neck again which way itll go will be like a toss of a coin but i believe man united are the team to beat after what they did last year
7231602 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me
7231603 i dont know if some clubs want shaun wright phillips in the last game he played 25 30 minutes and he has played for the second time in the first group of training i dont know what the player is thinking about with regards offers from other teams
7231604 if i have 24 25 players with me and three or four for every two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
7231605 i will not tell you how many brigades we have now

7231610 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined
7231611 we should find out first how big the fire is and how soon it will be extinguished in order to assess the damage
7231612 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7231613 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7231614 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7231615 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7231616 its important to understand though that the chinese economy is still growing at four five times the developed world and that each unit of growth consumes five times the units of metal that a similar pace of growth in the western world would consume

7231636 they were malandros so maybe they can talk to these malandros and tell them not to harm me
7231637 i also believe in the virgin mary and my other saints its just that these saints understand the street better
7231638 one day the santos malandros help a desperate mother keep her child off drugs the next day they help you score some cocaine its the duality of life but thats the way real life functions

7231688 now i have even started using numbers to manage my small business in my home when i am making local beverages previously i didnt know how much i had invested or how much i had sold now i can somewhat record and control how much i spent even if its just an ordinary calculation even if its just a small difference thats a huge difference for me
7231689 because i dont have land myself the only option i have is to be involved in this small business previously i had to go to loan providers even just to get a small amount of money it was difficult because you could not get money easily they would appoint you to come one day and when you went they would tell you to come back another day but now with the profit from my business i am paying into my loans principal and saving the excess profit as well
7231690 after worth i am now able to write my name in afaan oromo language my children are able to read afaan oromo script i am using my literacy knowledge during the kebele meeting and when the farmers association calls a meeting we use literacy at the clinic and hospital when we are paying and taking receipts we also use literacy for writing things in the court if two farmers are quarreling over a border they will go to the social court in our kebele the court then sends a letter to identify the case they must read the letter and sign it
7231691 after organizing into worth groups we have learned our rights and obligations we are learning through the program materials if we face a problem we ask each other questions then the whole class discussion clarifies the issue
7231692 after learning to read i have come to know my rights and obligations through different means i was in court for a land claim case and i was able to defend myself i sent my application to the kebele after identifying the receipts i took the receipts to the court this was taken as evidence i also witnessed different documents and because of this i won the case by looking at this evidence the court decided on my behalf and now everything is ok
7231693 before worth i was sending five children to school now i am sending an additional one none of my children are out of school now
7231694 tumours remain within the skin but can grow and become ulcerated
7231695 they can be painful and if close to the eye can have a significant effect on vision
7231696 at present muffins is below the eye and whilst it is relatively small it is not affecting his sight
7231697 however it is likely to be causing soreness and irritation and now that it has become ulcerated it is likely to attract flies
7231698 because treatment to date has not been successful for muffin we used a specialised technique known as brachytherapy which is a form of radiotherapy
7231699 i have inserted wires impregnated with a radioactive material iridium 192 into the affected area this is a gold standard of treatment particularly suited to this type of tumour
7231700 i am very hopeful that it will improve muffins quality of life significantly
7231701 as you may already know i lived for 16 months in east africa in a village of subsistence farmers
7231702 i was not an official member of any group but i was impressed by the content and use of lumasaba in this book so i asked nabutuwa teopista of the butemulani womens group to lend me her copy i then started my own worth group besides me are my daughters in law mutuwa scovia celina namweke nabuduwa jennipher and my grand children sarah mutonyi and wokunyanya malika a boy whom i teach lumasaba with the aid of this book
7231703 most of the women in this group are members of the league of the mercy church ministry and they had given up coming to worth group meetings for their church meetings but when i talked to them about the benefits of worth they started saving and now have 10 active members four members have taken loans totaling ushs 25 000 15 16usd and they have a balance of ushs 80 000 50 00usd in the cash box that they will loan out next week
7231704 my name is simiyu lusyana i am a 34 year old widow and a resident of bumuyonga village in namicha my husband died in 2005 leaving me with two children rebecca nderema and mary carolyn hatete aged 6 and 13 respectively life has been challenging from the time my husband died it has been hard to provide for my children in terms of clothing shelter and food it is not possible for me to go back to my parents in karamoja for help so i joined the worth program in my community meeting with the women in my group brings me encouragement and emotional support sometimes they even collect some extra money for me to use for feeding
7231705 god i dont want to loan them 10 i only have 50 left myself
7231706 yeah i know but you know i did die for you and i would really like it if you helped them out
7231707 ok so were here now how do we live here what are we supposed to do and how are we supposed to do it
7231708 god i dont know how i became a youth leader
7231709 she called in and said it wasnt going to work for her
7231710 thats great for a guy who basically gets paid to follow you but what about the rest of us what about those of us who have to work and take care of kids etc etc etc
7231711 saving with worth has been good for me because before i did not think it was possible
7231712 im happy to be part of my worth group because the other group members help each other learn literacy we also share business knowledge and experiences with each other and through this support we all get positive results together i learned how to read write add and subtract by using the first and second books in the worth series i have also learned about human trafficking and advocacy so i can protect myself my family and other people in my village i took a loan from my group to expand my dessert business last year my business was small i sold only one kind of desert and made only a small profit now because of the loan i got from my group i sell many kinds of desserts and i have more customers i have more profit which helps me support my family
7231713 through worth i have learned literacy and business skills and have a better understanding about womens issues in my local community such as human trafficking and domestic violence i now know ways to prevent them peacefully i have not taken a loan from my group yet but im proud that other women of my group have taken loans to run their small businesses and get more income to support their family because of worth i feel that i have a strong personality and can speak well in public my neighbors and other villagers admire me because im active in supporting others in my community i have a good reputation because of my experience in the worth womens group and my work in the community other villagers encouraged me to run as a candidate for the commune council election in 2007 i had great success and was elected as a commune councilor for my own commune i think that i will face many problems with my present position because im a member of the opposition party but i am committed to helping my group and community have a better future

7231762 by the time we get to the end of the season i should be able to answer that

7231799 oh its hot in here now its time to get naked
7231800 well its not your birthday so we dont need to worry about a set amount
7231801 theres just something so fucking sweet about orgasms from any sort of anal play i try to tell my friends i try to spread the good word but they dont want to hear it
7231802 how did you fit all your stuff into a backpack i must be doing something wrong
7231803 well you always pack too much but were only spending one night youre gonna be up there a for half a week
7231804 right good point but i still think im doing something wrong
7231805 you know as cramped and uncomfortable as the greyhound buses are those bastard nextels are not allowed like in when they keep kicking him off the bus and that low voice says no dogs allowed its a beautiful thing
7231806 whatever you just go back to stretching out those long legs of yours and see if you still feel like praising greyhound
7231807 so im standing in jeffersons apartment correction his empty apartment
7231808 i bet you do have fun and keep in touch
7231809 2 30 i think and youre hanging out at vivianes while shes here
7231810 yes thats the plan but if i dont hear from you by 5 00 im calling to warn you im on my way back to get ready for the concert
7231811 oh shes real sweet you should meet her actually you just might
7231812 oh meg im going to beat her now want to watch
7231813 you know meg theres time if you want a beatin of your own
7231814 save one for me id rather not be distracted and uncomfortable all through the concert
7231815 oh without a doubt though were not as dressed up as the rest of this audience
7231816 wait for it wait there it is youve gotta love those dueling tempos
7231817 you know my bed is much more comfortable than this couch
7231818 i feel like i should just sit back and watch you at work now
7231819 so i better fuck you now before its too late
7231820 im just taking the muffins from the oven where are you im eating without you
7231821 im sorry but im looking for something with a bigger engine
7231822 wait and really give my first go with everything i had in me
7231823 when the crowd was roaring for robert it made it a really difficult day for the opposition i would imagine
7231824 it is a powerful effect on teams theres no doubt about that and in that context it was always going to be difficult for whoever we played today
7231825 we didnt have anyone in the rooms before the game just to keep it pretty normal and when i ran out it really smacked me in the face a bit just to see all those guys there
7231826 i suppose i didnt expect that theyd get so many here they must be spread pretty far and wide now
7231827 the most important thing is that we delivered to the fans that we played good footy but it meant a lot and its something ill look back on a bit like my 350th
7231828 it was a really proud day and i had a lot of family here a lot of friends and it was great the fans have always been fantastic to me
7231829 obviously id like to go out playing as many games as i can and i still feel like we can do something in the finals
7231830 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment
7231831 ive been at this church for eight years and chris wanted to do this
7231832 wed welcome more anyone can volunteer through another church or just by contacting rye congregational
7231833 they also choose the site arrange our lodging and set up the dedication ceremony
7231834 within juarez there has been mounting violence between the drug cartel and the police and the murder rate as chronicled in the media has soared
7231835 so much that 35 volunteer groups planning on building in juarez cancelled their trip it put a real strain on casa por cristo we decided not to cancel we persevered the authorities had taken measures to limit travel in the city
7231836 there was a grandfather armando the father jaime cuenca de la parra the mother who was pregnant with her third child rosa elvira larreta frias and two children alejandro and emanuel
7231837 one child was in the hospital with respiratory problems it was vital that they receive that home
7231838 our church has set up an endowment to assure money for future years
7231839 one thing that strikes me is that we built this house in four days and no one got hurt no one got sick
7231840 there were a few small dings but everyone looked out for each other the two groups became one id hear people say you look hot go sit down theyd ask if others were drinking enough water because it was so hot
7231841 when we arrived we saw a lot of casa houses
7231842 diane worked with such compassion and integrity thats always been her skill
7231843 we look at disadvantaged residents of the keys towns and bring citizens together to express what they need
7231844 what if you have money but you have a disability the wealthy can be disadvantaged what if you are a wealthy woman but you have post partum depression what if toxins disadvantage you
7231845 we look at any keys resident struggling with a problem that has a community component and needs a community response not a portland answer not a portsmouth answer but an answer for the keys region
7231846 diane told us to not only look at the need but look at what the assets are we in the social services have a history of looking at need but diane said look at the assets because we have a lot of them
7231847 im not only talking about corporate entities who might make donations but people resources who are the people what are the assets of youth or our seniors or other targeted populations that we might not think to ask
7231848 raising children cooking getting everyone where they have to go is hard enough but what if she doesnt have a car what if shes being abused
7231849 we conducted long interviews and i learned how to listen how to see things from different sides and isnt that the basis of peace and not war seeing things from various perspectives
7231850 a lot of students dont want to be part of the drunk frat scene but dont know what else to do at orientation we told them if youre not attracted to the drinking scene we have an option for you
7231851 the feds were happy with it which kind of surprised me
7231852 i told them im not a medical person im not a hospital person
7231853 they said were hiring you to work in the community
7231854 unfortunately the area is seen as not maine and not new hampshire theres always been this split certain things were fully available for southern york county but a lot was not
7231855 in order to do what we were proposing there had to be a lot of facilitating a lot of communication we had to have people buy in and thats where she had strength
7231856 of all the things ive done in my life what we accomplished then was one of the more powerful examples of people who want to make a change creating a safe process to move improvements forward
7231857 and diane was at the center of it she was the glue that kept us all together we lived in fear of her leaving
7231858 the funding environment is less friendly right now for more creative holistic community based generalists like me
7231859 now you have to be specific if youre working organic matter into the garden and it helps everything in the garden thats a generalist if youre dealing with one crop and showing measurable improvements in the one crop you planted thats whats getting funding right now
7231860 ill be 63 in september for the last couple of years i was getting tired theres a physical and mental and emotional level that declines for most of us
7231861 im still intelligent and im still capable but having deadline deadline deadline made me ill its time to slow down
7231862 today people understand the concept of working together in a very real way because of diane
7231863 the fact is were much better off if we find common ground instead of looking for differences and she was very much a champion of common ground
7231864 the good thing is we can put ourselves in a position if we keep winning we dont have to rely on anyone else losing really
7231865 well do the same again next week weve got to reassess our injuries and weve shown all year that we play for each other no matter what weve gone through and that will be the case again next week
7231866 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has more international experience
7231867 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7231868 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7231869 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7231870 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7231871 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could ever put together
7231872 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7231873 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7231874 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7231875 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7231876 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7231877 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7231878 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7231879 im not sure the reason i feel bad because wyland does fabulous work but my hands are tied
7231880 the fund raising process actually sounds like its going to be a lot of fun because it sounds like theres a ton of support in the community
7231881 the committee continues to move forward as best we can but until we get that element worked out it will be difficult
7231882 the first meeting one gentleman showed who was as barber one is the director at odiorne point science center we have housewives administrative assistant computer execs its quite a full breadth of people
7231883 i cant pay it its not something feasible to me
7231884 thank god the first or second delivery is fuel assistance
7231885 well have to wait until the next administration takes office
7231886 we never turn anyone down we encourage anyone to come in
7231887 i guess i freeze i dont know im going to have to turn to the town im gong to have to turn to the state no idea i think congress and bush better come through with some additional funding i think theyve got to see the need
7231888 i really think this is going to be a major crisis this winter
7231889 theres going to be older people dying in their homes they have their pride and theres not enough aid for them it only takes one person to help another person hes just trying to keep his four walls and a roof
7231890 all my life what i dont know i want to know
7231891 we had been on the lookout for this vehicle since yesterday evening based on the report of a drunken driver at the wheel
7231892 we didnt find it until the crash was reported this morning
7231893 this arrest is the result of an extensive investigation by our detectives and dcyf
7231894 it began with a call to the residence several months ago
7231895 its the only sport where communication between two partners in this case the horse and the rider is the difference between success and a ride in the ambulance
7231896 theres no play book theres trust and intuition an almost telepathic trust that develops between a horse and rider thats almost impossible to put into words
7231897 you dont have to be an equestrian or know anything about show jumping to really enjoy yourself that sunday
7231898 this has got to be one of the most beautiful sports in the world right in their back yard in new hampshire people are going to see olympic caliber athletes youre going to see some of the premiere athletes not just from new england but literally the world
7231899 at this point in the season most of our horses are quite fit
7231900 you dont want to over jump and over use your horses you want to make sure your horse is fit enough so they can last just like any athlete the horses are athletes themselves
7231901 this saves the horses legs from jumping and the concussion of jumping
7231902 so the horses can just think about eating grass and being a horse thats important to keeping them fresh
7231903 when you go to the gym you use your first couple of minutes for stretching to get loose relaxed and limber
7231904 theyve got to really work hard and put their bodies in more difficult positions which definitely strains the muscles a little bit
7231905 theres no one horse thats the same you dont train one horse exactly the same you may have your own system but within that it goes to another level to how each horse is treated differently within that program
7231906 every horse that youre going to see walk into the ring sunday is worth more than your house some of them are worth as much as a small town
7231907 right off the bat theyre braver theyre probably more stubborn and more enthusiastic about life in general
7231908 theyre born into it most of them are offspring of other grand prix sires or mares they know exactly whats going on
7231909 they know the difference between the first round and the jump off
7231910 when the jump off tone rings theyre wild its a spectacular thing to see
7231911 its just a whole bunch of little things that started adding up
7231912 i didnt get a sense i was accomplishing anything anymore
7231913 we spoke with his wife and i know he suffered several compound fractures to a leg and arm
7231914 i think he will not be arriving today let us go in and finish preparing our supper
7231915 this is rather big for the two of us is it not my love
7231916 there will be plenty left over for findar to when he arrives tomorrow it will be just as good cold served with jellied vegetables
7231917 we have this one night to be together let us not waste it
7231918 if we were not we would not have known atar nor the beautiful life that we shared in tirion before the horrors occurred
7231919 it is only convention that brothers may not love we know our love is pure and true and that we need each other terribly here drink this wine and let us enjoy this night without worry
7231920 good because the more relaxed you are the better i will enjoy you
7231921 come let us go into the parlor where we shall be more comfortable we will be able to smell when the roast is ready from there
7231922 what are you going to do nelyo i thought you wanted to kiss me
7231923 you are hungry you shall have me undone ere long if you are not careful
7231924 i shall have you on the sofa brother and after dinner i shall ravish you in my bed
7231925 ah it has been too long since i looked upon your beauty
7231926 if your guilt did not stand in the way most of the time take off your clothes maitimo
7231927 it does not matter who you are to me it is what you are
7231928 come now and finish me and then we can go and have our supper we will need our strength for later tonight
7231929 maitimo my love let me bring you to completion as you did me
7231930 turko and the others would feel that what we do now with each other is completely wrong especially turko he would think that we make a travesty and mockery of the family
7231931 what we do in private with each other is no concern of theirs
7231932 they need never know we harm no one by what we do
7231933 let us go upstairs we will bring a bottle of brandy with us and we can relax in the bath until we feel sleepy and then we can go to bed
7231934 would you like me to try to plait this with my one hand
7231935 let us get under the covers like we used to do when we were young
7231936 i was thinking of the first time we did this
7231937 the first time we slept together or made love to each other
7231938 i forget who made the first overture do you remember macalaur
7231939 no one made the first move we came together spontaneously our lips met and once we felt and tasted each other we were lost we were young and our flesh did not take long to grow heated
7231940 i remember that i was the first to put my hand upon your beautiful hardness before you touched my more modest length
7231941 i turned toward you when you took your hand away i wanted to feel it again where you had placed it and i remember tearing at your nightshirt lifting it up so roughly that i might see your erection grow before my eyes while i stroked it and i tore the hem of your shirt in my haste
7231942 that was the most exciting night i had ever experienced i dreamed about it for years afterwards and pleasured myself to that memory many times
7231943 you were so slender then your skin was so soft
7231944 and your taste was exquisite to me like honey and when i looked upon your face as i do now you were so beautiful
7231945 we are both beautiful are we not we might be taken for maidens
7231946 we may be pretty but we cannot be maidens with these things that dangle so wantonly between our legs
7231947 mine cannot stay soft when it is near you and wishes that it could be sheathed in your tight heat
7231948 and what of mine mine all but swells to impossible size at the thought of your perfectly shaped buttocks
7231949 between my round buttocks or does it wish my lips to sheathe it again
7231950 i cannot i am much heavier and i am afraid of hurting you
7231951 i want to be able to see your face and the rest of your body when i take you now raise your hips
7231952 i want to ram my stiff member into you so hard it will make you sing even louder
7231953 methinks the memory of this encounter shall linger for a long while
7231954 weather is a literary specialty and no untrained hand can turn out a good article on it
7231955 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
7231956 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
7231957 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
7231958 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
7231959 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country

7231968 il concetto moderno di sovranit un principio antropocentrico elaborato e organizzato in riferimento ai soli esseri umani anche se si tratta di un presupposto di ordine quasi metafisico lantropocentrismo di importanza pratica considerevole che permette agli stati moderni di ottenere il consenso e la lealt dei loro cittadini alfine di realizzare i loro progetti politici tuttavia i suoi limiti che appaiono evidenti quando si constata che in maniera autoritaria si imposto un tab su tutto il dibattito serio riguardanti gli ufos gli ufos non sono stati mai studiati sistematicamente dalla scienza n dalle autorit perch a tuttoggi abbiamo considerato che non possono essere di origine extraterrestre in realt noi non sappiamo niente e questo rende questo tab intrigante perch la possibilit aliena non pu essere esclusa in seguito ai lavori di giorgio agamben michel foucault e jacques derrida si giustifica questa ambiguit per gli imperativi pratici della sovranit antropocentrica che non pu essere risolta al proclamo di una eccezione aliena a questo antropocentrismo evitando la possibilit di accettarlo non si pu andare avanti in tema ufo eludendo la questione della sua natura
7231969 i dirigenti si rifiutano di discutere il fenomeno ufo per paura di scoprire la sua vera natura e per questo che preferiscono guardare altrove semplicemente lo ignorano e ci impedisce loro di prendere delle decisioni in merito
7231970 in june and july we thought we had reached the bottom of the market then the government goes and does this and makes things even worse august was expected to be bad but the general view among agents across the country is that they are seeing 20 fewer new buyers in the market than they had expected at the start of the month
7231971 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7231972 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7231973 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7231974 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7231975 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7231976 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7231977 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region

7232003 when the crowd was roaring for robert it made it a really difficult day for the opposition i would imagine
7232004 it is a powerful effect on teams theres no doubt about that and in that context it was always going to be difficult for whoever we played today
7232005 we didnt have anyone in the rooms before the game just to keep it pretty normal and when i ran out it really smacked me in the face a bit just to see all those guys there
7232006 i suppose i didnt expect that theyd get so many here they must be spread pretty far and wide now
7232007 the most important thing is that we delivered to the fans that we played good footy but it meant a lot and its something ill look back on a bit like my 350th
7232008 it was a really proud day and i had a lot of family here a lot of friends and it was great the fans have always been fantastic to me
7232009 however we have no problem with the tournament being shifted to sri lanka either

7232042 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain the results of this study reveal that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine this means that patients could have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain
7232043 im very much looking forward to seeing it again as i havent seen it for at least two years when my cottage in the new forest caught fire there were 50 firemen trying to put it out but they couldnt stop it
7232044 when i came home i thought the gardener was having a big bonfire but then when i drove closer i realised the whole place was ablaze
7232045 i was told my wife was inside so i rushed into the garage grabbed a ladder and smashed a window so i could go in and get her
7232046 i never knew smoke could be so thick it was almost as if it was alive it was frightening
7232047 i had never been to herne bay but my producer suggested it as a location
7232048 i spent a couple of weeks there adapting the screenplay and finding everything i needed
7232049 i dont remember much about the town although i do recall it had the second longest pier in the country i was sad to hear it was lost in a storm
7232050 we were treated very well and had lots of people who were willing to be extras for us so im looking forward to seeing what it is like these days herne bay holds a special place in my heart but i havent been able to visit until now

7232056 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7232057 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7232058 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7232059 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7232060 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7232061 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7232062 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7232063 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7232064 student led collaborative inquiry and involvement enlists their enthusiasm in ways that even very good lectures and texts dont
7232065 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7232066 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7232067 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7232068 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7232069 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7232070 people call to get the order forms for the next years camp before they even are printed
7232071 whats unique about them is that they really see the heart of the patient
7232072 they say we dont know if we can get that
7232073 looking back on it i dont think we figured it would turn into what its turned into
7232074 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7232075 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7232076 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7232077 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7232078 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7232079 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7232080 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7232081 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7232082 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7232083 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7232084 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7232085 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7232086 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7232087 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7232088 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7232089 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7232090 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7232091 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country

7232096 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink

7232099 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7232100 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7232101 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7232102 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7232103 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7232104 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7232105 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7232106 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7232107 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7232108 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7232109 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7232110 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7232111 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7232112 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7232113 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7232114 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7232115 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7232116 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7232117 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7232118 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7232119 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7232120 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7232121 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7232122 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7232123 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7232124 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7232153 because there were actually still other medications that we hadnt tried yet
7232154 theres no big drug company behind it and there probably can never be unless somebody starts marketing sausage and eggs with cream sauce on it as a drug
7232155 make the other person feel important and do it sincerely
7232156 i was recently featured in a short post on the wall street journals blog where i talked about a few ways to raise your
7232157 web based pr communicate your expertise to your market via the internet
7232158 so many people who are real experts including authors professionals of all kinds and private practitioners have important messages that they want the public to know about unfortunately they concentrate mainly on the mainstream media and often ignore some very wonderful and effective online promotional methods simply because they dont know how to use them
7232159 these online promotional methods have been very effective in promoting my own blogs as well as my clients websites i am delighted to be sharing these techniques with other experts

7232162 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7232163 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7232164 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7232165 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7232166 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7232167 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7232168 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7232169 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7232170 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7232171 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7232172 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7232173 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7232174 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7232175 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7232176 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7232177 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7232178 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7232179 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7232180 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7232181 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7232182 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7232183 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7232184 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7232185 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7232186 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7232187 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7232188 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7232189 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7232190 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7232191 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7232192 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7232193 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7232194 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7232195 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7232196 das ist glattes lohndumping und das werden wir nicht dulden
7232197 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7232198 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7232199 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7232200 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7232201 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7232202 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7232203 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7232204 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7232205 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7232206 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7232207 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7232208 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7232209 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7232210 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7232211 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7232212 georgian corporals and sergeants train with germans alpine units and the navy work with french instructors and special operations and urban warfare troops are taught by israelis
7232213 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7232214 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7232215 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7232216 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7232217 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7232218 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7232219 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7232220 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7232221 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7232222 who are open to doing something on the production side
7232223 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7232224 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7232225 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7232226 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7232227 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7232228 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7232229 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7232230 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7232231 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7232232 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7232233 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7232234 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7232235 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7232236 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7232237 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7232238 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7232239 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7232240 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7232241 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7232242 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7232243 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7232244 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7232245 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7232256 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
7232257 if it is the latter and the americans are not able to convince them otherwise then the deal looks very difficult from now on
7232258 they took my music books and my daughters coloring books
7232259 we believe that mr tenenbaum was subjected to unusual and unwelcome scrutiny because of his faith and ethnic background a practice that would undoubtedly fit a definition of discrimination whether actionable or not
7232260 we will certainly review the issues raised in the dod inspector generals review for any procedures and policies that may need to be addressed or other steps that we should take to address the situation
7232261 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7232262 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7232263 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7232264 weve always had to overcome this idea that were not big enough or important enough to even be part of the national political landscape
7232265 that was part of the idea behind wanting to get the convention in the first place if people see colorado and the western spirit theyll get past all of that

7232270 was concerned with the impact that hunters lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination
7232271 biden told lotito that in light of these concerns his brother had asked him to seek lotitos assistance in finding employment for hunter in a non lobbying capacity
7232272 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7232273 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7232274 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7232275 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events
7232276 we worked so hard and the virginia maryland and d c potomac primaries were the beginning of his momentum that carried him through
7232277 it was just an amazing day for all of us
7232278 we feel a special sense of pride because we gave him the momentum he needed
7232279 every time i see obama he mentions something about how that was such a big day for him
7232280 he mentions the tremendous group of victories in maryland d c and virginia he will not forget us
7232281 i think the decisiveness of his victory was a big part in creating the conventional wisdom that we wouldnt be able to catch up with him
7232282 the clinton campaign probably thought feb 5 was going to be the knockout blow and then one week later to have such a clear group of states going obamas way really helped
7232283 we had done good door knocking and had strong visibility
7232284 to me it was kind of a fait accompli we had a business execution and i felt like if we executed wed win all 144 precincts
7232285 it was one message that had to reach any number of devices
7232286 i didnt really mind not getting it but i do know people who got it at 3 a
7232287 said sifry co founder of tech president a group blog covering the intersection of politics and technology
7232288 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7232289 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7232290 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7232291 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7232292 im unlikely to see another nation come to maturity like china has with this olympics
7232293 theyre really staging this its really choreographed its not sustainable
7232294 but theres a lot that is fake its lost a lot of its unique character
7232295 i constantly get the feeling that i shouldnt say anything that could be a slur against china i feel a lot of pressure to get the image
7232296 id like to come back after the olympics and see what its really like
7232297 if brazil had a stronger central government wed probably avoid a lot of anarchy like robberies and people being kidnapped
7232298 a lot of people who wouldnt come to china will consider it now
7232299 it does bring the country into the fold of the international community
7232300 i asked her how could someone burn their own history

7232310 georgia has stood for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7232311 which eventually attain policy dynamics of their own and become a burden on the government and or confuse the policy making process
7232312 georgia is a semi democracy we have traded one kind of semi democratic system for another there is a real need to understand that what happened is another one party government emerged
7232313 uncertain democracy u s foreign policy and georgias rose revolution
7232314 if we declare victory prematurely as i think the bush administration has done it is not good for democracy generally and not good for georgia in particular
7232315 relative to its self image and the way it is portrayed in the united states georgia is not a pristine democracy
7232316 has not even come close to finishing its democratic evolution it still has a long way to go on many fronts and we are committed to helping georgia move even deeper in its democratic evolution
7232317 i was excited to go to georgia i thought it had real prospects
7232318 but i couldnt have been more disappointed in terms of being able to accomplish anything
7232319 georgia has made enormous strides in governmental reform but must improve the effectiveness of key institutions strengthen political pluralism and increase public participation to truly consolidate its democratic gains
7232320 i back the bnps manifesto completely the country is full up theres too many people here its time to shut the door on immigrants immigration isnt helping crime rates drop thats for sure i served in the army it was about fighting communism because communists stopped freedom of speech im fighting for the same with the bnp this is a christian country islam is not compatible with this country

7232323 bnps dennis pearce unbowed as media try to character assassinate him
7232324 the new regime does not apply to marriages by banns common licence or special licence which probably explains the substantial increase in demand for bishops common licenses
7232325 it is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is significant abuse of the availability of church of england marriage in order to try to gain some immigration advantage
7232326 ive experienced a large rise in the number of people coming to me asking for a church wedding
7232327 at least one of the proposed partners tends not to be an english speaker they always want to be married as soon as possible its outrageous
7232328 400 increase in bogus marriages being carried out by anglican church
7232329 im afraid were going to see a lot more borrowing and spending
7232330 it is one reason why the bank of england is reluctant to cut interest rates they want to see the colour of the governments money

7232341 the great majority of athletes had the opportunity to compete at their best and they did so
7232342 i have immense pride in the performances of these athletes an outstanding performance
7232343 the poise and the focus of matthew and what he achieved was simply outstanding
7232344 we dont have as great issues as we had here
7232345 we knew the heat and humidity and pollution and those things were going to be a big issue
7232346 we are used to competing in great britain all of our sports do it regularly
7232347 and the other great advantage that we have is that many of our sports have a base in europe from which they can move across to london close to the games
7232348 well we shouldnt be scared of competition i think we should be very pleased to be engaging with china in sport
7232349 a legacy of these games is that australians must have a better understanding of china
7232350 there would have been a lot of perceptions that would have been blown away
7232351 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7232368 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7232369 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7232370 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7232371 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7232445 the last two times we hired a ceo we messed up we didnt vet the candidates properly and wound up with poop in our faces so this time were being more careful considering that spitzer won 6 gold medals as an olympic swimmer id say thats a good starting point

7232494 the thing i fear for you most is following desires and having extensive hopes about this worldly life following ones desires blocks you from the truth and having extensive hopes makes you forget the hereafter verily this worldly life is departing and the hereafter is approaching and each of them has its children so be children of the hereafter not children of this world for today there are opportunities to do deeds and there is no reckoning but tomorrow there will be reckoning and no deeds
7232495 extensive hopes about this worldly life give rise to lethargy when it comes to acts of obedience procrastinating with repentance desire for worldly things forgetfulness of the hereafter and hardness of the heart because the softness of the heart and its purity only comes about by remembering death the grave reward and punishment and the horrors of the hereafter if one remembers death he strives to do acts of obedience his worries decrease and he is satisfied with less

7232502 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7232503 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7232504 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7232505 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses

7232514 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
7232515 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
7232516 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
7232517 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
7232518 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
7232519 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
7232520 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
7232521 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
7232522 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
7232523 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods

7232589 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7232590 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7232591 the events of the past two weeks have been a disaster for us foreign policy
7232592 russias invasion of its neighbour is a clear demonstration that the us led effort to integrate postsoviet russia into the west has failed
7232593 a cold war mentality will strengthen on both sides the georgians hope to integrate quickly with europe and nato has been at best set far back
7232594 we are de facto in an escalation game with the russians that they appear to be winning
7232595 has shown little interest in foreign affairs and has made no significant contribution regarding the crisis in georgia
7232596 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7232597 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7232598 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7232599 if at all we have threats from any quarter its from indian forces
7232600 the government is unnerved by the nonviolent mass uprising and is now trying to use its old tactic to try to break the will of people
7232601 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7232602 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7232603 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7232604 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7232605 it would be difficult to discuss national targets for ghg gas reductions before the next us administration is in place
7232606 the reluctance against the sectoral approach has a more political origin and a substantive one
7232607 we have to see if that is something that can be captured as a sectoral approach under the un convention
7232608 why should a un official be commenting on what india should commit to or not or possible outcomes earlier too at bali in december key developing countries had complained about a bias in the secretariat
7232609 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7232610 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7232611 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7232612 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7232613 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7232614 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7232615 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7232616 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7232617 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7232618 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7232619 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7232620 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7232621 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7232622 we will surely try to bring the boats back again
7232623 the goal is to open a route between cyprus and gaza
7232624 people here are just ecstatic to see that someone cares
7232625 proves that your goal is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
7232626 we knew they were looking for a media provocation on the high seas
7232627 so we decided not to let them have the confrontation they wanted
7232628 kansas pharmacies play an important role in protecting the health and well being of kansans
7232629 most pharmacies take this responsibility seriously it is absolutely critical that all pharmacies perform their duties ethically with the best interests of their patients in mind
7232630 the authorities should be congratulated for their efforts in investigating this case and prosecuting the guilty parties
7232631 but what about the 100 000 infected computers that were unwillingly turned into foot soldiers for this criminal scheme while catching the bad guys is the first step its essential that these innocent victims also clean up their pcs without this its likely theyll just be playing a waiting game until another hacker exploits their lack of security and recruits them to another zombie network
7232632 im all for federal funding of faith based partnerships when the money is given to established social service agencies that can then partner with local congregations
7232633 small churches cant handle the incredible amount of groundwork that needs to be done in order to provide community services
7232634 run counter to the thinking of the bush faith based initiative the core of which obama would build on we found that the community is the place where everything must center and that mainline community organizations like the united way not small start up organizations are better suited to address multi faceted community problems
7232635 our research goal is to help community leaders match resources to needs
7232636 these findings mirror emerging research elsewhere and the ones i uncovered in greensboro in the 1990s delaware is not an anomaly a new initiative could use federal dollars to help community stewards strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones
7232637 ob nun pr sident rainer brechtken oder ein anderer das kann jeder machen der verantwortung in diesem verband tr gt
7232638 es war von beiden seiten ungl cklich hier in peking diesen streit loszubrechen hier kann man keine struktur politik machen oder ber ver nderungen im trainings ablauf reden
7232639 ich war lange genug turner und wei was es hei t wenn nicht alle tr ume reifen der verband ist ungl cklich mit dem ergebnis aber auch fabian und sein umfeld haben sicher mehr erwartet
7232640 er wird schon sehen dass wir k nftig immer mehr unser ding machen werden ich werde nicht von a nach b rumtanzen
7232641 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7232642 the salaries our members earn in the coastguard agency are significantly behind those within the other emergency services
7232643 it is not for me to make these decisions but there have been such spectacular successes that the honours system is bound to recognise them and will do
7232644 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london
7232645 its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7232646 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7232647 it will consider the results of the olympics and paralympics as well as other achievements in the wider sporting world over the past year
7232648 it will be a different olympics an olympics which will try to reach out to more and more people throughout the world
7232649 and as we move up to it we want more and more young people in britain interested in sport and that is why we will be investing more in sport in our schools as well as for our elite athletes

7232659 you let him get settled down its going to be a long day

7232661 weve got some chance here to catch these guys red sox so we want to put the best possible group out there we can right now
7232662 i think against oakland four starts back it looked like he was starting to turn the corner
7232663 but he struggled throwing strikes in boston last sunday with a 10 run lead thats not him
7232664 we just want to give him a couple of starts at triple a to see if he can get his mechanics back together
7232665 i guess im getting an opportunity to play and im getting away from all the lies that ive been told up to this point
7232666 the toronto argonauts would like to thank michael bishop for his years of service and contributions to our team we wish him well with this new opportunity in saskatchewan
7232667 you know what youre going to do going into the season and you cant have two starters
7232668 everything that was said in training camp was a lie
7232669 they asked me to give up arena football and be part of their program which i did and i came in and they put me behind damon allen
7232670 i gave up a lot for this organization and in return this is what im getting
7232671 im not the reason theyre 3 5 i think a lot of blame was put on me because i guess a lot of the guys wanted me to be in there
7232672 its not kerrys fault the problem comes from the top of the organization
7232673 ill definitely be looking forward to playing out there and helping them in any way i can

7232676 two things that boy did have were rhythm and determination no matter how many times i locked him out of the house or put a sold sign out on the lawn before he came home from school he would just bonk his head on the door until we let him in
7232677 i got these two diamond spikes through my upper lip going all the way into my mouth to make me look like a sexy walrus theyre putting a walrus in a prison full of hungry polar explorers
7232678 were artists and artists are sensitive and love to hug i wasnt surprised at all when hed rap about being faithful until the end of time and then go right back to rapping about murder what no i dont see the contradiction at all ill tell you what i did see i saw a man under tremendous pressure to determine when he felt like working receive millions of dollars a year and have tons of women trying to sleep with him all the time
7232679 i saw a man constantly being pushed by the media and by society to drive his ferrari around the city and spend three weeks a year recording an album when youre an artist like he was of course youll be conflicted he was a complex guy his love songs revealed his gentle good side while his harder songs showed that he could bleep a bleep bleep when he had to completely original you tell me what other hip hop artist has done that
7232680 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare
7232681 the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night
7232682 if a face and a voice can help spread the message then im more than happy to be that face and voice

7232695 six main things to consider when buying a reseller hosting package
7232696 they took some great shots and were great on offense but we came out a little flat at the beginning of the game
7232697 a lot of my ideas come from just the news i am kind of a news junkie
7232698 the social aspects of the pool tied with the visual aspects of the pool
7232699 i thought it was a really nice allegory for something that is socially more sad or melancholy
7232700 its not expensive when you compare it to the cost of having people running around on the ground looking for it
7232701 preparing for kindergarten can be a challenging job for the family
7232702 but this is a real great time for us our little girl is growing up
7232703 we always try to give parents the most information possible to ease their worries
7232704 if parents act excited about school then the child is going to feel the same if they act nervous the child will be nervous also
7232705 it can be the wonder years or it can be some of the worst years depending on who your friends are
7232706 parents have got to realize these are very transitional years for their children
7232707 kids at this age are going through emotional changes hormonal changes social changes it seems all at one time during these years
7232708 there are great teachers at kraemer and the curriculum is great it seems like a really fun school
7232709 its not a big scary thing it seems like the next logical step
7232710 we participated in those things we were invited to to make sure we had a good feel for the school and what the teachers concentrated on
7232711 parents try to be their kids super pal buddy buddy and not set guidelines
7232712 are testing their boundaries kids at this age are like a wet bar of soap if you squeeze them too much theyll shoot right out of your hands freedom is earned at this age its not given automatically
7232713 i always tell parents to make your home the center of your kids lives instead of having them spend hours and hours at johnnys house have johnny come over to your house and see what their friends are like
7232714 you bring your baby in and youre like oh my gosh
7232715 im just hoping hes not going to feel peer pressure
7232716 being a young ninth grader hes going to have a hard time socially because he is one of the younger students there are freshmen who are 14 and 15
7232717 i wish we wouldnt have started him early so we had the extra year
7232718 ive been very involved the past few years in everything and now going to high school i dont know hes becoming a lot more independent
7232719 parents have to be more of an invisible safety net in high school
7232720 they might be volunteering in the snack bar or hiding behind a pillar at the dance but kids need to know that mom and dad are still there even if kids act like they dont want them there
7232721 a lot of it will be my family theyre going to keep me in the right direction
7232722 i just have to keep my head up high im a strong willed person and i know what i want to do
7232723 i dont want to pressure her and be in her face every day
7232724 we have tried to instill values and morals we have as parents but ultimately at some point shes going to make her own decisions all we can do is be there for her
7232725 they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
7232726 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time
7232727 i was surprised to find that two large groups of non viewers were exceedingly different in many ways but shared commonalities regarding television
7232728 very strong opinions not only about television but also about those issues they saw as being associated with it such as politics and couple interaction
7232729 by researching families without television i think we learn a lot about the role of television in the lives of american families
7232730 i know this may sound counter intuitive but when we look closely at family interaction in the absence of tv we see the ways in which television has become an integral part of our lives
7232731 i read an article that said the thing soldiers serving in iraq and afghanistan missed most was coffee so customers of the long beach store bought one pound bags that we sent to troops through
7232732 go into a store and read some of the messages customers have written
7232733 its not whether you support the war its supporting the troops
7232734 that first year my team members sent coffee and got great letters of appreciation back
7232735 sgt matt schroeder sent us an e mail and photo of his friends and him enjoying our coffee the company uses that on the poster promoting the campaign and every time i see it it sends chills up my back
7232736 rocky and everyone at the coffee bean amp tea leaf
7232737 well i have never shaved of my eyebrows before wonder what that would look like
7232738 es gibt eine klare empirische evidenz daf r dass leute anfangen intensiver nach wegen aus der arbeitslosigkeit zu suchen wenn sie an die schwelle kommen an der die sozialtransfers drastisch gek rzt werden
7232739 die akzeptanzl hne der arbeitslosen haben sich deutlich nach unten bewegt
7232740 wir werden leistungen des staates k rzen eigenverantwortung f rdern und mehr eigenleistung von jedem einzelnen abfordern m ssen
7232741 der sockel ist geschrumpft selbst die problemgruppen haben dieses mal vom aufschwung am arbeitsmarkt profitiert
7232742 deswegen sind in diesem aufschwung auch wieder arbeitspl tze f r geringqualifizierte entstanden
7232743 the investigators have one key suspicion it is that the russian forces that left there two days ago have left a mine on the railroad
7232744 about a week ago on the same railroad a major bridge was exploded by the russian invaders and as they have left the area they have left mines
7232745 when it went off it was the loudest explosion ive ever heard the force was so great that some of the wagons were forced off the tracks
7232746 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7232747 insisted on the importance of a rapid pullout of russian soldiers present on the poti senaki route
7232748 im off to extinguish my life before i hit 28 just like you and scores of other drug addled musicians now stop distracting me with stupid questions while im trying to immortalise myself
7232749 what an idiot you had everything and you threw it away
7232750 why the hell did you blow your brains out you had a one year old daughter
7232751 ill fated stars whose lives have been tragically cut short at the age of 27
7232752 does a nihilistic instinct kick in at the age 27
7232753 jim morrison and brian jones both spookily died on july 3
7232754 its better to burn out rather sic than fade away
7232755 seems to me that here was a guy who had everything and was miserable about it and we had fuck all and i still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin thing ever
7232756 i cant have people like cobain coming over here on smack fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die thats fucking rubbish kids dont need to be hearing that nonsense
7232757 the visionary lies to himself the liar only to others
7232758 we are making these peep show machines and selling a lot of them at a good profit if we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about 10 of them in the whole united states with that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everyone in the country and then it would be done lets not kill the goose that lays the golden egg
7232759 as i drove through the gates to lucas 4 700 acre homestead on a brilliantly sunny saturday in late april i wasnt sure who else would be there but id been told that for the first conference lucas had organized two years earlier steven spielberg martin scorsese and francis ford coppola had all made the trip i was nervous and i had no idea about the dress code auteur casual
7232760 innovators feel in any industry when they try to introduce a new idea instead of being thrown a ticker tape parade theyre often met with hostility or indifference sometimes the status quo defeats the innovative concept or at least delays its introduction
7232761 although it may have a slightly higher glam factor than say the insurance business hollywood is a perfect case study for the way that any big successful well established industry responds to new ideas
7232762 business casual in the workplace has really opened up the blur in gender lines
7232763 the ability for both men and women to dress down at work is presenting more options for wardrobing
7232764 they are going for womens bags in dark colored leather
7232765 our preliminary data on alzheimers disease patients are promising as we observed beneficial effects after a single session of transcranial direct current stimulation
7232766 suggesting that chronic daily application might induce even greater improvement
7232767 our studies encourage broader research programs using different stimulation protocols and longer clinical follow up to clarify the impact this therapy might have on patients daily functional activities
7232768 we are assessing possible long lasting effects of electrical stimulation in alzheimers disease patients using repeated session protocols in a larger sample with longer clinical follow up
7232769 we believe that the best results especially in alzheimers disease patients could be obtained by combining transcranial direct current stimulation with cognitive rehabilitation
7232770 atentos a la forma de ir en una moto que tienen
7232771 come magnify the lord with me let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he answered me he delivered me from all my fears those who look to him are radiant their faces are never covered with shame this poor girl called and the lord heard me he saved me out of all my troubles taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him fear the lord you his saints for those who fear him lack nothing the lions may grow weak and hungry but those who seek the lord shall not be in want of any good thing as the older translation says
7232772 but as for me it is good to be near god i have made the sovereign lord my refuge i will tell of all your deeds
7232773 it doesnt run out of features and functions after only a few weeks of use
7232774 when you think about what you pay designers and construction workers and also the time costs and the inevitable construction delays this became the most affordable choice
7232775 its not like before when you could rent space while you were asleep at the switch
7232776 we have to keep a close eye on the situation
7232777 its too soon to speculate what the widespread effect will be but regardless we still have ample airlift into and out of new york city
7232778 the difference is huge if you have to fly through dallas or chicago
7232779 you start to ask yourself if the size of the client relationship justifies the emotional and financial cost of the trip
7232780 if its mostly seniors flying to florida expecting 200 fares those flights are going to get cut
7232781 i am reading the return of the native poor hardy if only he could have once seen the hand of god
7232782 i enjoyed the movie very much so many unexpected twists and turns but i came away thinking this is what our world would almost look like without the presence of the holy spirit
7232783 the tragic lines of egden heath form patterns which resist any idea of the working of the will
7232784 your emotions were likely assaulted in a thoroughly post modern way and it will take your rational mind a week to sort out what the movie was actually trying to say
7232785 when i first saw that everything in the old testament is pointing to a child the one who is coming it blew me away
7232786 and what can we learn from david about how god wants us to behave
7232787 sin is crouching at your door just like it did at cains and it wants to have you but you must master it
7232788 after outlining israels history we learn these things took place as examples for us that we might not desire evil as they did
7232789 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
7232790 there were so many moments along the way where you just wonder how youre going to actually achieve what you set out to do
7232791 to sit here and think this is actually accomplished is magical its unreal
7232792 this is an absolute perfect cap for whats happening at columbus circle
7232793 the area is very important to the city and this building will finish it
7232794 but even in an economically challenging time most people will still have 15 to go to a museum
7232795 even though we would have preferred to keep the old building we still hoped the new building would turn out really good
7232796 but whats there now looks like an appliance its an embarrassment
7232797 but the main thing is to be reviewed in the press and to have people think this is an interesting place
7232798 general opinion in the party is in favour of parting ways
7232799 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7232800 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7232801 i am also willing to contest the presidential election but i am bound to obey what the party decides
7232802 umm yes mam you are right i shall start the exercise right away but then lets look around in india the protocol is english lets begin with our school admission form my fathers driving license is in english the website for filing income tax return is in english look around you names of most hotels in the city shopping stores and malls hoardings most of these spelled in english so whats the point in learning a language that is on the verge of a deliberate ignorance
7232803 if we dont practice preach or speak in hindi wheres the fault of the language it is our misfortune that we have failed to respect our national language if you accuse the rest of the country for being so pro english what have you done to prevent this trend
7232804 ask your dad whats his favourite song i bet it will be in hindi ask your gang of friends in which language have they composed their theme song hindi lets ask the school administrator why does he have to keep hindi as a compulsory subject in his english medium school he could have opted for french or german the idea is not about using hindi but having to respect it there are a few people who will admit they like hindi i have a problem with this attitude you speak hindi at home or not doesnt matter but if you do then learn to admit it proudly own it
7232805 i cant believe this adi you cant just give it up like this come on you gotta fight for it
7232806 i agree with him we must confront the principal and make her understand nobody likes the usual 15 th august speech people hoot they dont care because year after year we just keep telling them the same old story we never present realities we serve them clich s
7232807 i understand guys what bothers me is not the hooting but the fact that how can the management just mercilessly censor my speech which was prepared for the independence day i mean look at the irony you are not free to express what you want to on your countrys independence day
7232808 look adi lets give it a last try come with me
7232809 sirs meet the green house captain aditi sports in charge gurpreet and discipline in charge priya
7232810 mam please tell me one thing honestly when you were in school did you ever enjoy the speeches of the chief guests on 15
7232811 i shall be honest with you son no i never enjoyed those speeches
7232812 because i used to think they all had to say the same thing and we as kids were bored of those monotonous speeches
7232813 and still mam you let the same thing happen to us children i mean every year we all are made to hear stories of pre independence heroes how they sacrificed their lives for us so on and so forth
7232814 whats wrong with knowing what our freedom fighters did for us isnt that wonderful to hear those marvelous tales of heroism that got us our independence
7232815 yes mam it is truly amazing to hear those tales but you know when it comes to application of what they taught us we fail miserably
7232816 lets be very specific gurpreet what are you hinting at
7232817 sir every year my friend aditi prepares a speech for independence day thinking that she is a free citizen and can express her thoughts fearlessly but her speech is censored because it contains facts and realities about the attitude of politicians administrators and indian citizens the same thing happened this year too sir she was told by the speech editor that she was to talk about only the freedom fighters in her speech and any comment on an existing leader may land the school in trouble my point is lets just cancel all these speeches when we cant practice what is embedded in article 19 a of our constitution and that too on the day when we celebrate our independence
7232818 aditi heres the copy of your original speech go ahead and speak your mind
7232819 happy independence day my children and thanks for teaching us the meaning of true independence
7232820 do you know what it means to miss new orleans
7232821 we needed a platform that was not just feature rich but user centered so people of varying skill levels could take advantage of the platform we needed a platform we trusted to keep getting better delivering features that we could integrate and pass that value on to contributors and more importantly end users
7232822 all of the blogs solve the problem of getting quick hitting content to people that need it the blogs are not a replacement for our corporate portal but an addition to it
7232823 when it comes down to it all that matters is the music
7232824 the question is are there 100 around or 1 000 around we dont really know
7232825 ive left my peasant house and gone to fight in georgia to get some land back for the chekists farewell my family farewell my friends lubyanka lubyanka my lubyanka
7232826 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
7232827 you put yourself out there and people will say very very negative and harsh things and you have to have a very thick skin to do it
7232828 we think its really unique and innovative and i think its going to really garner a lot of attention
7232829 a good game that ultimately falls just short of its promise due to a few questionable design decisions
7232830 unfortunately i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel
7232831 its an awesome result and ive got lots of time to try and do it again
7232832 this was a bicycle race not the end of the world its not the worst test of my life its a disappointment for sure but you cant control everything its one day in a life and it happened to me today
7232833 i think a lot of people decided it wasnt worth facing those crowds
7232834 if you didnt have to wait in line for four hours why would you bother
7232835 its funny taking the bus is suddenly the fastest way to ride
7232836 most people seemed pretty ok with the wait i wouldnt have been in nearly as good a mood if it was me
7232837 i try to find common ground with everyone doing everything i can to save some i do everything to spread the good news and share in its blessings
7232838 its crappy to have your worst day on the biggest day
7232839 time couldnt pass fast enough probably only got 41 2 hours sleep just tossing and turning usually i sleep after lunch for 30 or 40 minutes before i get down here i closed my eyes for five minutes wake up pick up my book read half a page close it open my computer and realize i dont want to read any emails and i dont want to watch videos and close it walk out in the hall back in my room have a shower back into bed
7232840 i hate to say that lts been a hard 24 hours
7232841 i wrote down things i wanted to be i wanted to be strong and confident triumphant and the last was adam i wanted to be myself because i wasnt yesterday
7232842 im used to finishing on top im very very fortunate and lucky to have that distinction its a little bit too much to ask that i do it every single time thats what i wanted its not a failure you shoot for the stars and sometimes you only make it to the moon
7232843 man i thought i dont see my name in third im going to i dont know try and disappear and then second disappeared and my heart raced again i thought i was second when i crossed the line
7232844 i didnt walk in here thinking ive got two gold medals in the bag no problem you really cant think that way not in sport
7232845 no encenderemos un interruptor un d a y de repente el p blico del juego se multiplicar por 100
7232846 by any sensible reckoning this is not a story of russian aggression but of us imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of russia by a potentially hostile power
7232847 positive stabilising role as a guarantor of the security progress and co operation
7232848 have drummed the values of the imperial state into the social mind
7232849 we were not defeated by the west in the cold war because the cold war continues we lost gigantic territories but we held moscow from here we launched our counterattack
7232850 last year he singh flew the mp government chopper with me for 20 hours in search of the chhattisgarh helicopter
7232851 mamata is a champion of the farmers cause i have come here to extend support in her fight against farmland acquisition
7232852 builders are grabbing farmers land under the mayawati regime in up we will launch a pan indian movement against farmland acquisition
7232853 the launch of hmda is a historical day for hyderabad as the city now acquires metropolitan status and it will further help in infrastructural developments
7232854 before arriving at any decision the government must take all sections of the kashmiri society including the newly constituted kashmir coordination committee of separatists into confidence
7232855 as has been decided already the government must be entrusted with the responsibility of making arrangements for the amarnath yatra and the environment and weather concerns as have been pointed out by the nitish sengupta committee must be taken into consideration while arriving at any decision in this regard
7232856 the pdp is eagerly looking forward towards resolving the crisis amicably in the larger interest of peace and tranquillity but at the same time any decision in this regard should not be taken in isolation
7232857 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7232858 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7232859 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7232860 the chinese people have greeted all the guests with great enthusiasm and shared with people from across the world the joy and happiness
7232861 we all look forward to the reunion in london in four years time
7232862 had she been arrested by the british and got a police record she could have got a pension of rs 15 000 per month enough to sustain herself
7232863 our existing hub in brussels is working very well we have to strengthen it further but we dont want to put all the eggs in one basket
7232864 we are keeping a close watch since the incident took place
7232865 be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the nations i will be exalted in the earth
7232866 is curfew a solution to the problem i think no the centre should rather start looking for ways and means to bring the separatist leaders to the discussion table rather than having the ostrich like attitude that everything will be fine once the storm is over
7232867 all i can say is that talks were always a better option rather than having knee jerk reactions from the centre
7232868 if talks can be initiated in jammu region to bring peace then i believe the same yardstick should be applied to in kashmir why was the all party meeting that visited kashmir valley not so keen on meeting the fruit growers of the state
7232869 why were fruit growers kept waiting for hours outside the venue before they decided to boycott it its a matter of prioritising the priorities as otherwise priorities become necessities so here are we when we could have sat and found a solution with kashmir fruit growers we missed the chance
7232870 wonder who is being fooled and by whom are bureaucrats being pushed into finding a solution to a vexed kashmir issue because there is no political will or some ias officer sitting in home ministry wants to call shots in the valley
7232871 this is a wake up call as one has seen a systematic collapse of the state administration from july onwards this year till it crumbled like a pack of cards
7232872 one needs to act fast and initiate talks with the separatist leaders at the earliest
7232873 we in the national conference have always been appealing to political parties to exercise utmost restraint in whipping up regional as well as communal passions
7232874 there will be a judicial probe into yesterdays attack on the vhp ashram and its inmates
7232875 by guiding us to wrestle deeply with a crisis of faith experience and by re introducing us to a giant of faith ian cron paves for us a path of grace humility and ultimate joy even through our ground zero darkness this is a life changing work i now find myself chasing francis in my life as well as in my art
7232876 chasing francis ian crons first book introduces us to a bright new writer with a rare combination of strong writing talent storytellers art and profound yet practical spiritual insight he interweaves a fictional contemporary narrative with the life of st francis and creates a unique and meaningful contribution to the emerging conversation about faith and life in todays world expect good things from this gifted writer
7232877 ian cron weds historical facts with his creative imagination to give us a twentieth century feel for a saint who more than anyone since new testament days lived out radical christianity
7232878 the moribund literary form of didactic fiction comes roaring to life in this novel crons genius lies in linking the timeless charism of francis to issues confronting the contemporary church and he pulls it off in compelling fashion
7232879 i read this book marking something on almost every other page i would say my friend cron has done just about the best job ive seen of explaining the usefulness of a so called postmodern view of christian faith id like to be part of a church that his hero ends up proposing
7232880 it seems the world never gets tired of seeking out writing about discovering and falling in love with francis of assisi ian cron does it again but with real insight imagination and courage join in the chase
7232881 chasing francis is not a history or spirituality book though it contains elements of both it is a novel that touches a little of something in the inner troubles of most of us who try to follow jesus faithfully in a modern western environment delightful
7232882 francis would say that your life should become a poem a living work of art kenny said
7232883 once im through with it all it would be my obligation to spread the game
7232884 if travelling india and interacting with the youngsters helps the cause i would love to do that

7232893 ich habe nach wie vor probleme das auto konstant am maximum zu bewegen und die reifen perfekt auszunutzen und da hat es einmal fast optimal hingehauen
7232894 die letzte kurve war nicht ganz sauber aber insgesamt war es eine bessere runde als sonst die setup nderungen haben sich gelohnt es zeigt nach wie vor dass der speed da ist es muss einfach fters so auf den punkt klappen damit habe ich in diesem jahr etwas gr ere probleme
7232895 ich wei schon warum ich es hingekriegt hab aber ich bin mir nicht sicher ob es beim n chsten mal noch einmal genauso klappen w rde

7232899 at the end of the second world war the united states government sent charles eliot perkins a research worker in chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology to take charge of the vast farben chemical plants in germany
7232900 while there he was told by german chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the german general staff
7232901 this was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water in this scheme sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place
7232902 repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individuals power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him
7232903 both the germans and the russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile
7232904 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7232905 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7232906 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic

7232943 i hope malaca ang will find the moral courage to send a diplomatic note to malaysia saying in no uncertain terms that the philippine government will implement its laws against criminals who attack and murder unarmed civilians
7232944 the internationalization of the mindanao peace process is against our national interests
7232945 while we appreciate the generosity of the british ambassador we regret to inform him that the case of northern ireland is the wrong model for the mindanao peace process
7232946 i went there because i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corps and when youre a member and you get invited if youre available you should go

7233016 he has been working with the port mouton people and government agencies and trying to deal with this application

7233019 i am optimistic that the majority of people within the port mouton bay area will find themselves on common ground when it comes to the goals and objectives

7233059 ik vond er geen reet aan heel de nacht lag zij op mijn harses te slaan en aan mijn oren te trekken
7233060 het lijkt wel of die papegaai begrijpt wat ik zeg en zelfs antwoord geeft
7233061 ik versta en begrijp alles wat je zegt ik ben bovenmatig intelligent en zeer goed opgeleid
7233062 nou als je dan zo slim bent vertel me dan eens hoe je zonder pootjes en voetjes zo recht op je stok kan blijven zitten
7233063 t is een beetje genant maar ok ik wikkel mijn kleine papegaaienpiemel om de stok als een soort haakje zeg maar maar dat verberg ik met mijn dikke veren
7233064 en bovendien spreek ik vloeiend spaans en engels ik kan op niveau meepraten over bijna alles politiek religie sport en filosofie en ik heb me gespecialiseerd in vogelkunde je zou me moeten kopen ik ben ook een hele goede vriend voor je
7233065 niemand wil me omdat ik geen pootjes heb biedt maar f 25 en je mag me zo meenemen
7233066 ik weet niet of ik je dit wel moet vertellen
7233067 nou de postbode kwam aan de deur en je vrouw begroette hem in een niets verhullend nachtgewaad en kuste hem plat op de bek
7233068 nou de postbode kwam binnen greep onder haar nachthemd en begon haar overal te strelen
7233069 toen deed hij haar nachthemd uit ging door zijn knieen en begonhaar overal te likken beginnend bij haar borsten en steeds verder en verder naar beneden
7233070 ben je nou helemaal besodemieterd mijn kont is geen sjoelbak
7233071 dokter ik werk sinds kort in een haring fileerbedrijf en ik heb zon drang om mijn leuter in een uiensnijder te stoppen ik kan er geen weerstand aan bieden

7233090 dokter ik voel me de laatste tijd niet zo goed
7233091 een dubbele wiskey graag ach geef ook maar meteen de hele fles
7233092 wat is er gebeurd beste man dat je een fles whiskey nodig hebt
7233093 nou ik was vanmorgen mijn koe aan het melken ik had net de emmer bijna vol schopt dat stomme beest de emmer om met haar rechter poot
7233094 ach komop zulke dingen gebeuren dat is toch geen reden om je halfdood te zuipen
7233095 wacht maar het ergste moet nog komen ik bind dus die rechterpoot vast met een stuk touw aan de stal en ga verder met melken en net als ik de emmer bijna vol heb schopt dat stomme beest de emmer om met haar linkerpoot
7233096 oke dat is dubbel pech maar nog steeds geen reden om die fles achterover te slaan
7233097 wacht maar het ergste moet nog komen ik bind haar linkerpoot vast aan de stal met een stuk touw en ga maar verder met melken en net als ik de emmer bijna vol heb zwiept die stomme koe de emmer om met haar staart
7233098 dat is inderdaad wel heel veel pech maar een hele fles is dat echt nodig
7233099 wacht maar het ergste moet nog komen ik kon geen touw meer vinden dus deed ik mijn broekriem af en bond haar staart ermee vast aan het hek en net op dat moment zakt me de broek af en komt mijn vrouw binnen lopen
7233100 wat zal ik nu doen zal ik wachten totdat hij de blaadjes heeft gegeten of zal ik nu al aanvallen weet je wat ik wacht wel totdat hij ze op heeft dan smaakt hij lekkerder
7233101 ik zal maar wachten totdat hij de rups heeft gegeten dan is hij lekkerder

7233226 gisteren hoorde ik mn vrouw en mn schoonmoeder met elkaar
7233227 die gooi je toch niet weg die kun je bewaren voor het plafond
7233228 je had gelijk al die keren dat je me waarschuwde en ik wilde maar niet naar je luisteren
7233229 nou jij zei altijd al dat ik op een dag mijn ingewanden eruit zou schijten en vandaag is dat gebeurd maar met een beetje geduld een flinke hoeveelheid vaseline en deze twee vingers heb ik het allemaal weer terug kunnen stoppen
7233230 maar voor 5 euro had ik eigenlijk kilos appels kunnen kopen en had ik de pitten er gratis bij gekregen
7233231 geef die man met dat hoedje op er ook maar eentje
7233232 geef die man met dat hoedje op er ook maar weer eentje
7233233 geef iedereen maar een biertje behalve die man met dat hoedje op want die heeft er al twee gehad
7233234 als jij raad hoeveel koekjes er in deze trommel zitten mag jij ze alle drie hebben
7233235 eentje zegt de manager verbaasd de meeste verkopers zitten aan de 20 tot 30 verkopen per dag
7233236 eerst verkocht ik hem een klein vishaakje daarna een middelgrote vishaak en als laatste een grote vishaak toen heb ik de man een complete visuitrusting verkocht toen vroeg ik de man waar hij wilde gaan vissen de man antwoordde dat ie op zee wilde vissen ik heb voorgesteld of een klein bootje niet handig zou zijn voor op zee dus verkocht ik hem die twin engine power craft plus trailer die op de vierde verdieping staat de man zei dat zijn fiat uno dat waarschijnlijk niet zou kunnen trekken dus toen heb ik de man meegenomen naar de autoafdeling en heb hem er de 4 x 4 landcruiser bij verkocht
7233237 dus je vertelt me nu dat er een man binnenkwam voor een klein vishaakje en die heb je een boot en een auto verkocht
7233238 hij kwam voor een doos tampons toen heb ik gezegd joh je weekend kan toch niks meer worden waarom ga je niet lekker vissen
7233239 eerwaarde ik heb in zwitserland een gloednieuw en hypermodern epileer apparaat gekocht het was niet goedkoop en ik heb dus de wettelijke limiet overschreden ik zou er invoerrechten over moeten betalen kunt u mijn ladyshave niet verbergen in uw gewaad
7233240 van mijn hoofd tot aan de gordel heb ik niets aan te geven
7233241 daar bevindt zich een fantastisch apparaat bestemd voor vrouwen dat nog nooit gebruikt is
7233242 ik wil in het rood printen maar het lukt niet
7233243 een pluche knuffelbeestje dat mijn vriendje voor me gekocht heeft in de supermarkt
7233244 weet u zeker dat het ingeplugd zit in de computer
7233245 pak uw toetsenbord op en loop tien meter naar achteren
7233246 dat toetsenbord is dus niet ingeplugd staat er misschien nog een ander toetsenbord
7233247 ja er staat hier nog eentje ah die doet het wel
7233248 ik heb een groot probleem een vriend van mij heeft een screensaver op mijn computer gezet maar iedere keer dat ik de muis beweeg gaat hij weg
7233249 ik lag dus heerlijk in het zonnetje toen dat wijf weer voor mijn verblijf stond kijk normaal hou ik wel van een teefje dat mijn aandacht wil maar van 57 jarige mensen ben ik dus niet gediend he ik heb wel een reputatie die ik hoog moet houden
7233250 maar ja vrijdag ging ze dus iets te ver plotseling gingen er een paar kleine ventjes stenen naar mijn kop gooien ik had al vaker bij de directie aangekaart dat er eens gesproken moest worden over een dierentuinwet maar ja veel gelul in de politiek maar voorlopig blijft dat stenen gooien maar doorgaan nou zag ik dus ook nog eens dat wijf weer naar me lachen en dat was de spreekwoordelijke druppel
7233251 ja leuk zon greppel maar ik had dus al lang door dat ik daar wel overheen zou komen luister die verzorgers zijn allemaal toffe peren snijden je appeltjes wassen wat bananen dus ik blijf al jaren netjes op dat eiland zitten maar ja feyenoord had ook al een kutseizoen dus ik was net wat geprikkelder dan normaal en als je dan hoort dat ze co adriaanse willen halen zon griet je lastig blijft vallen die dierentuinwet op zich laat wachten en van die koters stenen gooien dan ga je je bent een rotterdamse zilverrug of niet
7233252 ernstig ernstig kijk zij wil aandacht van een gorilla dan geef je die op een gorillawijze is het weer niet goed toen ik door had dat ze niet zo goed reageerde op mijn antwoord ben ik netjes van haar afgestapt en naar de kantine gelopen om een pilsje te drinken toen ik daar aankwam bleek dat ze de tap hadden dichtgegooid ja dan breekt er echt iets
7233253 ook weer zon reactie als ze me nou netjes hadden gevraagd of ik terug naar dat eiland had willen lopen had ik dat ook wel gedaan nee hoor schieten ze gelijk weer zon pijl in je reet
7233254 luister ik ben helemaal niet moeilijk maar je moet goed begrijpen eigenlijk hoor ik in het regenwoud in afrika te wonen daar heerst een hele andere cultuur dat moet je respecteren maar goed ik ben redelijk geintegreerd maar dat vrouwen zo respectloos met je omgaan doet pijn heel veel pijn ik overweeg dan ook een flinke claim in te dienen voor de opgelopen emotionele schade
7233255 ja ook hen neem ik het een en ander kwalijk ik vind dat ze best een limiet mogen stellen op de kwantiteit en kwaliteit van de bezoekers die langs komen het is toch van de zotte dat sommige mensen iedere dag langskomen op den duur word je daar toch knettergek van het is dat mijn schoonmoeder nog ergens in kameroen door de bossen rent maar voor je het weet staat die hier ook voor de deur
7233256 ja zij ook het is al geen lolletje om hier te zitten in dat druilerige rotterdam maar dat wanbeleid in de kuip is ook niet normaal dat maakt de zondag als het al drukker is in de diergaarde niet leuker steeds meer feyenoorders gaan op zondag liever naar blijdorp dan naar de kuip bedankt en dan mag ik wel uit het regenwoud komen van bosz hou ik niet
7233257 oef je maakt me aan het schrikken ik dacht even dat kluivert nietzou spelen
7233258 ik vind het zo mooi dat u uw vrouw na al die jaren dat u getrouwd bent nog steeds koosnaamptjes geeft
7233259 ik kan al tien jaar niet meer op haar naam komen
7233260 heb je boven de toog dat bordje niet gezien misschien onder de 18 wordt hier niet getapt
7233261 zuster mag ik mij even verbergen onder uw rok ik leg het later wel uit
7233262 ik wil niet grof zijn zuster maar jij hebt het mooiste paar benen dat ik ooit gezien heb
7233263 je vader denkt dat hij naar de hemel gaat vliegen en daarom blijf ik bovenop hem zitten zodat hij niet weg kan
7233264 leuk je te ontmoeten maar ik ben een moslim en ik wil mohammed ontmoeten

7233462 i hope the atmosphere on the mall and across the entire uk will be electric
7233463 frankie was the one tipped to win a gold yet james degale ends up winning one i havent heard anything from him so i bet hes feeling jealous
7233464 hes a silly boy because if he had come here he could also have won gold if the olympics cannot motivate you to lose a few pounds then youre in trouble
7233465 i was on a 20 000 bonus from the aba if i won gold out here
7233466 so im going to be on their case when i get home
7233467 until i qualified for the olympics i was on 1 500 a month after the commonwealth games two years back i was only on 750
7233468 im pleased to have done my country proud but theyve got to make it worth my while staying amateur
7233469 it still hasnt sunk in yet and probably wont until i get home everyones so proud and happy and i had my mum crying down the phone last night
7233470 i had 60 messages on facebook and 71 friend requests in the time it took me to get back to the olympic village
7233471 ive told gb head coach terry edwards i wont make any decisions before talking to him first
7233472 we had been on the lookout for this vehicle since yesterday evening based on the report of a drunken driver at the wheel
7233473 we didnt find it until the crash was reported this morning
7233474 this arrest is the result of an extensive investigation by our detectives and dcyf
7233475 it began with a call to the residence several months ago
7233476 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has more international experience
7233477 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7233478 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7233479 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7233480 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7233481 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could ever put together
7233482 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7233483 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7233484 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7233485 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7233486 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7233487 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7233488 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7233489 we spoke with his wife and i know he suffered several compound fractures to a leg and arm
7233490 its the only sport where communication between two partners in this case the horse and the rider is the difference between success and a ride in the ambulance
7233491 theres no play book theres trust and intuition an almost telepathic trust that develops between a horse and rider thats almost impossible to put into words
7233492 you dont have to be an equestrian or know anything about show jumping to really enjoy yourself that sunday
7233493 this has got to be one of the most beautiful sports in the world right in their back yard in new hampshire people are going to see olympic caliber athletes youre going to see some of the premiere athletes not just from new england but literally the world
7233494 at this point in the season most of our horses are quite fit
7233495 you dont want to over jump and over use your horses you want to make sure your horse is fit enough so they can last just like any athlete the horses are athletes themselves
7233496 this saves the horses legs from jumping and the concussion of jumping
7233497 so the horses can just think about eating grass and being a horse thats important to keeping them fresh
7233498 when you go to the gym you use your first couple of minutes for stretching to get loose relaxed and limber
7233499 theyve got to really work hard and put their bodies in more difficult positions which definitely strains the muscles a little bit
7233500 theres no one horse thats the same you dont train one horse exactly the same you may have your own system but within that it goes to another level to how each horse is treated differently within that program
7233501 every horse that youre going to see walk into the ring sunday is worth more than your house some of them are worth as much as a small town
7233502 right off the bat theyre braver theyre probably more stubborn and more enthusiastic about life in general
7233503 theyre born into it most of them are offspring of other grand prix sires or mares they know exactly whats going on
7233504 they know the difference between the first round and the jump off
7233505 when the jump off tone rings theyre wild its a spectacular thing to see
7233506 theyre pretty much the same as far as i can see
7233507 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win
7233508 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while
7233509 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7233510 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7233511 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7233512 she was a nobody and a novice who didnt even have support from her party there was no excuse for him to lose to her
7233513 i wont allow them to distort the truth or my record
7233514 weve worked too hard to bring the country back from the brink
7233515 we got there and realized what a mess it was
7233516 weve worked extremely hard im doing what i said i would do which is to work hard for everyone in my district every single day
7233517 its gonna take time for people to have faith in congress again
7233518 what i love about it is that president bush called on us to come back but then headed to crawford texas on vacation
7233519 its easy to pretty frustrated at times but you know whos blocking change
7233520 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the groundballs that i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day basically everything you dont want to do i did today
7233521 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone
7233522 he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7233523 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7233524 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7233525 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7233526 a lot of the time especially at this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7233527 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7233528 there are probably more hairstylists per capita here than in portsmouth
7233529 im excited to be part of the kittery renaissance with its wonderful mix of shops and restaurants
7233530 every household in india has a pot of tulsi in its doorway
7233531 people kept asking when are you going to open a restaurant
7233532 we combine local food with the indian way of cooking and spices
7233533 they are keeping up with the development thats happening all over town
7233534 this area now is not like the foreside used to be
7233535 the opening of this restaurant makes kittery stand a little taller
7233536 when you see all the good food things happening at tulsi you know this is truly a kittery restaurant
7233537 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7233538 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7233539 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7233540 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7233541 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7233542 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7233543 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7233544 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7233545 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7233546 talkin bout my generation getting new hampshires multi generational work force to work for you
7233547 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7233548 lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7233549 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7233550 were 0 3 in the preseason but were still 0 0
7233551 regardless of whos out there its up to us to execute and do our own job it may come out where we may have to be without tom
7233552 we only have another week before we get started but we take a lot of pride in our special teams unit
7233553 theres just no way we can have returns going back on us putting our defense in a tough situation and putting our team in a tough situation

7233597 i have been targeting dap for 20 years and they have been talking about consistency transparency accountability and the need to establish a non race based party
7233598 i feel much more comfortable with dap and i trust the people around me i joined dap for what it stands for a party that has been very consistent with its beliefs
7233599 i am a malay many would expect me to join umno but no i made up my mind and it is dap that i choose and i see no future in race based political parties
7233600 he is a malaysian par excellence it is a momentous decision and to have him in the political arena would help spread much needed justice i hope with this more malaysians would come forward and help us create a much better malaysia
7233601 with abdul aziz in the party it proves that those who labeled dap a chinese chauvinist party were wrong
7233602 siamo sicuri che le autorit cinesi faranno il possibile per garantire la sicurezza di tutti coloro che parteciperanno ai giochi
7233603 abbiamo accolto con favore la notizia che il sito di amnesty sia accessibile dal centro stampa olimpico e probabilmente da altri computer a pechino tuttavia bloccare e sbloccare arbitrariamente determinati siti non basta a soddisfare lobbligo di rispettare gli standard internazionali in materia di libert despressione e dinformazione
7233604 andare allapertura dei giochi olimpici un errore e sarebbe stato importante dare un segnale politico forte tanto pi che i cinesi non hanno rispettato nessuno degli impegni assunti quando si decise che i giochi olimpici si sarebbero svolti a pechino

7233609 that he was willing to give up the sort of easy road to public notice spoke volumes about how deeply he believed in making the democratic process work for people
7233610 when he came back from harvard he needed to move himself into the electoral world
7233611 the voter registration campaign was a way to establish credibility and move into that world it was exactly the right thing to do
7233612 at that moment i said hed be our first black president there was just something about him
7233613 he was accused of being the tool of jews and catholics
7233614 once we see youre a good person well hold you up and stand with you
7233615 i introduced him to as many folks as i knew
7233616 feet to stand on and a higher voice than what they had
7233617 i had my conflicts with him dont get me wrong but you work past it he was more willing to compromise and find common ground on some of these things than i was or some other members of the black caucus racial profiling videotaping of confessions the death penalty barack had the patience and not being in the early fights gave him a level of i guess youd call acceptability with the other side
7233618 hes black but hes not the angry black man he had a different experience i think thats what makes him perfect for this country at this time he understands both worlds
7233619 in a statewide race he could get support from the african american community and the non african american community whereas another african american might not have the same appeal
7233620 when you see a talented individual people just want to see how far this person can go
7233621 i just think people saw him destined for something bigger
7233622 chicago and the community there have been important in terms of getting him to the national stage
7233623 but im fairly confident he probably would have emerged on the national stage if hed lived in another city as well

7233628 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7233629 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys
7233630 but it is just that today a dream its not the reality of american politics
7233631 the only moment of conciliation at that convention was the tribute to bob
7233632 i dont think many republicans would want their kids to get in the car with senator kennedy
7233633 there is a resonance with the kennedys that motivates people to act on the basis of compassion
7233634 that he was willing to give up the sort of easy road to public notice spoke volumes about how deeply he believed in making the democratic process work for people

7233651 some indian leaders believed that it was mrs loy henderson wife of the united states ambassador and some cia agents who encouraged abdullah to think in these terms
7233652 i have several times stated that we acceded to india because we saw there two bright stars of hope and aspiration namely gandhiji and yourself and despite our having so many affinities with pakistan we did not join it because we thought our programme will not fit with their policy if however we are driven to the conclusion that we cannot build our state on our own lines suited to our genius what answer can i give to my people and how am i to face them

7233685 in terms of the championship we couldnt be happier to win in missouri in such difficult conditions was fantastic and to have the flatirons tuning subaru impreza wrx perform flawlessly and put us on the top step of the podium again at olympus was perfect to finish first in production gt and take solid overall championship points at both events was exactly what we were looking for as we started 2008
7233686 in 2007 i think we were focused on too many different things and not focused enough on the individual rallies for 2008 we are focusing more on one rally at a time and it is paying dividends obviously we would love to win a championship again and be invited to the x games but for 2008 we just want to go rallies and focus on having the best rally we can instead of constantly thinking about other things
7233687 in 2006 we were one of the first teams to be invited to participate in the summer x games and in 2007 we just missed earning an invitation right now we are just focusing on doing the best we can at each rally and know that if we run the rallies we are capable of as a team we should be able to secure an invitation for the 2008 summer x games
7233688 olympus was tough for us things were going to plan we had shown we had the pace to match 2006 champion johnson and even though we had some problems that put us out of contention for the rally win a second place finish would have been good for the championship to have had such a fluke mechanical failure there was really devastating it was a really difficult task to get the car repaired and re prepared for the susquehannock trail performance rally and while a driving error cost us the susquehannock rally early on it was a testament to our technician jon brouillet that we were even able to start the rally
7233689 with patrick moro leading the championship but skipping ojibwe we really wanted to take advantage and win the rally when matthew johnson 2006 champion crashed on the second stage we couldnt have asked for a better position championship wise we moved into the lead and were never really pressured by any of our other competitors on the last stage with the rally won i made a mistake and we left the road almost ending up in a lake so we werent able to finish the rally that was really hard result to accept
7233690 i am both really happy and really sad with how the season went i think we showed we had the speed needed to win the championship but we didnt have the consistency even though all the teams start with the same notes at events experience is really important at the rallies while the team had experience at all but one rally i personally had only done two of the rallies before and just having more experience at the rallies in the championship probably would have saved us two did not finish results our wins at 100 acre wood oregon and new england forest rallies proved we can win and our 48 stage class wins and a total of 72 class top two stage times as well as numerous top five overall stage times showed we can challenge anyone in the production gt field and that is something to be proud of despite our bad luck i am very thankful to flatirons tuning and scott crouch for the opportunity to drive for the team and to flatirons tuning technician jon brouillet whose hard work and dedication helped bring the car up to spec and whom gave us a great car and support at every rally i also want to thank our sponsors at tci cobb tuning prodrive as well as all the other people that helped make this season happen
7233691 a thing long expected takes the form of the unexpected when at last it comes
7233692 we made the decision to go to new england to see if we could get back into the championship hunt after a string of two disappointing finishes we wanted to get back on the right track and collect some valuable points hopefully our bad luck is behind us and maybe we can catch a couple breaks in the rest of the season and get back into the fight for the production gt national championship
7233693 with matthew johnson absent from the rally we really wanted to focus on getting a lead in the first series of stages so we could drive from the front and control the pace without having to drive at 100 we really didnt have any issues or make any mistakes
7233694 i think this bodes well for the championship for the team just about everything about the car is getting better and we are finding better pace
7233695 olympus was going to be an important event for us even though we won production gt at the last two rallies we still werent really sure where we were in terms of pace for the championship since at 100 acre wood we had new car teething problems before matthew johnson 2006 champion crashed and in oregon we only went head to head on a few real stages with matthew
7233696 we also really wanted to work on starting at 100 on the first stage so we wouldnt have to worry about trying to make up time later in events something that we had struggling with at previous rallies
7233697 within the first mile of stage five the intercom just went out scott tried to call the notes loud enough for me to hear so we could complete the stage and try to make repairs but it was hard to listen to the notes and concentrate on driving without the intercom working we missed a turn and stalled losing 20 seconds on stages six and seven we wanted to make up some of the time but it was hard for me to concentrate after the problems on stage five we ended up making a couple of mistakes and lost time on both of those stages
7233698 on the repeat stages we were within a couple of seconds of winning the class on every stage it was good to see that when we were on our game we could be competitive for the championship i think if we hadnt decided to compromise on our tire choice we would have been even faster on those stages
7233699 about half way through stage 11 we started to lose turbo boost and had to switch the car to the low boost setting giving up precious horsepower and losing time on stage 12 it became evident we had damaged our exhaust on some of the rough sections at some point and had an exhaust leak that was robbing us of power also a few miles into the stage we were forced to stop with electrical damage which caused the engine to shut down
7233700 oregon was going to be a very important rally for us from the very beginning after shaking the car down at 100 acre wood and not really getting a good chance to measure ourselves against matt johnson we werent really sure how wed do i know how to drive on these roads from when i ran my own production gt car and we made some key improvements to the car but we still needed to see how we would do against matt since he will probably be the driver we will have to beat for the championship
7233701 the stages at pir are tricky you cant really win the rally here but you can lose it we saw 3 of the high budget open class teams blow motors and drop out of the rally before we ever hit the first real stage of the rally matt johnson came out charging hard and looked to be taking big risks we wanted to play it safe and try to get into rally mode and get adapted to our new suspension we lost more time then we wanted to but it was important to make sure we didnt damage the car when the real stages begin we planned to go out and push on saturday and try to make up time and maybe pressure matt into making a mistake so we could close the gap
7233702 on saturday i was really pushing the car and trying to attack while not taking too many risks we were able to beat matt on the first stage which was important for us
7233703 we had a couple of minor mechanical issues with the differentials sometimes putting us into front wheel drive but i dont think it effected our times very much it was too bad that matt johnson broke his transmission on saturday and wasnt able to battle with us i feel confident that if we can do better on the starts of rallies though that we can compete for the championship with matt even though we have only gone head to head on one stage with both cars running at 100 we will take the car back to the shop and get the differentials worked out and continue to develop the car towards maximum specification and hopefully we can once again battle for a class win next month at the olympus rally
7233704 last year we released revenues of approximately a little bit over 600 000 we were budgeted for last years operation at 497 000

7233880 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7233881 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7233882 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7233883 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7233884 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7233885 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7233886 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7233887 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area

7233892 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7233893 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7233894 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7233895 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7233896 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7233897 our study shows that most elderly people consider sexual activity and associated feelings a natural part of later life
7233898 it is thus important that sexuality is taken into consideration when dealing with elderly people
7233899 it is possible that our results reflect a more open minded attitude in society to sexual matters rather than real changes in sexual behavior
7233900 makes a welcome contribution to the limited literature on sexuality in older people
7233901 given that sex plays an increasingly valuable role in the lives of older men and women

7233929 research shows this is a great idea we just have a marketing challenge
7233930 consumers really arent driving the trend toward networked devices the device makers are
7233931 the companies are pushing this to try to build a new business to offer new services it is really a matter of getting the infrastructure in place

7233935 most consumer advocates recommend that shoppers refuse to discuss monthly payments and instead focus on the sale price put off all questions about your other intentions by saying you dont know what youre going to do with your current car or whether or not you will finance with the dealer or elsewhere or pay cash answering those questions just complicates matters the only thing that matters in your price negotiation is one thing the price

7233945 theyre as good as anyone around you cant get far without an offensive line
7233946 we got 36 players this year most ive had come out
7233947 we have a bunch of really good running backs and were going to be really fast
7233948 they are some game breakers they all have the ability to break it at any time
7233949 a great leader and a good kid who is hard nosed and plays really well
7233950 we dont have a lot of numbers but we have a lot of good kids who will play hard on every down
7233951 this will be the first time in heber springs history that a team has a chance to go to the playoffs three years in a row
7233952 this is a chance for these kids to write their names in the history book
7233953 i try to fit the system around the kids instead of the kids into a system
7233954 hes going to be the guy who pounds it between the tackles
7233955 hes really gotten to a point now where he can read the defense
7233956 from day one to where he is now is just night and day
7233957 hes probably got the best hands on the team the ball can be high or low and he finds a way to position his body to make the catch
7233958 we really put them through the paces theyve picked up what were trying to do really well athletically it might be the best team ive had
7233959 very rarely can a high school team replace a guy like that neither do you want to go into a situation where youre that dependent on one guy
7233960 a phenomenal offseason hes got tremendous hands just not a lot of friday night experience
7233961 i have 18 seniors thats the fewest ive ever had
7233962 youre going to have to play 285 pounders and 265 pounders everywhere you look
7233963 were going to play hard and try hard and just take things as they come
7233964 when youre as young as we are every days a new day
7233965 theres nobody on our schedule that we can circle but these kids will compete ive got no doubt about that
7233966 when you play eight man football and you miss a block or a tackle its not like missing one at this level
7233967 theyll need to be in good shape because theyll be playing both ways
7233968 that can make or break our season an injury to a key person can really hurt us
7233969 he plays catcher on the baseball team so he has an arm
7233970 well learn a lot about our team with that game
7233971 theres a great sense of pride for all the students
7233972 our goal this year is to do the best we possibly can
7233973 are great ambassadors weve always received compliments on how disciplined they are and how hard they work
7233974 pep rallies dont begin until the band shows up theres something about live music that pumps up the crowd
7233975 many people dont realize how physically demanding marching band is
7233976 imagine jogging for eight minutes while continuously pushing air through 6 to 27 feet of tubing but thats only half of what goes into pulling off a marching performance
7233977 since were the lions some signs will read welcome to the jungle
7233978 the cheerleading squad takes the lead role in school spirit
7233979 whether we win or lose we have a tradition of school pride and we want to set the standard
7233980 we were just a few plays away from having an outstanding season
7233981 we showed progress and won a close one toward the end its not something that happens overnight
7233982 there will be times well have them both in the backfield
7233983 itd take a whole lot to keep me off the football field
7233984 one key for me is knowing im better than the guy in front of me
7233985 nothing makes me happier than to make someone miss and have them fall down
7233986 hes very involved in his church first baptist church doesnt get in trouble and makes good grades
7233987 i think well compete a little bit theyre taking five teams out of the conference for the playoffs and im looking at it as why not us
7233988 the backups are going to get a lot of playing time
7233989 were getting everybody ready to give people a break and well be conditioned
7233990 he runs the show from back there and does a heck of a job
7233991 hes committed to being a kicker and hes taking it seriously
7233992 were going to take it one game at a time try to win as many as we can and maybe make a little history

7234011 make sure everyone is doing their job and then get them the ball
7234012 wed like to make a decision by the first home game in september
7234013 two of the better offensive linemen in the state of arkansas next year
7234014 itll be one of those teams that you look at and say whered they come from
7234015 i know therell be a learning curve as a sophomore but were excited about having him two more years
7234016 its been a few years since dovers been to the playoffs
7234017 so we want to get back to being a contender again
7234018 the musics upbeat for the kids and the crowd it gets the crowd on their feet
7234019 we are going to be able to put in a lot more stunts and to be louder on the sideline
7234020 one of the things we really work on is getting the crowd involved in a positive way
7234021 we really want our crowd through our cheerleaders to be the 12th man on the field
7234022 i think as a team going into it these guys are fairly confident
7234023 they made the playoffs last year and i think they liked it
7234024 we dont really line anyone up out there at receiver
7234025 look at the last place team and the first place team last year north little rock defeated bryant toward the end of the season anybody can beat anybody youve got to come ready to play every night there are no off nights
7234026 skill positions players and the secondary are the strengths of the team
7234027 we also had good numbers 63 in the spring we had our best turnout over the summer that weve ever had
7234028 we have experience and we can run pretty well back there
7234029 time will tell how well they adjust theyre not afraid to hit and if they bite as pups theyre going to bite as big dogs and they bite pretty good right now
7234030 our expectations are high just like anyone else this time of year
7234031 the thing weve got to do is prepare during the week so we are ready for friday night hopefully this group of seniors can take the locker room and give it a senior businesslike approach
7234032 is there a self help book on how to parent a newborn and take care of your husband on chemo without getting to as many aa meetings as usual because you are so fucking busy
7234033 we have a few kids coming over from basketball and we hope some of that will rub off on us
7234034 i just saw it as a good opportunity for a first job as head coach
7234035 its a chance to build a program from the ground up we know the town my wifes from there we go to church there and know the people
7234036 they have done a good job of making that transition from a man scheme to zone weve worked a lot on hand and foot work they are doing a great job learning multiple protections they are really buying into it
7234037 well try to play as many as possible to stay fresh
7234038 aaron is mastering his reads a little faster we are really looking forward to the next two seasons with him they both have done well this summer and both may play
7234039 his kickoffs consistently land inside the 5 yard line and he averaged 42 yards on punts last year
7234040 he had a long of 80 yards on field goals he was consistent inside of 40 yards hes just an athlete
7234041 obviously we are looking to get off to a good start our goal right now is to beat quitman in the opener and qualify for the playoffs we feel like we can be competitive in this league
7234042 the expectations around here are greater than at any point theyve ever been
7234043 this will be the first time in heber springs history that a team has a chance to go to the playoffs three years in a row
7234044 this is a chance for these kids to write their names in the history book
7234045 i try to fit the system around the kids instead of the kids into a system
7234046 hes going to be the guy who pounds it between the tackles
7234047 hes really gotten to a point now where he can read the defense
7234048 from day one to where he is now is just night and day
7234049 hes probably got the best hands on the team the ball can be high or low and he finds a way to position his body to make the catch
7234050 we really put them through the paces theyve picked up what were trying to do really well athletically it might be the best team ive had
7234051 right now the players kind of just want to come and go as they want thats one of the things were trying to tell them is that they have to come in every day
7234052 thats something im going to harp on from day one
7234053 ive seen a big difference in the time ive been with them
7234054 i think we can have a balanced offense now because were playing 7 on 7
7234055 thats something i never did at carlisle there we just did weights and weights and weights we just tried to muscle it
7234056 the mustangs have never won a conference championship so thats a goal
7234057 and we ended up playing for the conference championship in week 10 its a different feeling coming into practice this fall without all those expectations and pressure there
7234058 both of them do certain things well were going to get both of them on the field and give defenses things to think about hopefully
7234059 i think cabot and north little rock and catholic are going to be really good its just going to be consistent play that determines where the rest of the of us fall
7234060 i think well compete a little bit theyre taking five teams out of the conference for the playoffs and im looking at it as why not us
7234061 the backups are going to get a lot of playing time
7234062 were getting everybody ready to give people a break and well be conditioned
7234063 he runs the show from back there and does a heck of a job
7234064 no one gives a flip what you did last year
7234065 you have to be bowed up and prepared for this year weve had good practices so far this summer not many of the kids enjoyed winning just four games
7234066 he has unique talents and skills and is able to see the field like no one weve had
7234067 plus hes a lefty and understands timing hes able to get the ball out on time
7234068 hes got to make better decisions which hes started to do this season
7234069 theyre all about 10 to 15 pounds heavier and its all in good muscle form their body fats gone down every one of them
7234070 its going to be hard for defenses to key on one guy
7234071 just because youre in the shotgun with four wide receivers people think you cant run the football
7234072 youve got to be able to do both and do both every game
7234073 the strength of the conference is not even close compared to last year
7234074 year in and year out they are all very strong football teams
7234075 i know he can play football in college but i dont know what position hes probably the best defensive back we have but we just cant afford to play him over there
7234076 he can secure it as quick as anyone ive seen
7234077 we d like to go in and not stop there our kids need to go on the field expecting to win and they do
7234078 one may play receiver when hes not playing running back
7234079 weve got some kids if they would just show up
7234080 i really dont know what demands were placed on them before i think theyre just adjusting to me and what they can and cannot do and that part is a process
7234081 were still looking to which one is going to rise to the top
7234082 having three quarterbacks is a good problem to have and all of them can help at other places
7234083 we are fortunate to have a house full of linebackers
7234084 big heart drives him and can override size and strength
7234085 but the 6a south has always been tough there are multiple state champions here including the reigning state champion texarkana
7234086 mellon does a good job at weak side end pass rush
7234087 the defensive line should be our strong point were a lot bigger and stronger than we were last year
7234088 we have a chance to be a decent football team this year
7234089 the numbers are up and theyre working hard and are excited about the upcoming season
7234090 i kind of had the itch to be a head coach again and i knew the principal at western yell because he was a former player of mine
7234091 im excited to be working with kids at western yell county
7234092 jonny is an excellent player both at tailback and at linebacker
7234093 we got some kids who can catch the ball and run after they catch it
7234094 clark made a lot of progress this spring and summer throwing the ball and learning the system
7234095 we think that in our conference we might be able to surprise some people
7234096 the main thing is to develop a real good attitude about the program a lot of people want to see a real good program in the community
7234097 oh my god oh my god i cant believe it rex you wont believe what just happened
7234098 fucks sake hon i look like a hundred year old chinaman
7234099 well yes it is but im sure it will grow back properly i still love you i still love you through all of this shit even when you look at me like you hate my guts its just the chemo talking even when youre acting like such a fucking angry prick i still love you

7234124 we felt like they could have if wed needed them to were hoping that shows up this year
7234125 hes truly a power running fullback which is ideal for our offense
7234126 weve kind of gotten used to playing for conference championships here
7234127 some years it may not appear like we should but thats where we are
7234128 barrett is a strong physical thrower and blake spreads the ball around well
7234129 they have the opportunity to take it the distance quick sparks is a slasher type a great zone runner
7234130 we have good receivers that catch the ball well and do things with it
7234131 we got a lot of youth but we got a lot of holes to plug
7234132 its no secret it was a tough year for hector football last year
7234133 were going to be young were going to have to build it from the ground up
7234134 when you go through a season like last years when the attitudes go south its easy for players to become me players
7234135 ive tried to preach to these boys since i got here that during times of adversity its important that we draw back together and refocus on whats really important and thats the team
7234136 i believe were slowly getting there as a staff we talk about it and everything we do is going to have to be driven by team
7234137 i think the teams going to have to come out and be leaders together
7234138 the people of hector love their school and their program
7234139 from what i can tell and listening to people in the community it was a tough season not only for the kids it was a tough season for the school and the surrounding community
7234140 i couldnt be more pleased with the reception ive had here everybody has welcomed me back with open arms i couldnt ask for it to be any better
7234141 when those kids bought into it back then hector football took off
7234142 i definitely think dropping down to 2a is going to work to our advantage
7234143 i think it gives us a chance to compete i think it raises our chance for victory
7234144 thats a big difference having a senior out there who can run the offense
7234145 i hope were a year better weve learned from our mistakes and the knocks we took last year i hope well step up and play this year
7234146 hes done what he can do to improve and hes made a lot of strides
7234147 were going to line up in one back stuff most of the time
7234148 wed like to be a run predominant team but we still throw the ball quite a bit
7234149 were going to have the same guys on offense and defense
7234150 were going to run the same offense and pretty much the exact same defense
7234151 hopefully those younger guys understand the difference between junior high and senior high football
7234152 well here it is you wanted a baby and you got one happy now this is what you wanted
7234153 he did nothing all he did was write down my drinking and drugging history

7234167 then when october comes around thats when we go to competitions
7234168 weve got a great group of girls this year its the best group ive seen as far as working together
7234169 we leave it up to the girls on whether or not they want to go to competition we prefer them to think of themselves as cheerleaders first and as a competitive team second
7234170 this group of girls is really excited to be alive and excited about cheerleading
7234171 they want to cheer for a school with a lot of school spirit
7234172 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of united states of america joe biden

7234180 ainda n o temos marcas brasileiras com exce o de havaianas e h stern conhecidas l fora
7234181 o quadro ruim e eu tenho alertado o setor e o governo sobre isso
7234182 hoje isso est invertido a rua que influencia os outros dois todos os grandes nomes as grandes marcas est o indo s ruas observar e o resultado uma moda m ltipla com muitas caras ent o quando me perguntam o que est na moda hoje eu respondo para que tribo
7234183 n o se usa mais uma pe a para expressar que voc pertence a alguma categoria mas sim para expressar a sua individualidade
7234184 consumir moda em determinadas regi es representa a oportunidade daquelas pessoas de n o pertencerem mais a uma categoria e sim terem sua individualidade
7234185 agora uma quest o de civilidade de identidade temos de criar certos c digos para que o nosso dia a dia n o vire uma guerra

7234254 people kept asking when are you going to open a restaurant
7234255 we combine local food with the indian way of cooking and spices
7234256 they are keeping up with the development thats happening all over town
7234257 this area now is not like the foreside used to be
7234258 the opening of this restaurant makes kittery stand a little taller
7234259 when you see all the good food things happening at tulsi you know this is truly a kittery restaurant

7234261 in the beginning we wanted to draw a knockout punch early they just didnt fall
7234262 it became more difficult for us because of it we were kind of rushing things everybody was trying to do it on their own taking shots on their own we settled down in the second half we played as team in the second half
7234263 i was very happy with the second half especially with the second team
7234264 weve been an unselfish team the entire year i told the team lets not start to change now when weve had a little bit of success in the second half we tried to get back more to playing as a team it came down to the defense of the second team that separated us in this game
7234265 periodical exams were postponed on aug 14 15 but students didnt obey our advice to stay home until things return to normal
7234266 i even saw a student with patches of pieces of an intermediate paper on the head and drops of candle wax on the feet after treatment by the faith healer
7234267 were open to whatever will be effective and will heal the students we want our classes to return to normal as soon as possible
7234268 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

7234273 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7234274 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7234275 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7234276 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7234277 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7234278 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7234279 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7234295 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall

7234297 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7234298 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

7234302 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

7234316 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion
7234317 when it went off it was the loudest explosion ive ever heard the force was so great that some of the wagons were forced off the tracks

7234319 we find that 944 names of voters who are eligible to vote have disappeared whereas they had voted in the march election this year

7234326 wir fanden es ungew hnlich dass keiner dieser proteste stattfand
7234327 yes we may expect more passengers in rajdhanis during the coming months as many travellers wont be able to afford air travel
7234328 we are planning to launch a few packages along with airlines where a tourist will travel a distance by train before catching a flight if aviation fuel keeps rising it will have an impact on our packages as well
7234329 major life events may precipitate or co occur with the development of chronic daily headaches
7234330 a change in work status was related to increased risk for chronic daily headache while in contrast those younger than 40 years showed a decreased risk for chronic daily headache after a job change
7234331 our finding that the relationship may be stronger for those older than 40 was an interesting but secondary finding that should be replicated in other samples
7234332 the industry will have to see how oil is priced in rupee terms and also look closely at the effect of indian currency vis vis other international currencies generally i can say that there is discrepancy in the price that oil companies ask for and what they should be asking
7234333 therefore the room to manoeuvre as regards pricing of air tickets is limited if there is a marginal decrease of say up to 5 per cent in prices of aviation turbine fuel the industry is unlikely to be able to pass this on to the customer an increase in fares is possible if fuel does not come down significantly
7234334 this is constrained by airline capacity and right now its only saa flying directly to india we would like indian airlines to fly here and we would like to address that issue as soon as possible
7234335 i can take the rain on the roof of this empty house that dont bother me i can take a few tears now and then and just let them out im not afraid to cry every once in a while even though going on with you gone still upsets me there are days every now and again i pretend im ok but thats not what gets me what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away and never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was trying to do its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere i go but im doin it its hard to force that smile when i see our old friends and im alone still harder getting up getting dressed living with this regret but i know if i could do it over i would trade give away all the words that i saved in my heart that i left unspoken what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away and never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was trying to do im not afraid to cry every once in a while even though going on with you gone still upsets me there are days every now and again i pretend im ok but thats not what gets me what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away and never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was trying to do what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away and never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was trying to do
7234336 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the groundballs that i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day basically everything you dont want to do i did today
7234337 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone
7234338 he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7234339 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7234340 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7234341 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7234342 a lot of the time especially at this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7234343 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7234344 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7234345 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7234346 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7234347 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7234348 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7234349 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7234350 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7234351 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7234352 lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7234353 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7234354 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7234355 we brought david hobday in as the business had grown so big the us was doing very well but sadly six months later uigea happened at that point we did a lot of downsizing waited until that bedded in and then re assessed the situation it is by no means daves fault it is sad for the individuals concerned and it does seem slightly perverse that the company has been performing so well the board thanks hobday for his hard work and dedication
7234356 after losing the amount of business we lost its amazing to still be here
7234357 in terms of forecasts for the end of the year the market is now forecasting that we will do 28 million and we are happy with that
7234358 our whole team comes from people whose lives revolve around bingo and we think well be able to offer an experience that reflects that our aim is to build a bingo community of people who are looking for fun
7234359 we were able to discuss components for possible settlements and while we have not yet reached the point of settlement i feel that we are closer to a settlement than we were when we met first on 18 january

7234477 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7234478 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

7234489 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

7234569 its going to make me be a bit more vigilant
7234570 i dont think these people are worthy of much attention except that you should do what you normally do to lock down your infrastructure
7234571 will implement most of the changes that have been made to the upcoming ps3 version
7234572 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7234573 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate
7234574 broad jurisdiction over the operation of our nations financial institutions housing and mass transit programs
7234575 we have sold every seat and even re sold dozens of seats donated back to the event for those who wish to support the event but cant attend we are at capacity for this mondays event
7234576 we head into this years fundraiser with a sellout crowd of 900 plus guests we couldnt be more thrilled it is a great problem to have
7234577 she was a nobody and a novice who didnt even have support from her party there was no excuse for him to lose to her
7234578 i wont allow them to distort the truth or my record
7234579 weve worked too hard to bring the country back from the brink
7234580 we got there and realized what a mess it was
7234581 weve worked extremely hard im doing what i said i would do which is to work hard for everyone in my district every single day
7234582 its gonna take time for people to have faith in congress again
7234583 what i love about it is that president bush called on us to come back but then headed to crawford texas on vacation
7234584 its easy to pretty frustrated at times but you know whos blocking change
7234585 diane worked with such compassion and integrity thats always been her skill
7234586 we look at disadvantaged residents of the keys towns and bring citizens together to express what they need
7234587 what if you have money but you have a disability the wealthy can be disadvantaged what if you are a wealthy woman but you have post partum depression what if toxins disadvantage you
7234588 we look at any keys resident struggling with a problem that has a community component and needs a community response not a portland answer not a portsmouth answer but an answer for the keys region
7234589 diane told us to not only look at the need but look at what the assets are we in the social services have a history of looking at need but diane said look at the assets because we have a lot of them
7234590 im not only talking about corporate entities who might make donations but people resources who are the people what are the assets of youth or our seniors or other targeted populations that we might not think to ask
7234591 raising children cooking getting everyone where they have to go is hard enough but what if she doesnt have a car what if shes being abused
7234592 we conducted long interviews and i learned how to listen how to see things from different sides and isnt that the basis of peace and not war seeing things from various perspectives
7234593 a lot of students dont want to be part of the drunk frat scene but dont know what else to do at orientation we told them if youre not attracted to the drinking scene we have an option for you
7234594 the feds were happy with it which kind of surprised me
7234595 i told them im not a medical person im not a hospital person
7234596 they said were hiring you to work in the community
7234597 unfortunately the area is seen as not maine and not new hampshire theres always been this split certain things were fully available for southern york county but a lot was not
7234598 in order to do what we were proposing there had to be a lot of facilitating a lot of communication we had to have people buy in and thats where she had strength
7234599 of all the things ive done in my life what we accomplished then was one of the more powerful examples of people who want to make a change creating a safe process to move improvements forward
7234600 and diane was at the center of it she was the glue that kept us all together we lived in fear of her leaving
7234601 the funding environment is less friendly right now for more creative holistic community based generalists like me
7234602 now you have to be specific if youre working organic matter into the garden and it helps everything in the garden thats a generalist if youre dealing with one crop and showing measurable improvements in the one crop you planted thats whats getting funding right now
7234603 ill be 63 in september for the last couple of years i was getting tired theres a physical and mental and emotional level that declines for most of us
7234604 im still intelligent and im still capable but having deadline deadline deadline made me ill its time to slow down
7234605 today people understand the concept of working together in a very real way because of diane
7234606 the fact is were much better off if we find common ground instead of looking for differences and she was very much a champion of common ground
7234607 they havent been open with consumers ultimately this all comes down the the fact that they just want to track you guys
7234608 once money actually starts flowing through once the financial incentive for malware exists then youre going to start seeing more of this type of thing pop up
7234609 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7234610 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters
7234611 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7234612 i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so once so deplored
7234613 you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7234614 we spoke with his wife and i know he suffered several compound fractures to a leg and arm
7234615 because i dont want to sound stupid when i talk about religion
7234616 because this country is so diverse i think that the president shouldnt just put one religion into his speeches he should try to use more
7234617 because the president would sound fake if he used different types of religions in his speeches that he doesnt even believe in
7234618 it is the rise of the rest the rest of the world
7234619 i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
7234620 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7234621 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7234622 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7234623 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7234624 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7234625 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7234626 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region
7234627 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7234628 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto

7234631 ein verpflichtendes gratis kindergartenjahr ist f r alle kinder ein gro er bildungsbeitrag wir sehen das als bildungsjahr und das soll den kindern einen optimalen start ins schulleben erm glichen
7234632 wir hoffen auf eine baldige umsetzung des gratis kindergartenjahres so ein wichtiges projekt darf schlussendlich nicht an der finanzierung scheitern
7234633 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7234634 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7234635 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7234636 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7234637 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7234638 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7234639 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7234640 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7234641 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7234642 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7234643 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7234644 wegen versto es gegen den paragraphen 419 zu insgesamt 376 jahren haft verurteilt hat berf hrt wurde der betr ger nur weil das opfer ein gesch ftsmann aus den usa der insgesamt bereits zwei millionen dollar an den betr ger gezahlt hatte um an die versprochenen 20 millionen zu kommen ihn vor ort identifiziert hat
7234645 i said look i have no money but still he kept on bashing me and checking my jackets and my pants and he bashed me and i fell unconscious and i was on the ground
7234646 the new government will focus on writing the new constitution within two years and lead the peace process to a conclusion
7234647 nepali people have given us a great responsibility we will do a miracle in this country by doing economic revolution
7234648 its an epoch making day that has become possible after a long struggle of the nepali people
7234649 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7234650 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7234651 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7234652 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7234653 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7234654 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7234655 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7234656 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7234657 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7234658 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7234659 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7234660 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7234661 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7234662 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7234663 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7234664 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7234665 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7234666 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7234667 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7234668 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7234669 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7234670 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7234671 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7234672 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7234673 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7234674 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7234675 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7234676 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7234677 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7234678 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7234679 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7234680 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7234681 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7234682 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7234683 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7234684 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7234685 shit as jeg trodde det var en fyr som s helt lik ut som meg men s jeg at camilla satt ved siden av og skj nnte at det var meg
7234686 aber weit gefehlt denn dieses neuerliche nes projekt tr gt nicht ohne grund den beinamen
7234687 ich habe nichts dagegen dass zardari bei der pr sidentschaftswahl antritt wenn er die 17 verfassungs nderung abschafft
7234688 das olympische dorf war gro artig die wettkampfst tten erstklassig die organisation makellos
7234689 aber wir k nnen durch den sport zu positiven ver nderungen beitragen und tun dies auch
7234690 wir fanden es ungew hnlich dass keiner dieser proteste stattfand
7234691 ich glaube das internationale olympische komitee hat sehr viel an glaubw rdigkeit eingeb t und es h tte sehr viel mehr auch konsequent fordernd auftreten k nnen und auftreten m ssen
7234692 es waren gro e sch ne olympische sportspiele aber eine fassade was die verdeckung von unterdr ckung von demokratischen rechten angeht
7234693 wir sind entt uscht dass china das ereignis der olympischen spiele nicht genutzt hat um gr ere toleranz und offenheit zu zeigen
7234694 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7234695 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7234696 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7234697 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7234698 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7234699 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7234700 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7234701 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7234702 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7234703 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7234704 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7234705 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7234706 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7234707 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7234708 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7234709 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7234710 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7234711 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7234712 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7234713 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7234714 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7234715 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7234716 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7234717 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7234718 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7234719 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7234720 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7234721 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7234722 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7234723 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7234724 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7234725 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7234726 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

7234756 qualche utente si lamentato del fatto che il contatore sia inattendibile e non rispetti effettivamente il numero delle visite

7234758 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
7234759 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti

7234761 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
7234762 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
7234763 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
7234764 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
7234765 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
7234766 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
7234767 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
7234768 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
7234769 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

7234771 credo che il tuo blog sia sempre stato uno dei pi interessanti
7234772 leggo spesso il tuo blog sono una tra tante e mi piace un sacco quello che hai da dire
7234773 se il blog fosse un paese tu saresti sicuramente la piazza del duomo
7234774 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
7234775 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
7234776 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice
7234777 quando vedi qualcuno che invidioso di te guardalo negli occhi e digli
7234778 niente che non fosse vero ho solo riscritto il tuo in maniera diversa
7234779 i figli sono strani un giorno sono piccoli triciclisti e un altro giorno jumbo jettano verso luniversit
7234780 sorridi anche se sei triste perch non c nulla di pi triste della tristezza di non poter sorridere
7234781 ho vissuto un film e lui non ha visto la stessa pellicola
7234782 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7234783 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7234784 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7234785 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7234786 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7234787 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7234788 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7234789 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7234790 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7234791 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7234792 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7234793 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7234794 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7234795 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7234796 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7234797 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7234798 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7234799 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7234800 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7234801 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7234802 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7234803 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7234804 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7234805 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7234806 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7234807 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7234808 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7234809 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7234810 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7234811 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7234812 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7234813 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7234814 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7234815 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7234816 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7234817 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7234818 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7234819 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7234820 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7234821 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7234822 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7234823 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7234824 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7234825 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7234826 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7234827 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7234828 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7234829 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7234830 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7234831 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7234832 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7234833 britains amazing athletes have shown us how britain can be one of the best in sport
7234834 this is a very cruel thing to foist upon our wonderful athletes who have so proudly flown the flag here
7234835 at the heart of all this is the simple fact that these people want to create a single country called europe our westminster politicians try to pretend otherwise but ideas like this let the cat out of the bag

7234839 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7234840 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7234841 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7234842 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7234843 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7234844 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7234845 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7234846 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7234847 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7234848 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7234849 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7234850 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7234851 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7234852 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7234853 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7234854 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7234855 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7234856 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7234857 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7234858 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7234859 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7234860 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7234887 he will be praised and beloved and others will desire to emulate him this person has sanctified the almighty
7234888 tell everyone to get on and let those in the back pass up their money or cartisiot
7234889 i set before you a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of god the curse if you do not and you follow other gods
7234890 you will slaughter animals according to the manner i god have prescribed
7234891 you are a nation consecrated to god your lord god has chosen you from all nations on the face of the earth to be his own special nation deut 14 1 2
7234892 see i am placing before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if you will listen to the commandments of the almighty which i am commanding you this day and the curse if you do not listen to the almightys commandments
7234893 he is speaking to everyone else here i dont have to take what he says seriously since he is not really directing his words to me
7234894 and now israel what does god ask from you other than to fear him
7234895 well all that god really wants is that you fear him
7234896 hmm this stuff looks pretty good i think ill have some right now
7234897 im doing a tap dance what do you think im doing im eating what does it look like
7234898 look im hungry and the food is yummy why dont you have some of yours too itll put you in a better mood
7234899 no way im saving all my stuff until i absolutely have to have some thats the way to do things right sandy
7234900 okay guys everyone out time to hit the nature trail
7234901 how can a person be expected to hike a trail on a packed stomach
7234902 who told you to pack your stomach in the first place
7234903 that last growl was loud enough to wake up a hibernating bear
7234904 but im sort of out of stuff anyway my stomachs still really hurting
7234905 im waiting until i really need to eat something i just wish i had some more energy and my stupid headache would go away
7234906 i cant wait to get back to camp and finally eat something again
7234907 here you might as well take some of my stuff
7234908 i guess i waited too long because in the end i didnt touch a thing
7234909 america at the crossroads democracy power and the neoconservative legacy

7234911 aw dont be such a worry wart anyway what could possibly
7234912 were gonna capsize were gonna capsize where are the life jackets
7234913 i guess i kinda um lost my cool out there but you were the man how did you ever pull that off
7234914 you know jeff im not really sure i just wasnt that scared could be cuz when i was younger i had pretty bad asthma and couldnt do a lot of stuff one of the games i used to play to keep myself occupied was called what would you do if i used to make up really scary dangerous situations and id have to figure out how to get out of them this was nothing compared to being charged by a pack of elephants in a rainstorm
7234915 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort
7234916 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada
7234917 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7234918 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see there has been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term
7234919 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7234920 we asked the international gymnastics federation to open up an inquiry themselves
7234921 eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7234922 it seems to be okay however they want to examine this thoroughly they will report to us as soon as possible
7234923 its a pretty simple system so i dont know what else to tell you

7234932 no se puede querer imputar el peso de la situaci n exclusivamente a los salarios
7234933 hay empresas que est n registrando balances con unos beneficios muy potentes por tanto habr que hacer sacrificios en las dos direcciones
7234934 puedo estar de acuerdo con que se congele el sueldo de los ministros y de los altos cargos pero este mensaje no se le puede trasladar a una persona que cobra 1 000 euros al mes porque ya est haciendo un sacrificio cada d a

7234941 in light of the 11 millimetres of rain that fell last night which was considerably more than forecast we thought wed better take a look
7234942 we would not want any significant rainfall but the forecast is for a warm day with sunny spells with just a chance of light rain
7234943 we remain very optimistic but we would not want the forecast to be as wrong as it was last night
7234944 i think this stadium is a lucky charm for me
7234945 of course im absolutely delighted we have a very good team here im glad with sunderland supporters they have been fantastic
7234946 you know i broke my leg twice but i managed to continue my career at the highest level so being able to play premier league football again is huge
7234947 i really aim to give back to sunderland what hey gave me
7234948 they offered me the chance to return to england as a consequence i wish to score goals to thank them
7234949 ive been watching sunderland and can tell they can play football nothings perfect on the pitch but the level is high
7234950 i know a lot of people dont agree with me i have had lots of letters and i have seen all the postbags
7234951 it is for me to make that decision on barton and i have made what i think will turn out to be the right decision
7234952 i would have thought that he has a chance of playing for the first team soon he is back here and hes up for selection

7234960 i know how the world works im glad that they are teaching my kids the facts of life nobody cares its just about the money
7234961 the expected result is a whole new flock of people trained to work manual labor jobs with no hope of college this will keep the cost of labor down as we kick out immigrants wherever possible the others schools can focus on future leaders we will focus on future followers
7234962 look it is a fact of life that not everyone can be successful so we figure lets teach some kids how to be unsuccessful they need skills that they will actually use like counting money and reading want ads why are we filling them up with science and history when all that teaches them is ambition the great thing about our program is that tv can make up for whatever we miss

7234990 nearly every writer on color proposes one theory or another on how to achieve harmonious color some recommend analogous color schemes some suggests complementary colors others triadic color schemes three hues equidistant on the color wheel or tetradic arrangements hues at four points on the color wheel and still others german colorist johannes itten for example recommend all of the above
7234991 if fur farming can be that humane why has it been outlawed in the uk

7235001 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
7235002 leadership vision is an essential means for focusing attention on what matters most what you want to accomplish in your life and what kind of leader you wish to be a useful vision has to be rooted in your past address the future and deal with todays realities it represents who you are and what you stand for it inspires you and the people whose commitment you need to act to make constructive change towards a future you all want to see lets look a bit more closely at the four key components a compelling story of the future is engaging it captures the heart forces you to pay attention those who hear it want to be a part of it somehow and they are moved what does your future look like whats the image if others could travel into the future with you what would they find a well crafted leadership vision is described in concrete terms that are easy to visualize and remember the story of your future should be a stretch but it must be achievable too if it were not achievable you would have little motivation to even bother trying finally future simply means out there some time from this moment forward but not so far away thats its out of reach

7235050 attention were going to make some changes in the paper starting next sunday
7235051 its no secret the daily dispatch is trouncing us in the numbers
7235052 to beat them at their game we have to play their game this is just a cosmetic approach we dont have the resources to adjust our advertising to their size
7235053 i used to write for the dispatch and hated how i had to cut my words down to fit their format
7235054 it gives a list of 20 greatest achievements by engineering in the 20th century
7235055 here is another version in the mindquiz series if you are a regular player of this game you already know about it but still for new comers here is a quick description
7235056 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7235057 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7235058 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7235059 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7235060 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7235061 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7235062 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7235063 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7235064 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7235065 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7235066 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7235067 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7235068 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7235069 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7235070 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7235071 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7235072 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7235073 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7235074 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7235075 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7235076 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7235077 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7235078 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7235079 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7235080 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7235081 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7235082 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7235083 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7235084 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7235085 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7235086 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7235087 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7235088 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7235089 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7235090 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7235091 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7235092 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7235093 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7235094 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7235095 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7235096 if theres something wrong those who have the ability to take action have the responsibility to take action
7235097 the knower of truth should go about the world outwardly stupid like a child a madman or a devil
7235098 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7235099 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7235100 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7235101 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7235102 britains amazing athletes have shown us how britain can be one of the best in sport team gb means great britain on 19 occasions the union flag has been flown at the top of the pole and they have been very proud moments for all the athletes
7235103 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7235104 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7235105 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7235106 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7235107 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7235108 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7235109 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7235110 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7235111 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7235112 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7235113 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7235114 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7235115 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7235116 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7235117 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7235118 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7235119 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7235120 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7235121 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7235122 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7235123 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7235124 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7235125 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7235126 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7235127 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7235128 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7235129 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7235130 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7235131 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7235132 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7235133 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7235134 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7235135 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7235136 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7235137 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7235138 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7235139 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7235140 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7235141 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7235142 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7235143 our board is very interested in the charrette we want to beautify the area and give it an identity we want to create a mediterranean style
7235144 we also need to look at these items a little closer and make sure the public knows more about whats happening with the district
7235145 thats where i got my experience with dealing with developers
7235146 in the past a lot of people havent paid attention to the community council i just feel that this is a good way to be more proactive in my community
7235147 my goal is be the voice of the community and to request a little more when it comes to health education cultural and social issues
7235148 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7235149 this is a planning took where all things are going
7235150 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7235151 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7235152 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7235153 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7235154 dan apabila pada pertemuan audiensi ini tidak ada keputusan dari pihak brr nias untuk melanjutkan program pembangunan jalan ke alasa maka masyarakat dari 4 kecamatan akan melakukan demo besar besaran dan telah mempersiapkan 35 truk untuk mengangkut masyarakat menuju kantor brr perwakilan nias
7235155 isu pembangunan jalan ruas gunungsitoli alasa tumula tidak dibangun adalah tidak benar yang ada hanya kendala teknis sampai hari ini di bank dunia tetap tercatat program pembangunan jalan namun tidak bisa ditenderkan tahun ini
7235156 there is no question that one of the most likely things that will happen in the next 40 years is that machine and human intelligence will come much closer together
7235157 the ability of humans to communicate with machines and for machines to communicate with humans will get so much better
7235158 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7235159 that machines will be more intelligent than humans is not a question of if or when it will happen the real question is what will it take for us to make it happen
7235160 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7235161 progress in the next 100 years wont be like progress in the last 100 years we are literally watching technology move at an ever increasing pace
7235162 our ability to monitor these keys over a long period of time allows us to tell the client for example if a key changed 30 minutes ago and that maybe you should call the sysadmin that something is up

7235174 if you take the whole gamut of threats from state sponsored organisations to industrial espionage private individuals and malcontents youre talking about a remarkable number of attempted attacks on our system id say in the thousands
7235175 were building this house of cards at the moment connecting elements of our financial systems as well as the systems which control nuclear power or water distribution to the internet and its a very open environment
7235176 most companies are not aware of the threat and have an unreasonable faith in their own security systems
7235177 es kann nicht sein das timo mich nicht gesehen hat er geh rt bestraft
7235178 ich wei gar nicht obs ein stinkefinger war weil ich mich so aufgeregt habe am liebsten w re ich sogar aus dem auto gesprungen
7235179 mein kommandostand hat mir leider nicht gesagt dass nick auf einer schnellen runde hinter mir ist es tut mir leid f r nick
7235180 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7235181 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7235182 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7235183 i doubt his indiscretion ever affected any part of his official duties
7235184 i want to put my fingers in my ears and start going la la la la la because im so superstitious
7235185 but thats such a compliment from a really jaded community
7235186 it was made by a bunch of people who love movies and wanted to go back to what it felt like to see these kind of movies that i saw in the 70s as a kid
7235187 its as if somebody made a robot of my child
7235188 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in and low and behold nobody from pa consulting was available for comment
7235189 weve seen no end to this governments shambolic approach to data security
7235190 the government is collecting more and more information about us but seems utterly incapable of keeping it safe
7235191 only the liberal democrats have comprehensive proposals to keep private information safe we will ensure only essential data is stored and that proper systems are in place to prevent its loss or misuse
7235192 but i always thought more athletes would start coming back and they did
7235193 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can
7235194 maybe i didnt get my pacing quite right but im satisfied with the run
7235195 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7235196 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that
7235197 politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
7235198 cameron has fashioned a new conservative language but his attachment to the market means he cant actually make britain a fairer society he can only talk about it
7235199 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7235200 i am determined to work with the football associations and the international olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7235201 he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7235202 eight members of the 2nd royal regiment of fusiliers have provided positive samples as part of the armys compulsory drug testing programme
7235203 the army treats drug taking very seriously and appropriate action is being taken against all eight soldiers
7235204 most are experience men who should know better its taken the shine off what should be proud days for the battalion
7235205 it was bad enough missing four months earlier in the season following major surgery on my shoulder and knee but suffering another knee injury has been a massive disappointment
7235206 i have really enjoyed my time here and i will miss the rhinos very much
7235207 we came fifth and a lot of clubs look at everton as the right way to do things weve not spent massively to finish fifth we have progressed every year
7235208 why is there a problem getting people in it is a bit of everything weve got all these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week
7235209 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure that it is going to happen all you can see is that it is not helping things through not having brought in new blood
7235210 there was plenty of good play from us we controlled things for the vast amount of time
7235211 i want these people arrested i want to find magdalenas body and i want witnesses
7235212 small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on peoples behavior
7235213 free markets and open competition will tend to exacerbate rather than mitigate the effects of human frailty
7235214 it is pointless to ask government simply to stand aside
7235215 nos demuestra que con un poco de ma a se pueden hacer unas cosicas muy cucas nos quedamos el que mas nos gusta y la semana que viene ya veremos gracias mil
7235216 its a surprise her daughter is turning 18 youd think she could have planned ahead
7235217 it wont be good for me or my neighbors or the bank or merced if i lose it yet thats where im headed its very frustrating
7235218 could have figured out that too much inventory and not enough bodies was a recipe for disaster
7235219 in four or five years when their credit is better and the market has recovered ill sell the house back to them
7235220 ill try my best to pay my mortgage but if not ill have no choice to leave like the other people
7235221 its her luck why would i be mad at her
7235222 there were supposed to be stores and a fire station over there
7235223 we could all march down to city hall and picket but whats really going to happen with that
7235224 i would never deny we all got greedy everyone was setting records nobody was there to take away the punch bowl
7235225 they swore they were going to live in the houses
7235226 property is unacceptable due to high foreclosure rate and volatility of subject market
7235227 if a few institutions take the position that prices in the central valley are still excessive and they need to wait to finance houses there youll have the total collapse of the market
7235228 we have to stop thinking that more growth is always the answer
7235229 we have more housing than we need we need jobs
7235230 ill even do a foot massage later on if people want
7235231 we host a senior citizens dance and visit holden nursing home
7235232 no matter how you heat your home you will pay more this year the outlook is grim
7235233 every dollar spent on fuel is one less spent on the local economy
7235234 this strain on spending at local restaurants grocery stores movie theaters and so on will slow the states economy while sending our money overseas to those who sell us the fuel
7235235 this is the busiest summer weve had in 32 years
7235236 pellet stoves and pellet inserts are popular because of ease of operation but wood stoves are also selling
7235237 the price of pellets has fluctuated and is up from 295 per ton last year to between 310 to 375 this year so far
7235238 we will all pay more for heat this winter but a disproportionate burden falls on the elderly
7235239 state law prevents gas and electric utilities from shutting off gas or electric heat during the winter months there is no such protection for oil customers if they dont pay they dont get deliveries
7235240 someones got to buy the oil there are no easy answers
7235241 we realize this isnt much with costs where they are the amount may go up this year we want to help anyone in need to pay heating fuel costs whether it is for gas electric oil propane wood or pellets
7235242 we have 4 000 in the fund right now last year we were able to help 36 families the year before that we helped 58 families
7235243 people are in a panic over the price of oil
7235244 id love to be able to help everybody but i simply dont have the money with the cost of fuel so high
7235245 were supposed to take care of our people we need to find resources to keep our people warm this winter we have to think outside the box and consider making loans available or seeking donations when your familys freezing you dont want bureaucratic red tape
7235246 the average homeowner used to pay 2 500 a year on oil double that and where can they go what will the elderly on a fixed income or the working poor do
7235247 we started doing recertification on july 14 last year we had over 11 000 applications just over 10 000 qualified for assistance we expect more applications this year
7235248 i f barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
7235249 a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received an official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from sic on a regular basis
7235250 now mr ayres is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something i deplore 40 years ago when i was six or seven years old by the time i met him he was a professor of education at the university of illinois

7235259 at the conceptual level environmental sustainability means society should consume only renewable resources and only at a rate less than their regeneration capacities and society should discharge waste at rates less than the capacity of the environment to assimilate them and continuously recycle nonrenewable resources such as metal sustainability also involves not depriving future generations of resources or the environmental quality we enjoy today thus consuming fossil fuel based energy is in no way sustainable not using fossil energy is impractical right now but conserving it and thinking about ways to switch to renewable energy is a good start
7235260 cell phones have revolutionized communication especially in the developing world
7235261 no longer are land lines required to bring telephone and data services to remote locations all that is necessary are transmission towers cell phones however raise sustainability issues specific to their product life cycle but overall they have made communication technology more accessible and sustainable
7235262 the internet lets people do many things such as reading newspapers online and downloading music and movies think of all the paper material energy and packaging this saves the evolution of the internet has not been without hitches but overall the sustainability of information delivery is dramatically improved
7235263 this sometimes leads to communication problems when discussing the term our organization frequently refers to a well known definition from the world commission on environment and development a u n organization also knows as the brundtland commission its 1987 report
7235264 development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
7235265 conserving energy or water saves money it is really that simple
7235266 however there are capital improvements that can be made in the name of sustainability which might not pay back profitably by conventional economic analysis true sustainability involves triple bottomline accounting which includes finances environment and social capital environmental externalities are easy to quantify but difficult to value likewise social capital such as public reputation and standing as a community citizen is difficult to value but many companies still want to market their green image its part of social capital
7235267 profit is often maximized by selling as many products as possible which favors designing products that have to be replaced frequently
7235268 this is usually incompatible with minimizing environmental impact one idea for getting around this problem is to encourage companies or regulate them to change their mode of operation so that their products are leased rather than sold a company thus benefits if it designs products with long life spans the company is thus selling a service rather than a product
7235269 many companies use methods that are inherently inefficient and environmentally damaging simply because those methods were the only ones available years ago
7235270 typically they focus on energy or water conservation they conduct an audit to form a baseline and discuss goals the company would like to achieve and why it then develops a plan companies can also focus on small issues such as how to apply vacuum to a specific operation or should there be plastic disposable cutlery or reusable metal cutlery and a dishwasher in the employee cafeteria
7235271 when it comes to products that companies sell one important principle of sustainable engineering is that environmental effects of a product should be minimized in all phases of its life cycle from extracting raw materials manufacturing using the product to ultimately recycling it or properly disposing of it at the end of its useful life
7235272 by environmental effects i mean the use of raw materials and energy as well as the discharge of wastes thus environmental effects in addition to traditional constraints like cost and safety need to be incorporated into the decision making process
7235273 if a company considers the entire product life cycle an ambitious undertaking but many companies do it designers must consider the environmental effects of acquiring raw material and transportation waste generation and water and energy consumption packaging product performance and the fate of the product at end of life
7235274 still companies must make choices to develop products that are more sustainable than past ones
7235275 this will take a great deal of research into the environmental effects of alternative materials designs and production methods and after collecting this information decisions will still involve value judgments and assessing uncertainties
7235276 one tool companies could use to design for the environment is life cycle assessment
7235277 and although many companies are mystified by the assessment phase in an lca they might understand and accept it more readily if they knew they could define the goals rather than using one of the already existing assessment frameworks for example rather than using a full spectrum assessment framework such as eco 99 perhaps they only want to focus on their carbon footprint
7235278 sustainability should be incorporated into essentially all engineering courses because all engineering decisions have associated environmental impacts
7235279 this is a major challenge as most engineering courses have been taught the same way for a long time and do not include sustainability issues furthermore engineering textbooks generally do not include material on sustainability and thus instructors must make an extra effort to track down information relevant to their particular course some universities offer separate courses that deal with sustainability and this is certainly a start but it would be far better for these concepts to be built into all engineering courses so students learn to consider sustainability in solving any real world engineering problem

7235288 things are working at the moment and it is down to the way the guys have reacted over the last two weeks it was a real turn up for the books that michael did what he did but that was right for michael
7235289 but it is hats off to the lads they have shown such energy and passion the dressing room is such a happy place and that is because we are winning
7235290 there are areas we need to work on and there are some real positives happening in english cricket at the moment

7235308 in light of the 11 millimetres of rain that fell last night which was considerably more than forecast we thought wed better take a look
7235309 we would not want any significant rainfall but the forecast is for a warm day with sunny spells with just a chance of light rain

7235313 i would have thought that he has a chance of playing for the first team soon he is back here and hes up for selection
7235314 but he is a little bit behind the others because he has missed all of pre season
7235315 i think this stadium is a lucky charm for me
7235316 of course im absolutely delighted we have a very good team here im glad with sunderland supporters they have been fantastic
7235317 you know i broke my leg twice but i managed to continue my career at the highest level so being able to play premier league football again is huge
7235318 i really aim to give back to sunderland what hey gave me
7235319 they offered me the chance to return to england as a consequence i wish to score goals to thank them
7235320 ive been watching sunderland and can tell they can play football nothings perfect on the pitch but the level is high
7235321 this was a particularly horrifying ordeal for a teenage girl and its vital we trace the individuals involved
7235322 the bus station is likely to have been busy at this time of night and i would appeal to anyone who might have seen the two suspects before or after the incident to come forward as they may have important information to give this inquiry
7235323 i like wallace and gromit and stuff like that so when this came up i was very into it
7235324 i helped with the storyline and the model making and the actual animation
7235325 it took a long time with the model making and a few movements every day for the animation
7235326 its been amazing the response everyone has really loved it
7235327 the project came out of a combination of the kids ideas and our ideas
7235328 we wanted something related to the island we live on so i thought of the natural world and the seals came out of that also it happened to be the centenary of the lighthouse

7235330 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7235331 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7235332 he knew he was six points down and bit me he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout
7235333 i looked at the board and it said i was silver then it dropped me down to bronze
7235334 but i have to be happy i came out to these olympics with the hope of getting two medals one of them gold and that is what i have done it has been fantastic i feel very lucky to be here
7235335 i wasnt aware the prime minster was here although i got a good luck note from him just before i competed

7235368 in a self regulatory measure private television broadcasters have announced the setting up of a news broadcasting standards disputes redressal authority nba to enforce its code of ethics and broadcasting standards
7235369 a nine member authority will be chaired by justice j s verma former chief justice of indias supreme court and former national human rights commission nhrc chairperson
7235370 this is the first ever initiative through which the public can put forth their grievances over television content the authority will become operational on october 2 mahatma gandhis birthday
7235371 a press release from nba states a channel acting in breach of established guidelines could hardly defend its motives or suggest that it was acting fairly if it is censured by a jury comprising its peers
7235372 the news broadcasters association nba have established commonly accepted content guidelines as a way of practicing self regulation
7235373 the purpose of these principles of self regulation is to serve as an affirmative declaration of understanding of and compliance with the basic values and objectives that news channels enshrine it is to ensure that these principles are observed in spirit and not just in the letter
7235374 the purpose of putting together the principles of self regulation is to avoid compromising the genre of television news by broadcasting content that is malicious biased regressive knowingly inaccurate hurtful misleading or aimed at willfully concealing a conflict of interest
7235375 the purpose of these principles of self regulation is to empower the profession of television journalism by an abiding set of values which will stand the test of time and ensure that balanced and comprehensive journalism flourishes to strengthen indias democracy

7235381 er worden veel gehackte bedrijfsdatabases aangeboden maar de enorme omvang en kwaliteit van de informatie die bij best western is gestolen maakt dit wel erg bijzonder de russische bendes die in dit soort activiteiten gespecialiseerd zijn zullen de informatie zodra het beschikbaar werd misbruikt hebben in de verkeerde handen is er voldoende data om een enorme europese misdaadgolf te veroorzaken
7235382 these are very subtle shifts a fraction of an inch fraction of a degree fahrenheit
7235383 however losing storms at the end of the winter and beginning of spring lengthens the hot dry season it makes that fraction of an inch maybe more important than it would be otherwise

7235424 there is no such thing as swimming in a straight line the competitors have to swim with the tide so they will be zig zagging their way across
7235425 it was a completely different swim today i swam for 1 hour and 45 minutes and i only got as far as rue point it would take me 40 minutes to do that on a good calm day
7235426 the conditions are just about manageable for the guys that finish it

7235430 esta medalla es el mejor modo de decir adi s
7235431 no voy a replantearme si me voy o no me voy ya es una decisi n tomada esta medalla es el mejor modo de decir adi s
7235432 david ha completado un gran ciclo el list n est muy alto y lo nico que importa es que el est satisfecho y que se pueda retirar estando en lo alto en el podio
7235433 es un jugador que lo ha dado todo por su club y la selecci n es un mito del balonmano viviente y creo que tenemos que darle un aplauso por todo lo que ha hecho
7235434 es un grande dentro y fuera del campo porque al final a los jugadores se les observa no s lo por lo que hacen dentro del campo cuando hemos estado mal l ha reaccionado con el equipo y ha ido para adelante
7235435 se lo merec a ha sido un placer estar con l en los ocho a os que llevo en la selecci n absoluta
7235436 l ha confiado en m nunca me ha desconvocado tenemos diferencia de caracteres y much simas veces hemos chocado pero le deseo lo mejor y ha sido un orgullo estar con l
7235437 la porter a espa ola est muy bien cubierta y va a estar al nivel que siempre ha estado
7235438 el balonmano ahora es f sicamente mucho m s fuerte que antes y los partidos tambi n se preparan m s que antes el equipo espa ol ha demostrado que es tan bueno como los dem s hemos demostrado que siempre estamos en la lucha y ahora hay que continuar con el camino que se ha seguido en los ltimos a os
7235439 hoy es el d a en el que se va david barrufet yo solamente digo que necesito m s tiempo para los m os pero hoy la despedida es la suya es un jugador que tiene una trayectoria impecable tanto como guardameta como compa ero es un gran capit n
7235440 en el vestuario hay ahora mismo much sima alegr a yo estoy muy contento pero estas situaciones cuando se valoran m s es cuando pasa el tiempo
7235441 para los oficiales no hay medalla as que tendremos que hacer una r plica para tener algo de esto pero insisto cuando lo disfrutas es con tu gente y dentro de unos d as
7235442 hicimos un gran torneo en estrasburgo y hoy hemos sido sobre todo un equipo en los cruces depend amos del otro grupo tuvimos malos momentos y alg n jugador tocado que eso tambi n ha influido pero hoy hemos hecho un partido muy completo han aportado todos
7235443 es muy importante que toda la fuerza saliera d a m s importante
7235444 toda la fuerza saliera el d a m s importante
7235445 hemos demostrado que cuando las cosas van mal el equipo se levanta
7235446 barrufet se retira de la selecci n y era una forma bonita de acabar
7235447 david ha completado un gran ciclo ojal que pudi ramos completarlo como l ha estado en cuatro juegos el list n est muy alto lo m s importante es que l est satisfecho y que pueda retirarse en la cima
7235448 ya lo ha conseguido todo ha aportado much simo en esta olimpiada sin l no habr amos llegado a donde estamos
7235449 a nivel de club hemos conseguido todo y como selecci n una medalla
7235450 pero despu s de lo del otro d a hay que reconocer que el equipo se ha levantado despu s de todo lo que han podido criticarnos con raz n o sin ella
7235451 es muy importante que toda esa fuerza saliera el d a m s importante cuando s lo hay una medalla en juego es muy dif cil jugar
7235452 une r cession technique de l conomie fran aise soit deux trimestres cons cutifs de croissance n gatifs est possible
7235453 la france est elle au bord de la r cession
7235454 les deux moteurs de la croissance fran aise la consommation et linvestissement sont en panne du fait de la hausse de linflation et de l rosion de la croissance des revenus
7235455 il y a des raisons de penser que la fin 2008 sera meilleure
7235456 un l ger mieux est attendu partir de la mi 2009 la faveur de la dissipation de la plupart des facteurs n gatifs qui ont pes sur la croissance fran aise
7235457 un euro plus faible et une stabilisation des prix des mati res premi res ne seront sans doute pas suffisants pour compenser le recul attendu de la demande interne et nous pensons donc que la france est entr e dans une p riode de tr s faible croissance qui pourrait entra ner une remont e du ch mage
7235458 la plupart des facteurs qui avaient permis un redressement de lactivit partir de la fin 2005 apr s le ralentissement de 2001 2002 connaissent des volutions d favorables

7235461 por qu s lo blanco es la pregunta que se han hecho por qu algo debe ser blanco cuando se puede mejorar la l nea se llama
7235462 there are people sitting out there suffering and feeling that god doesnt love them and wont forgive them
7235463 they may think theyre the only ones feeling that way but then they come to the retreat and see that there are other people in the same boat theyre able to get healed and get on with their life
7235464 when they come to me they often present with another pressing problem such as depression or drug or alcohol abuse or maybe a suicide attempt
7235465 but when you peel off the layers oftentimes the real cause is the abortion that happened in the past
7235466 our society and culture tells us that abortion is now legal and acceptable so why should it cause pain
7235467 and yet those who are involved and a lot of men are also affected feel that their reactions are not normal so they dont seek help their loss is real but they havent been allowed to grieve
7235468 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
7235469 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
7235470 give us a little rain in lyman county and we will grow crops with the best of them
7235471 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7235472 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7235473 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7235474 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7235475 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7235476 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
7235477 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7235478 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
7235479 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
7235480 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7235481 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7235482 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
7235483 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7235484 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
7235485 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
7235486 our mother worked hard to keep our home and her family happy
7235487 she was always smiling and loved to see her grandchildren
7235488 they liked to sing and dance and they played the guitar and sang all the old songs
7235489 she loved to tell us about it and would laugh all the kids would sit on it at the top and ride it all the way down
7235490 she was very excited about that and saved all of the newspaper clippings
7235491 our father worked as a foreman and machinist at the torrington company and our mother stayed home and took care of us
7235492 i remember walking home from forbes school and she would have lunch for us she was always there for us with a hot meal and we always had our friends come over
7235493 she had a feisty personality and loved to laugh she was a lot of fun to be with and was very outgoing and sociable
7235494 but most of all she loved her family and enjoyed being near her grandchildren her grandchildren meant the world to her
7235495 millions are watching on television in britain and the enthusiasm and joy of the olympic events is rising every day so that when the team returns on monday they will have a tremendous reception and ovation from the whole of the british people

7235497 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion
7235498 during the telephone conversation between the russian and french presidents there was no discussion about replacing russian peacekeeping troops by an osce mission in the buffer zone
7235499 there were no changes in the position of russian peacekeepers overnight but we are expecting that they will withdraw from poti today

7235501 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games and i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit

7235527 many people thought these boats will make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of brining in goods equipment food and medicine

7235555 it is difficult to comment on the value of any potential claim against transnet should it not be able to honour its contractual obligations

7235557 we have negotiated agreements in africa and it is good to have it endorsed by the international community ideally by the security council

7235560 spain were incredible it will go down as one of the greatest olympic games ever every possession mattered you guys felt the intensity so you know how crazy it was for us
7235561 all these guys committed to jerry colangelo three year ago and said they wanted to be part of a team
7235562 we wanted one collective ego weve not had one problem for the coaching team its been the great experience of my life
7235563 we knew spain were going to be a big problem
7235564 they played an incredible game and showed why theyre the world champions but this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place everyone wants to talk about the us players being individuals and arrogant but this was a team and we came out with a big win

7235577 we have gathered today to get back our land money cannot compensate our loss

7235580 a man finds out what is meant by a spitting image when he tries to feed cereal to his infant
7235581 having children makes you no more a parent than having a piano makes you a pianist
7235582 the value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults
7235583 childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights before the dark hour of reason grows
7235584 children at play are not playing about their games should be seen at their most serious minded activity
7235585 children dont need toys to play my one year old is never happier than when he is unraveling an audio tape wearing underwear on his head or making music by clinking a crystal ornament against the glass coffee table and his favorite part of birthdays and christmas is the chance to taste so many kinds of colored wrapping paper while everyone else is distracted with whatever is inside even my older children dont need toys they are quite content reprogramming my computer taking apart the lens of my camera or face painting with the makeup in my bathroom it is parents who need toys we need toys to keep our children away from our things
7235586 when you teach your son you teach your sons son
7235587 to show a child what once delighted you to find the childs delight added to your own this is happiness
7235588 across the fields of yesterday he sometimes comes to me a little lad just back from play the lad i used to be
7235589 it is not for the young to understand us it is for us to understand them after all they cannot put themselves in our places while we have already been in theirs
7235590 a child is an active participating and contributing member of society from birth childhood isnt a time when he is molded into a human who will then live life he is a human who is living life no child will miss the zest and joy of living unless these are denied him by adults who have convinced themselves that childhood is a period of preparation

7235788 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7235789 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7235790 he knew he was six points down and bit me he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout
7235791 i looked at the board and it said i was silver then it dropped me down to bronze

7235808 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world

7235850 wir sind gut im rennen ferrari wird stark sein aber wir reden ein w rtchen mit keine angst
7235851 heikki hat als f nfter eine gute ausgangsposition denn das ist eine ungerade zahl und die seite hat viel grip am start
7235852 massa ist schon ein paar punkte hinten wenn es hier nicht klappt dann muss man eben mit dem zweiten oder dritten platz zufrieden sein und so viele punkte wie m glich machen

7235867 the serious problems in life however are never fully solved the meaning and purpose of a problem seem to lie not in its solution but in our working at it incessantly

7235881 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to grant the english people a referendum on independence for england
7235882 68 of english people want an english parliament 59 of english people want scotland to leave the uk the will of the english people for self rule within the united kingdom is flagrantly ignored because we are told an english parliament within a federal uk would break up the union well maybe english people would prefer independence to being 3rd class citizens within a united kingdom lets ask them
7235883 the government supports the union of the united kingdom we recognise that the devolution settlement is an issue of continued public interest but we do not believe that there is a groundswell of support for an english parliament
7235884 the government believes that it is not necessary to establish a separate english parliament to balance the current devolution settlements in the united kingdom as england is already the dominant partner and english interests are fully represented
7235885 the union is bound together not just by common identity and citizenship but by the enduring interests of the nations that form the union inside the union all of its parts share resources and pool risks to the benefit of each the uk shares access to its natural resources but more important the human resources that are the diverse people living here the risks that are pooled and carried together are inherently uncertain and increasingly volatile they include the challenges of thriving in an increasingly competitive globalised economy whose demands vary ever more swiftly the constantly evolving threat of international terrorism and major challenges like climate change in meeting all of these the united kingdom is stronger together
7235886 we do not believe that there is a groundswell of support for an english parliament
7235887 the government believes that it is not necessary to establish a separate english parliament to balance the current devolution settlements in the united kingdom as england is already the dominant partner and english interests are fully represented
7235888 an english parliament would only be a fraction smaller than the existing uk parliament furthermore such a parliament would dominate policy decisions and it would be likely to become bureaucratic and difficult to pass legislation particularly if there were a different party in government at westminster than that of the suggested english parliament
7235889 the government is taking steps to increase regional accountability including through the introduction of regional ministers
7235890 you are the very man they are in search of
7235891 we are preparing folks for challenges we dont even know exist right now
7235892 at this time no links have been found clearly if any further information comes to light and it is appropriate we will re examine our files
7235893 our investigations remain live inquiries and we always welcome any new information from members of the public in relation to any of these matters
7235894 look at sydney in 2000 where the australians did well but four years later in athens they won even more golds
7235895 the structures will be in place which will hopefully deliver more success over the next 20 years
7235896 youre awarded the games seven years out then as a country you devote more resources toward being successful as the host
7235897 they are doing it across the sports its not just coming from one sport
7235898 in eight years we have become a dominant force right across the board
7235899 the team have been great no one expected them to do this here they have so much to be proud of
7235900 nobody wants to be second place nobody likes losing their last game
7235901 we had a great run in this tournament and we just didnt finish the deal
7235902 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7235903 i havent sacrificed all the things that i have emotionally physically mentally and financially for 60th place at the olympic games
7235904 that just really hurts me just to think that everything that ive done to get me to this point to be able to race
7235905 i can be thankful that maybe i can retire on my own terms and i should value that and maybe walk away
7235906 i cant believe in the shape that im in i finished 60th it just doesnt add up

7235908 theres a dynamic thing happening with class a amps that is completely different from modern style amplifiers
7235909 a modern amp like the jsx head allows you tons of gain regardless of the amount of pressure you play with but when you play through a class a amp and hit a note very lightly it doesnt sound like it has any gain behind it
7235910 i found that when i write i get myself into situations where a class a amp is what i need to make the track work that led us to create the mini colossal it provides an entirely different guitar dynamic from the three channel jsx yet its very complementary on recordings where i used the amps together artistically it fit what i was trying to convey

7235912 the fundamental sonic characteristic of this alloy is responsible for a modern and sophisticated sound with warm sound characteristics and balanced frequencies
7235913 the monitor application has grown dramatically in recent times with the evolution of multiple wedge and stereo in ear systems which can quickly exceed the mix capability of all but the most expensive consoles
7235914 the gl2800m adds a fully featured dedicated monitor console to the popular gl series live sound range it is compact and has a capability that rivals that of much bigger and more expensive consoles
7235915 we have looked at the many issues unique to the monitor engineer and have crafted the gl2800ms feature set to make the job a lot easier from setting up the system using the built in oscillator pink noise generator to running the sound check with independent talkback to each performer and to the foh console
7235916 there are many other benefits including using external inputs for the house engineer to talk directly to the monitor listen wedge or in ears dialling in the swept hpf on each mix to cut unwanted low end and improve amplifier efficiency using the master polarity switching and eq to clean up the overall stage sound hitting the dim buttons to quickly catch problem feedback and plugging the ear piece directly into the consoles headphones socket

7235930 we are helping increase the quality of life for many of the people who could otherwise not afford prescription glasses
7235931 there have been instances where iraqis have gotten themselves in a life threatening situation because they could not read the warning signs so we are potentially saving lives
7235932 they dont have a proper hospital where they can go to be treated
7235933 the clinic they do have is lacking medical supplies such as glasses and the facilities to treat some of the more severe eyesight problems
7235934 the local optometrist will be handing out most of the glasses for free
7235935 its great that there are people back in the states that are willing to help the people out here
7235936 by helping the people they are also helping our mission to aid the iraqis in rebuilding their infrastructure
7235937 these reports provide further evidence of the persisting problems with the 2006 nhs dental reforms
7235938 the government must take note of what these reports patients and the profession and even the health select committee have told them and act to resolve the issues facing nhs dentistry in england and wales it is also important that primary care trusts and dentists are properly resourced and supported to ensure the commissioning work they are doing is effective and meets patients needs
7235939 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7235940 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7235941 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7235942 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7235943 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7235944 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7235945 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7235946 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
7235947 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
7235948 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
7235949 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
7235950 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health

7235953 reporting quality data on the care provided hospital patients is a key to our continuing effort to provide better value based health care for all americans
7235954 expanding the scope of measures is making hospital compare a more valuable tool for all health care consumers
7235955 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
7235956 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
7235957 the 30 day medicare mortality data will strengthen quality improvement partnerships in hospitals by encouraging better handoffs and communication
7235958 the start of the clinical study for pmx 30063 represents a major milestone for polymedix and we believe for the entire medical community
7235959 this novel antibiotic compound signals a fundamental potential breakthrough in treating infectious diseases pmx 30063 is the first and only small molecule defensin mimetic to commence clinical development for the treatment of systemic infections and the first and only such compound whose mechanism of action is intended to directly address the major problem of bacterial drug resistance we are proud to be the first company to bring this completely new type of antibiotic to clinical trials and to address a major clinical need and market opportunity

7235967 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7235968 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7235969 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7235970 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
7235971 this has been a long and hard fight but the nurses were determined to win the patient care protections that allow us to provide safe quality care that our community deserves
7235972 other improvements such as better retirement and salaries that bring us up to par with bay area standards will greatly assist us in recruiting as well as retaining experienced rns
7235973 the unity and commitment of sutter rns throughout northern california to win safe staffing through designated meal and break relief nurses has made this a reality

7235977 education is at the heart of successful interventions to improve the publics health this new resource aims to raise awareness and understanding of hpv and cervical cancer within a broader sexual health context and empower young people to take informed action to protect their health
7235978 the thirst for information is overwhelming over 50 000 copies of the societys general information leaflet have been requested and it is predicted nearly half of all secondary schools across the uk will be directly reached by the teaching amp learning resource
7235979 immunisation and vaccination provide an essential tool in improving public health and the introduction of the hpv vaccination programme is a hugely significant step however success requires an investment not just in vaccine delivery but also in the health promotion measures necessary to create a supportive educational and organizational environment education is not an add on but a pre requisite
7235980 this is an excellent example of collaboration between a charity and the private sector which has very much been in the public interest we have also ensured close consultation with the public sector all in all this is a high quality resource to meet a high public demand for information
7235981 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
7235982 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
7235983 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
7235984 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
7235985 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
7235986 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
7235987 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
7235988 what can i say he is my friend and apart from that he is a great professional a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now hes experienced and he is only 26
7235989 dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are two of my best friends in football and i wish them all the best
7235990 i speak to them every week and i know how they feel i am not going to tell you but
7235991 this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it
7235992 i dont want to lose it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for
7235993 when you see football all around the world you see very few teams who play the way that we play
7235994 i just enjoy it i feel it is my home now
7235995 i am happy with everything my number four playing for
7235996 based upon retinal physicians feedback there remains a significant unmet medical need for a treatment for wet amd that can reliably improve visual acuity over time without the need for monthly intravitreal injections
7235997 we are excited about these study findings and the potential for vegf trap eye to fulfill this need pending the results of our ongoing phase 3 clinical studies
7235998 the 52 week results underline that vegf trap eye has the potential to significantly reduce retinal thickness and improve vision
7235999 the further development of this compound is important for millions of people worldwide who suffer from this devastating ocular disease
7236000 the audit painted a bleak picture of specialist healthcare services for people with a learning disability we hope our follow up programme of work announced today will keep the spotlight on those services so we can look back on this time as a turning point for people with a learning disability
7236001 if we dont keep the pressure up we risk being in the same place in the future talking about the same problems indeed i expect to see that services have already improved when we begin the follow up visits
7236002 as part of maintaining the focus in this area all nhs learning disability services will this year be assessed against key indicators focusing on the quality of services for individuals as part of the annual performance assessment
7236003 but providing services is only one part of the picture thats why we are working in partnership with csci and mhac to carry out a review of how services are commissioned on behalf of people with learning disabilities
7236004 parkinsons disease is a devastating illness for those patients whose symptoms are no longer well controlled by medication alone
7236005 we are very pleased to initiate this study which may offer a new therapeutic option that is potentially disease modifying and more consistent with the brains normal metabolic activity
7236006 as a training ground for highly talented individuals who will transform health and health care the fellowship provides the tools and resources they will need to develop expertise in health policy and politics
7236007 working hand in hand with the best and brightest in federal health policy the fellows gain an insiders perspective of the political process and develop unmatched leadership skills
7236008 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well

7236010 there were some complications but now that everything is resolved i am really happy
7236011 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7236012 andriy returns to the rossoneri tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical then he will sign a contract and from tuesday he will be available to carlo ancelotti
7236013 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt
7236014 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7236015 i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in their squad
7236016 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy
7236017 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7236018 between today and tomorrow andriy will be in milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7236019 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7236020 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7236021 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7236022 of course it is a setback but the result is there and we have to make up for it by winning the next match we have a big game on wednesday in the champions league and need to improve
7236023 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7236024 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7236025 i thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style
7236026 it is dangerous to invite teams especially teams of this quality on to you but thats what we did in the end the ball was in and around our penalty area far too much
7236027 i dont want this to sound too critical though ive seen the best defensive performance by us since ive been here but i like best the
7236028 to be fair its heartening that when our backs are against the wall we can produce the necessary fighting spirit
7236029 i had him for a year and a half at viking stavanger in norway and hes still a good player both defensively and at set pieces

7236351 das olympische dorf war gro artig die wettkampfst tten erstklassig die organisation makellos
7236352 aber wir k nnen durch den sport zu positiven ver nderungen beitragen und tun dies auch
7236353 wir fanden es ungew hnlich dass keiner dieser proteste stattfand
7236354 ich glaube das internationale olympische komitee hat sehr viel an glaubw rdigkeit eingeb t und es h tte sehr viel mehr auch konsequent fordernd auftreten k nnen und auftreten m ssen
7236355 es waren gro e sch ne olympische sportspiele aber eine fassade was die verdeckung von unterdr ckung von demokratischen rechten angeht

7236373 no obvious signs of any injury that could have caused his death

7236383 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7236384 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7236385 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7236386 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7236387 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7236388 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7236389 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7236390 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7236391 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7236392 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7236393 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7236394 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7236395 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7236396 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7236397 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all

7236407 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7236408 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7236409 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7236410 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7236411 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week
7236412 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7236413 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries

7236415 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7236416 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7236417 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7236418 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7236419 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7236420 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7236421 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7236422 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7236423 mas ei n o era assim que c digo da vinci come ava
7236424 porra o cara s sabe come ar livro desse jeito
7236425 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7236426 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7236427 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7236428 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7236429 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7236430 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7236431 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7236432 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7236433 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7236434 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7236435 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7236436 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7236437 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7236438 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7236439 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7236440 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7236441 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7236442 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7236443 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7236444 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7236445 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7236446 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7236447 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7236448 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7236449 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7236450 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7236451 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7236452 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7236453 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7236454 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7236455 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7236456 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7236457 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7236458 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7236459 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7236460 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7236461 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7236462 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7236463 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7236464 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7236465 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7236466 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7236467 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7236468 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7236469 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7236470 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7236471 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7236472 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7236473 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7236474 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7236475 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7236476 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7236477 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7236478 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7236479 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7236480 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7236481 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7236482 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7236483 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7236484 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7236485 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7236486 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7236487 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7236488 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7236489 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7236490 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7236491 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7236492 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7236493 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7236494 these four lawmakers have worked tirelessly to address georgias critical transportation needs
7236495 we commend them for moving the ball on this important issue and we anticipate significant progress toward a solution in 2009 this is a problem that simply must be resolved for the sake of nearly 10 million people who live in georgia and the millions more who will join them in the next several years
7236496 looking ahead get georgia moving and our legislative champions are even more united and determined to pass legislation in 2009
7236497 now more than ever georgia needs a transportation stimulus package to provide mobility jobs and prosperity in both rural and urban georgia our coalition is committed to working with the governor house senate and all stakeholders to find the right stimulus and funding policies for georgia
7236498 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7236499 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7236500 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7236501 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7236502 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7236503 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7236504 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7236505 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7236506 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7236507 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7236508 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7236509 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7236510 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7236511 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7236512 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7236513 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7236514 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7236515 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7236516 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7236517 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7236518 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7236519 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7236520 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7236521 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7236522 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7236523 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7236524 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7236525 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7236526 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7236527 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7236528 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7236529 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7236530 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7236531 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7236532 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7236533 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7236534 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7236535 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7236536 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7236537 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7236538 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7236539 zu dieser musik kann man noch nicht mal seine autoschl ssel suchen
7236540 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7236541 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7236542 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7236543 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7236544 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7236545 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7236546 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7236547 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7236548 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7236549 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7236550 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7236551 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7236552 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7236553 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7236554 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7236555 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7236556 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

7236561 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7236562 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7236563 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7236564 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7236565 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7236566 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7236567 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7236568 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7236569 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7236570 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7236571 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7236572 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7236573 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7236574 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7236575 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7236576 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7236577 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7236578 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7236579 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7236580 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7236581 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7236582 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7236583 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7236584 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7236585 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7236586 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7236587 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7236588 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7236589 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7236590 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7236591 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo

7236599 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7236600 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7236601 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7236602 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7236603 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7236604 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7236605 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7236606 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7236607 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7236608 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7236609 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7236610 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7236611 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7236612 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7236613 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7236614 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7236615 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7236616 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7236617 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7236618 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7236619 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7236620 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected

7236622 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7236623 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7236624 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7236625 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7236626 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7236627 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7236628 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7236629 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7236630 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7236631 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

7236642 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7236643 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7236644 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7236645 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7236646 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7236647 i am wearing the solid gold watch and looking pimp shot
7236648 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7236649 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7236650 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7236651 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7236652 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7236653 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7236654 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7236655 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7236656 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7236657 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7236658 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7236659 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7236660 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7236661 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7236662 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7236663 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7236664 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7236665 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7236666 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7236667 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7236668 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7236669 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7236670 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

7236695 non andremo mai nel pdl e naturalmente lo diciamo ai camerati un po ingenui meno che mai nella destra di storace siamo e resteremo fiamma tricolore
7236696 leggere certe affermazioni da parte di un ormai ex dirigente nazionale fanno veramente pensare specialmente quando si al corrente che quello che stai dicendo non e assolutamente vero
7236697 la cosiddetta destra libertaria composta dagli stessi che avevano gi tradito in campagna elettorale lunica novit che a fare compagnia ai traditori la solita nipote assieme a un deputato europeo del partito di berlusconi

7236704 abbiamo deciso di seguire buona parte della base della fiamma tricolore che ora ha traslocato nel movimento casa pound italia
7236705 siamo stufi di essere presi in giro da una dirigenza nazionale incopetente arrogantee degna di venire paragonata alla precedente gestione dellonpino rauti
7236706 casa pound italia rappresenta al pieno tutte le nostre aspirazioni ideologiche politiche e per questo intendiamo seguire lesempio avanguardista delle occupazioni non conforme romane ci sentiamo di promettere sin da ora la nascita di un centro libraio non conforme e di una associazione culturale al fine di poter dare vita a progetti sociali e culturali al servizio della cittadinanza a partire dal prossimo ottobre

7236729 e ormai inprocastinabile oltre la convocazione dellesecutivo politico nazionale e lo chieder io stesso oggi al segretario nazionale storace per chiarire le affermazioni della nostra portavoce santanche pubblicate oggi sui quotidiani nazionali
7236730 metti tre fascisti in una stanza e dopo una settimana avranno fondato quattro partiti
7236731 mentre quella allinterno della ft la vedo ormai di retroguardia

7236733 c stata fumata bianca si va ha spiegato verso un pdl equilibrato e coeso
7236734 an ha il 30 di rappresentanti mentre forza italia il 70 che include per anche i partiti minori in modo da realizzare velocemente questo percorso
7236735 nel percorso verso la nascita del pdl fermo restando quanto stabilito nel documento di intesa tra berlusconi e fini di febbraio 2008 in un incontro con il presidente berlusconi il ministro la russa e lonorevole verdini al quale stato invitato anche il segretario della dca gianfranco rotondi si proceduto a definire un comitato costituente del pdl che oltre ai promotori an e fi vedr la partecipazione di tutti i soggetti che hanno gi dato vita a liste comuni a camera e senato
7236736 in particolare scritto nella nota nellorganismo presieduto da verdini e la russa in cui an sar rappresentata al 30 dei partecipanti saranno rappresentate oltre ovviamente a forza italia tutte le formazioni politiche che gi fanno parte dei gruppi parlamentari comuni del pdl e stata fissata per il 10 settembre la riunione del comitato costituente a roma mentre per il 18 agosto la prima riunione della commissione statuto che dovr redigere la bozza di regole comuni del pdl
7236737 il voto conferito a un partito utile quando viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito inutile quando non viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito dannoso quando viene utilizzato per il fine opposto a quello per il quale stato conferito votare per il mio partito utile perch il mio partito chiede voti per lopposizione a tutti i livelli e li utilizza per lopposizione a tutti i livelli lei da buon democratico mi insegna che in democrazia lopposizione tanto importante quanto il governo a condizione che si tratti di una vera opposizione e non di una sceneggiata come quella che in questo momento recitano le false opposizioni che dicono di combattere il governo e i partiti di governo ma la tempo stesso lottizzano con il governo e i partiti di governo le posizioni di potere quanto al frigorifero noi manteniamo intatti i voti che riceviamo perch li utilizziamo con fedelt e coerenza e non ce ne serviamo per baratti di alcun genere
7236738 io penso e affermo che fuori dalla vera legittimit costituzionale si pongono quei partiti che rifiutano di attivare gli articoli sociali della costituzione 39 40 e 46 che interpretano in maniera distorta larticolo 49 e dal pluralismo fanno nascere il mostro che si chiama partitocrazia penso e affermo che fuori della costituzione siano quei partiti che lottizzano in termini di potere e quindi di arbitrio la libert di informazione attraverso il mezzo radio televisivo le chiedo anche se abbia avuto modo di conoscere i lineamenti del sistema da noi posto in alternativa presidente della repubblica eletto direttamente dal popolo presidente del consiglio e ministri nominati dal presidente della repubblica senza forcipe di partiti e senza manuali cencelli parlamento eletto direttamente e pluralisticamente ma con la partecipazione di rappresentanze elette delle categorie del mondo del lavoro della produzione della tecnica della cultura e dellarte tutto questo solo idealismo se fosse ne sarei orgoglioso ma io sono fiero di ben altro isolato nei confronti di un paese legale sempre pi lontano dal paese reale ho lorgoglio di essere sempre pi vicino alle esigenze alle speranze e quindi alla comprensione del paese reale cio del popolo italiano
7236739 che strana domanda dottor montanelli ma come pu saltarle in mente visto che lei un uomo che crede nella libert che il segretario di un partito possa dissolvere il suo partito e possa addirittura dopo averlo dissolto farne confluire i voti in altre direzioni centinaia di migliaia di iscritti e almeno due milioni di elettori ma in questo momento siamo di pi dovrebbero obbedire al dittatore almirante per accettare da un momento allaltro di dissolversi e poi di confluire dissolversi cio scomparire come fatto politico come fatto di coscienza come fatto morale come fatto di impegno fisico e spirituale confluire cio abbracciare unaltra fede unaltra dottrina un altro e molto diverso credo politico rinnegando dun colpo se stessi

7236799 it means picking vibrant wide players rather than starting with david beckham when he cant get forward as he used to it means banging steven gerrard and frank lampards heads together and getting them to play as a unit because they can

7236835 in the sydney olympics handball was voted the most popular spectator sport
7236836 but their handball association wasnt ready for the demand that followed they had one man and a dog in the office and they were getting 6 000 calls a day they couldnt deal with it and the chance to develop in australia died
7236837 were already putting plans in place to ensure that doesnt happen
7236838 take it from me london 2012 really will bring a legacy for our sport

7236848 i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so once so deplored
7236849 you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency

7236857 oh my god dont tell me the footnote went astray
7236858 its a technical problem the kind of thing that happens every day it shouldnt happen but it does
7236859 as an academician he should have been concerned about the ethical aspects as an editor he should have checked the information for any inaccuracies and taken the authors to task for such major wrongdoing
7236860 reference proprietary information which we prefer not to make public
7236861 this matter is on the back burner for the time being and no permanent decision has been made as yet
7236862 ik wil iedereen feliciteren voor de moed de olympische geest en de ploeggeest
7236863 onze slogan van one team one dream was meer dan een slogan we hebben twee schitterende medailles maar in een reeks disciplines was het heel wat minder we hebben ons doel niet bereikt en hebben veel werk voor de boeg de sport in belgi is de laatste vier jaar wel vooruitgegaan maar in de andere landen hebben ze nog meer progressie geboekt de kloof is groter dan ooit dus dit is een wake up call
7236864 de medailles op het einde be nvloeden de situatie natuurlijk positief maar het is evident dat we ontgoocheld zijn over het collectieve resultaat
7236865 de enkele prachtprestaties mogen echter niet verzinken in de ontgoocheling maar de objectieven zijn inderdaad niet behaald van de 98 aanwezige atleten eindigden er 43 in de top 8 en dat is onder de 50 die we voor ogen hadden we mogen echter ook de belgische en persoonlijke records niet vergeten maar door de globalisering zijn er meer en meer landen sterker en wij zullen onze mouwen moeten opstropen om de kloof te dichten
7236866 vooral omdat ze behaald zijn in de nummer 1 sport dat betekent dat we nog dingen kunnen bereiken met competentie ambitie en aanpak ik hoop dat we nu tot concrete acties kunnen komen
7236867 op lange termijn moet er eerst en vooral een echte sportcultuur komen we moeten de bevolking mobiliseren om aan sport te doen
7236868 ten tweede moet er op het gebied van topsport een cultuur van uitmuntendheid komen dit kan enkel via verdere professionalisering het aanwenden van meer topcoaches en het meer gebruik maken van medisch wetenschappelijke en technische begeleiding tot slot hebben we ook meer en betere sportinfrastructuur nodig de middelen voor dit alles hebben we maar in andere landen hebben ze er meer en bij ons moeten ze effici nter gebruikt worden
7236869 dit alles moet morgen starten want de voorbereiding op londen 2012 start dan al
7236870 voor het einde van het jaar willen we met alle actoren van belgi rond de tafel zitten waarbij we ten eerste eindelijk de rol en de verantwoordelijkheid van iedereen in de topsport moeten identificeren dat moet ervoor zorgen dat we eindelijk het leven van de atleet en de coach kunnen vereenvoudigen ten tweede moeten we per sport concrete doelen vooropstellen en evaluatiemomenten en criteria vastleggen het boic is dus bereid om zn verantwoordelijkheid te nemen maar zeker voor het einde van het jaar moeten deze dingen uitgeklaard worden anders wordt het in 2012 niet beter dan in 2008
7236871 deze week hebben we verscheidene contacten gehad met de beleidsmakers en die waren toch hoopgevend in die zin misschien is het na ef van mij om dit te denken maar ik hoop het niet

7236875 noi lo chiediamo con forza c una coesione nella maggioranza e ci auguriamo anche una disponibilit della sinistra
7236876 e previsto che ci sia anche questa tranche il superamento del bicameralismo perfetto con la realizzazione di un senato federale accompaganto da una riduzione del numero dei parlamentari ma limportante approvare il federalismo fiscale senza il quale non ci sono le risorse per far funzionare le riforme costituzionali
7236877 e da discutere se prendiamo come riferimento la bozza violante prevede che il premier abbia pi poteri ad esempio anche quello di revocare i ministri e poi che venga nominato dal presidente della repubblica tenendo conto del risultato delle elezioni c cos una costituzionalizzazione di quello che oggi gi di fatto
7236878 lo vedremo abbiamo sempre pensato che la corte costituzionale dovesse essere rappresentativa anche delle regioni e dei territori
7236879 su sicurezza e immigrazione siamo impegnati il ministro maroni ha lavorato molto bene dobbiamo sostenere lazione del governo nellapplicazione della legge bossi fini sullimmigrazione e un maggiore controllo bisogna arrivare allapplicazione a regime di tutti i suoi principi e dei provvedimenti necessari nellesercitare lazione di contrasto si tratta di provvedimenti che il governo varer per assicurare la certezza della pena contenuti nel pacchetto sicurezza
7236880 spingiamo anche per un federalismo sulla sicurezza la chiave di volta quindi sempre pi poteri ai sindaci su questo andremo avanti
7236881 porteremo in parlamento il dibattito su come andr impostata la scuola in futuro primo punto concorsi completamente regionalizzati cos la finiamo con la migrazione del personale da sud a nord e in questo modo ci sar anche un personale che conoscer meglio la realt del territorio secondo punto dibattito sui libri di testo in un momento di crisi come questo i continui cambiamenti dei testi sono una cosa assurda chiederemo che vengano mantenuti per lintero ciclo scolatisco almeno cinque anni obbligatoriamente i testi devono durare non vanno cambiati ogni anno se ci sono variazioni si possono segnalare con delle appendici la corsa al continuo cambio dei libri di testo penalizza soltanto le famiglie
7236882 una mia opinione personale che il testo potrebbe essere fornito dallistituto almeno per la scuola dellobbligo
7236883 se ne parli siamo disponibili facendo riferimento alle norme volute da falcone berlusconi ha iniziato con il piede giusto ci sono tante cose di cui dover parlare un argomento complesso per esempio c il tema della giustizia civile perch un imprenditore che non ha tempi certi per il soddisfacimento dei suoi crediti va in difficolt la competitivit del sistema economico legata anche a una giustizia che consenta di recuperare i propri crediti e di avere ragione in sede civile
7236884 noi siamo sempre stati a favore della separazione delle carriere si discuter di tutto

7236895 if you have a right to health care can you legally compel someone to practice medicine if they choose not to
7236896 you have a right to work not to rob others of the fruits of their work not to turn others into sacrificial rightless animals laboring to fulfill your needs
7236897 if you work even for minimum wage you should have the same access to health care as the richest man in the country it is only fair
7236898 if fixing your car gets too expensive you cant just fix your toaster instead
7236899 if fixing your water pipe gets too expensive you cant just fix your window latch instead

7236911 between the mou the design standards which will be adopted by the planning board and the zoning bylaw i feel the towns interest will be protected

7236928 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
7236929 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
7236930 the process that begun once she had actually applied the chlorine was partly transparent and clear and simple to her and partly a complete mystery it was in essence she knew an orderly process there was something then there was nothing but inside its own parameters

7236940 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7236941 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7236942 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
7236943 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
7236944 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight

7236947 une r cession technique de l conomie fran aise soit deux trimestres cons cutifs de croissance n gatifs est possible
7236948 la france est elle au bord de la r cession
7236949 les deux moteurs de la croissance fran aise la consommation et linvestissement sont en panne du fait de la hausse de linflation et de l rosion de la croissance des revenus
7236950 il y a des raisons de penser que la fin 2008 sera meilleure
7236951 un l ger mieux est attendu partir de la mi 2009 la faveur de la dissipation de la plupart des facteurs n gatifs qui ont pes sur la croissance fran aise
7236952 un euro plus faible et une stabilisation des prix des mati res premi res ne seront sans doute pas suffisants pour compenser le recul attendu de la demande interne et nous pensons donc que la france est entr e dans une p riode de tr s faible croissance qui pourrait entra ner une remont e du ch mage
7236953 la plupart des facteurs qui avaient permis un redressement de lactivit partir de la fin 2005 apr s le ralentissement de 2001 2002 connaissent des volutions d favorables

7236955 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7236956 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7236957 wir haben heute morgen etwas zeit gefunden und ich hatte schon vor der session das gef hl dass es f r die pole reichen k nnte ich wusste dass ich in den letzten zwei runden hart attackieren muss als die session neu gestartet wurde
7236958 sie haben im moment ein st rkeres paket auch wenn ihre fahrer nat rlich gute arbeit leisten
7236959 meiner meinung nach liegt toro rosso nach den vergangenen paar rennen nun definitiv vor red bull
7236960 wenn der toro rosso konkurrenzf hig ist dann wissen wir dass sebastian in den top positionen zu finden ist das war eine gro artige leistung ein gro artiges wochenende ich denke dass sie im rennen eine sehr gro e chance haben viele punkte zu holen dies ist nun ein weiterer gegner den wir haben
7236961 er k nnte sich w nschen dass er kommendes jahr einen ferrari motor unter seinem hintern wei
7236962 das gesamte team inklusive mir waren berrascht wie schnell wir im qualifying fahren konnten
7236963 wenn es daf r eine erkl rung gibt oder man einen grund h ren m chte dann denke ich dass die antwort darauf lautet dass wir perfekte arbeit geleistet haben wir haben 100 prozent unseres potenzials genutzt keine fehler gemacht und das muss auch f r die zukunft unser ziel sein
7236964 wenn es ein problem gibt oder etwas das der fahrer nicht so sehr mag oder uns auf der strecke einschr nkt dann wissen wir wie wir dieses problem angehen k nnen das k nnte ein grund sein warum wir hier so stark sind
7236965 es gibt keinen grund dort herum zu spielen oder etwas zu verstecken dort fahren alle leer es war aus diesem grund sehr berraschend und sehr positiv in der dritten qualifying einheit h tten wir eine position weiter vorn stehen sollen aber ich leistete mir auf dem letzten versuch einen fehler f r den start ist dies jedoch eine gute position

7236967 es ist nicht so dass man drei vier oder f nf zehntelsekunden nur dem motor zuschreiben kann angesichts des reglements liegen meiner meinung nach alle motoren hersteller eng beieinander vielleicht hat ein motor auf einer bestimmten strecke einen vorteil das h ngt von der charakteristik ab aber meiner meinung nach spielen mehr dinge eine schl sselrolle die aerodynamische effizienz welches paket du verwendest und wie viel abtrieb du einsetzt
7236968 ich denke dass dies stimmt aber wie ich schon gesagt habe ist es schwierig zu sagen ob man nur wegen des motors zeit gutmacht es gibt drei unterschiedliche teams die einen ferrari motor einsetzen manchmal liegen sie eng zusammen manchmal weit auseinander das h ngt von vielen verschiedenen dingen ab
7236969 aber wir haben ein gutes auto und ich bin zuversichtlich ich bleibe mit beiden beinen auf dem boden das rennen erfordert jede menge konzentration
7236970 my semi final round loss today was totally unjustified the controversial ruling shows that fila the sports governing body international amateur wrestling federation does not play fair
7236971 we limit ourselves to ruling that fila must consistent with the olympic charter and general principles of fairness establish for the future a jury of appeal to determine the validity or otherwise of complaints of the kind ventilated by abrahamian

7236984 hes really performed well for tasmania in the past couple of years particularly in one day cricket
7236985 he really deserves his chance i dont know him that well so im looking forward to that
7236986 he can swing the new ball and get the old ball to reverse a little bit
7236987 generally he hits the pitch very hard hes very disciplined and hes also a very handy lower order hitter as well hes got some good assets to bring to our team
7236988 we played the whole world cup without brett and that was a big loss but it gave shaun tait an opportunity to stamp his name on the world scene
7236989 not having brett there does give someone else an opportunity to really put their hand up and show that they can perform at the highest level
7236990 having said that bretts our spearhead and we want him back as quickly as possibly
7236991 taits in good spirits i believe hes been training with the south australian team and again were hoping he can come back as quickly as possible
7236992 this bangladesh series is going to be a little bit rusty weve had a little bit of time off
7236993 its going to be very important that we use this bangladesh series very well
7236994 theyve really improved a lot theyve got an australian coach in jamie siddons so they will know us pretty well
7236995 the guys are going to be very keen we havent played for a while now its been a good break since the west indies all the guys are jumping out of their skin and cant wait to get stuck into it
7236996 la scuola devessere materia di integrazione ma devesserlo senza transigere dal suo ruolo e senza esagerare nel buonismo
7236997 il taglio di 85 mila insegnanti previsto tra il 2009 e il 2011 nella scuola italiana e significativo siamo tutti preoccupati ma chi lo critica indichi una strada diversa
7236998 non sara un sette in condotta a punire i bulli a scuola ma un cinque
7236999 siamo un paese turistico e settembre ha detto gelmini e un bel mese
7237000 credo sia corretto che una famiglia possa scegliere la scuola piu adatta al proprio figlio
7237001 aumenteremo le ore degli insegnanti ha detto gelmini durante il dibattito pubblico svolto in serata ma anche giusto dar loro gli strumenti per svolgere il proprio ruolo e un riconoscimento sociale reinvestiremo i soldi recuperati dagli sprechi e dal taglio sulle spese per il personale premiando chi raggiunger i migliori risultati
7237002 la scuola deve alzare la propria qualit abbassata dalle scuole del sud
7237003 in sicilia puglia calabria e basilicata organizzeremo corsi intensivi per gli insegnanti
7237004 le famiglie non devono fare i sindacalisti dei ragazzi ci deve essere una correlazione rispetto alla funzione educativa la famiglia deve stare dalla parte dellinsegnante altrimenti ha concluso il ministro il ragazzo a farne le spese

7237018 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
7237019 his contract situation was dragging on and hes had an opportunity to move back home and play for a local club
7237020 i think now in my heart of the people who are close to me and especially the fans who came to china to cheer for me at the olympics
7237021 those things gave me the power to get the gold medal
7237022 this gold medal means a lot to my nation and to my people this gold medal belongs to all of them
7237023 in the 2007 world championships it was my first big tournament in my life in the gold medal match i was nervous and i didnt perform to my best
7237024 the veteran boxers on the team suggested i have to fight freely and with self confidence from the first round of the games i did getting lots of points from the early fights right until the end
7237025 i want to participate in them and get my name known to the world
7237026 in the second round we hit each other and after that i couldnt raise my hands
7237027 i hurt the shoulder in kazakstan in march during the qualifications then i hurt it again against the cuban yampier hernandez in the semifinal match
7237028 i was aware of the pain when i entered the ring
7237029 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7237030 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7237031 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7237032 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7237033 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7237034 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7237035 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7237036 very firmly in the belief it was the right choice to come to china and these games have been enormously successful on a number of fronts
7237037 i have received e mails from people across the country particularly about the relays they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
7237038 we knew it was going to be hard and this was a rude awakening
7237039 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7237040 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7237041 exploring a foreign country improves our understanding of the world and adds some spice to the routine of daily life but what if the mark you left on that country benefited a small village not found in any travel guide and the greatest souvenir you took home was the unmistakable feeling of being part of something larger than yourself

7237043 now i am in italy now i am in france
7237044 now im ready to tell you why i want to play
7237045 its about winning with dignity its showing humility showing respect for the game and the people in the game internationally
7237046 we stayed at the soccer matches to see the u s women get their gold medals just to see what that was going to be like
7237047 we had our flag and we were holding our flag and waving it around just to support them just to see their families how they interacted with them with the emotion that comes along with that
7237048 months and months and months of preparation it was good for us to see that and draw inspiration from that
7237049 we are very very proud of the way our players have conducted themselves how engaging theyve been during the entire olympics they scored a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10
7237050 the last eight years have been talked about as you know this is not our game anymore were nothing but showboat players all the bad things that have been said about nba players about team usa
7237051 were 40 minutes away from shutting that all up thatll be good
7237052 and i loved it up there til it got cold
7237053 if theyre taking steps unilaterally then what we can do it looks like the peoples party wants to break ties with us
7237054 if you look at the parameters of pakistani politics theyre real fears and ive been fearing a lot that theyll go back to that kind of confrontation
7237055 eight members of the 2nd royal regiment of fusiliers have provided positive samples as part of the armys compulsory drug testing programme
7237056 the army treats drug taking very seriously and appropriate action is being taken against all eight soldiers
7237057 most are experience men who should know better its taken the shine off what should be proud days for the battalion
7237058 at this point in time we are not able to give personal details about the couple or the circumstances of how they got into the water
7237059 if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature
7237060 this might be a good time to take another look
7237061 ik wil iedereen feliciteren voor de moed de olympische geest en de ploeggeest
7237062 onze slogan van one team one dream was meer dan een slogan we hebben twee schitterende medailles maar in een reeks disciplines was het heel wat minder we hebben ons doel niet bereikt en hebben veel werk voor de boeg de sport in belgi is de laatste vier jaar wel vooruitgegaan maar in de andere landen hebben ze nog meer progressie geboekt de kloof is groter dan ooit dus dit is een wake up call
7237063 de medailles op het einde be nvloeden de situatie natuurlijk positief maar het is evident dat we ontgoocheld zijn over het collectieve resultaat
7237064 de enkele prachtprestaties mogen echter niet verzinken in de ontgoocheling maar de objectieven zijn inderdaad niet behaald van de 98 aanwezige atleten eindigden er 43 in de top 8 en dat is onder de 50 die we voor ogen hadden we mogen echter ook de belgische en persoonlijke records niet vergeten maar door de globalisering zijn er meer en meer landen sterker en wij zullen onze mouwen moeten opstropen om de kloof te dichten
7237065 vooral omdat ze behaald zijn in de nummer 1 sport dat betekent dat we nog dingen kunnen bereiken met competentie ambitie en aanpak ik hoop dat we nu tot concrete acties kunnen komen
7237066 op lange termijn moet er eerst en vooral een echte sportcultuur komen we moeten de bevolking mobiliseren om aan sport te doen
7237067 ten tweede moet er op het gebied van topsport een cultuur van uitmuntendheid komen dit kan enkel via verdere professionalisering het aanwenden van meer topcoaches en het meer gebruik maken van medisch wetenschappelijke en technische begeleiding tot slot hebben we ook meer en betere sportinfrastructuur nodig de middelen voor dit alles hebben we maar in andere landen hebben ze er meer en bij ons moeten ze effici nter gebruikt worden
7237068 dit alles moet morgen starten want de voorbereiding op londen 2012 start dan al
7237069 voor het einde van het jaar willen we met alle actoren van belgi rond de tafel zitten waarbij we ten eerste eindelijk de rol en de verantwoordelijkheid van iedereen in de topsport moeten identificeren dat moet ervoor zorgen dat we eindelijk het leven van de atleet en de coach kunnen vereenvoudigen ten tweede moeten we per sport concrete doelen vooropstellen en evaluatiemomenten en criteria vastleggen het boic is dus bereid om zn verantwoordelijkheid te nemen maar zeker voor het einde van het jaar moeten deze dingen uitgeklaard worden anders wordt het in 2012 niet beter dan in 2008
7237070 deze week hebben we verscheidene contacten gehad met de beleidsmakers en die waren toch hoopgevend in die zin misschien is het na ef van mij om dit te denken maar ik hoop het niet
7237071 het is duidelijk dat ze ontvoerd zijn want hun planning was om terug te zijn in het hotel voor 12 uur en we weten niet waar ze zich nu bevinden

7237076 a ten per cent increase is possible if the fuel prices do not come down significantly the indian aviation industry has suffered a collective loss of about one billion us dollars last year
7237077 we see things improving but we are not at all out of the woods
7237078 the room to manoeuvre at this moment is limited any marginal changes in the prices will not enable us to make any significant move
7237079 marginal and that reduction is not reflected in the prices charged by our fuel companies you have the currency effect also we will see how oil companies price aviation turbine fuel atf by the end of this month or the first week of next month

7237088 what they will hear is some really practical information about how they can impact the welfare of children every day
7237089 at the end of the summit we are going to have a call to action and see if we can get some folks in the community to agree to meet with us and help us to put together a child abuse prevention campaign
7237090 its just as hard for kids if they dont have something in their stomach
7237091 they cant understand why you wont buy them the snacks
7237092 right now we see the stresses in the economy causing the numbers of reports to the hotline to go up
7237093 we want to be able to help them before they get in the child welfare system
7237094 i think what i would like the community to know is that child abuse and neglect is in their community
7237095 we need to understand that its throughout the community and that often times if we can impact the general welfare of that child we can stop them from coming into the system
7237096 from the outside the rec looks like a shiny apple but when you look deeper what you see is a rotten apple
7237097 theyve lost their way when it comes to the core principles of the republican platform
7237098 all the people in the republican party are hoping to have a voice in the party and they the current leadership just doent want them to have a voice
7237099 the biggest problem is weve veered away from the party of personal responsibility
7237100 they dinkins and cavanaugh refuse to stand up and act like republicans whatever the party says they just nod in tacit approval

7237106 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7237107 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7237108 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7237109 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be

7237116 le monde est dangereux vivre non pas cause de ceux qui font le mal
7237117 they are just very supportive of my career in making sure that all the decisions are right im not opposed to falling in love
7237118 i seriously think there is a complete perfect prince charming out there for me somewhere someone who has great hair and a completely immature sense of humor and everything that i want i just havent found him yet
7237119 he wasnt listed in the starting team and also wasnt listed on the bench
7237120 i knew that he was warming up before the game so i just asked the referee and roar coach frank farina what was going on they told me he was having a test i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7237121 i was pretty pleased with the way we played both first half and second half
7237122 but as i said to the boys weve got to close those games out if were serious about doing something this year those sorts of ones youve got to close them out when youve got them on the ropes like we had them youve got to do it now particularly with the cancels we had
7237123 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7237124 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7237125 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7237126 i havent really given it any thought at all weve got round 22 to come against essendon
7237127 its obviously pleasing for the club but coaches tend to be so short term so we discussed after the game what we did well what we need to improve
7237128 obviously its an important seven days to recover and we feel we really need to keep improving our football
7237129 thats what today was about against a really good opposition
7237130 its an important prize to have i still think home ground advantage exists in the competition its becoming less but it still exists
7237131 theres that plus it would be nice for us to be able to get it just from our own supporter base for them to be able to see a home final
7237132 little things like gazs tackle and matt prior it just gives you a chance to hold where you are and then we score and it takes you to 22 6
7237133 the difference between 16 12 and 22 6 is obviously a huge advantage because the scoreboard builds pressure more than anything else
7237134 thats what helps you get into a position to do well and win games
7237135 the good stuff that gaz did the pretty stuff and coops scored the nice try that comes on the back of all that other stuff
7237136 we had a couple of really good chances early in the second half where we just couldnt finish them off
7237137 there was just too many mistakes we became bumbling fools by the end of the game
7237138 im probably the most unemotional bloke ever and i saw mum and i couldnt really cuddle her because i was about to well up in tears
7237139 shes going to think i brushed her i kind of gave her a half cuddle and kept walking and said i gotta go im going to cry
7237140 its not a sad day its happy i was very appreciative of how the fans have been to me throughout my career down here
7237141 guys like myself and jason weve never been anything but the merger so its always been just the dragons to us weve always had two home grounds

7237185 he wasnt listed in the starting team and also wasnt listed on the bench
7237186 i knew that he was warming up before the game so i just asked the referee and roar coach frank farina what was going on they told me he was having a test i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7237187 i was pretty pleased with the way we played both first half and second half
7237188 but as i said to the boys weve got to close those games out if were serious about doing something this year those sorts of ones youve got to close them out when youve got them on the ropes like we had them youve got to do it now particularly with the cancels we had
7237189 little things like gazs tackle and matt prior it just gives you a chance to hold where you are and then we score and it takes you to 22 6
7237190 the difference between 16 12 and 22 6 is obviously a huge advantage because the scoreboard builds pressure more than anything else
7237191 thats what helps you get into a position to do well and win games
7237192 the good stuff that gaz did the pretty stuff and coops scored the nice try that comes on the back of all that other stuff
7237193 we had a couple of really good chances early in the second half where we just couldnt finish them off
7237194 there was just too many mistakes we became bumbling fools by the end of the game
7237195 im probably the most unemotional bloke ever and i saw mum and i couldnt really cuddle her because i was about to well up in tears
7237196 shes going to think i brushed her i kind of gave her a half cuddle and kept walking and said i gotta go im going to cry
7237197 its not a sad day its happy i was very appreciative of how the fans have been to me throughout my career down here
7237198 i havent really given it any thought at all weve got round 22 to come against essendon
7237199 its obviously pleasing for the club but coaches tend to be so short term so we discussed after the game what we did well what we need to improve
7237200 obviously its an important seven days to recover and we feel we really need to keep improving our football
7237201 thats what today was about against a really good opposition
7237202 its an important prize to have i still think home ground advantage exists in the competition its becoming less but it still exists
7237203 theres that plus it would be nice for us to be able to get it just from our own supporter base for them to be able to see a home final
7237204 si dovrebbe assimilare i colori della vita ma non ricordarne i particolari

7237206 all year long people send us frustrating examples of celebrities promoting something that makes no sense once its done its really difficult to undo we know some people arent interested in good science or evidence we are equally sure some will be glad to talk through claims they are asked to front because they take their public impact seriously or just for their own self preservation
7237207 radioactivity cannot be neutralised it can only be moved from one place to another until it decays away at its own rate there are no magical solutions
7237208 i was alarmed at the idea of three diseases being injected into her system in one go i thought bloody hell thats an awful lot for this tiny thing
7237209 the worst fallacies are ones that sound as if they ought to be true but sometimes common sense is nonsense even tiny babies immune systems handle many new infections at once no problem the best advice is avoid needless risk by protecting children with full prompt immunisation
7237210 we cannot go on force feeding animals chemicals and growth stimulants the way we are why do you think cancer is roaring ahead at the moment
7237211 cancer is not roaring ahead it is more common mostly because people are living longer it is essential that cancer causing claims are based only on scientifically proven facts not scaremongering
7237212 a whole host of unwanted chemicals find their way into our bodies all the time
7237213 most leave quickly but some stay asbestos and silica in our lungs dioxins in our blood do they matter no the most important thing is dose one aspirin cures a headache a hundred kills
7237214 celebrities can have a huge influence on the public but they need to make sure they are doing more good than harm by checking their facts
7237215 pointing out that these latter day emperors have no clothes is not merely a pleasure its an urgent necessity
7237216 every day theres a new report warning that obesity levels in children are out of control the fact that those kids who drink the most milk gain the most weight should cause alarm bells to be ringing everywhere
7237217 it is not true a us study found no link between increases in child weight and increases in drink consumption
7237218 i mean one of the biggest problems that exists right now in the world is nuclear waste thats something ive been involved with for a while with a group of scientists finding a way to neutralise radiation
7237219 radioactivity cannot be neutralised it can only be moved from one place to another until it decays away at its own rate it comes in many different types some last for billions of years others decay away in a few minutes there are no magical solutions
7237220 each sprouting seed is packed with the nutritional energy needed to create a fullgrown healthy plant
7237221 this is a nice idea gillian but when we eat seeds we dont break down the stored products like a plant does a seed has stored proteins starch and oil that are broken down when water is added to give it the energy and molecular building blocks to start the germination process to become a fully formed plant the seedling then needs sunlight and more water
7237222 he was in serious pain just below the knee and i felt the area above had been traumatised i started feeling and id say within 20 minutes he was walking again it took away the pain
7237223 are you sure the pain relief was due to healing hands we need a trial where the patients are randomly allocated to either the test therapy or a comparison therapy otherwise you cant be sure what happened wasnt due to chance

7237227 i can only say what i have seen is really really cool i think j j abrams was sensible to not just come here with nothing to show the fans i think there was a consensus that yes star trek was going to be here this year neither the new star trek movie nor paramount had a panel at comic con this year and j j made a point of not short changing anybody by just bringing in something that wasnt finished or doing another heres the cast kind of thing and i think its just going to serve to make the anticipation greater when he finally is ready to show something i mean ive seen a little bit and i was screaming i had my hand over my mouth oh my god its so good i just think its going to be huge
7237228 it is fantastic anybody who was worried doesnt need to be worried about this film i cannot talk about it was in very capable hands the director did a phenomenal job the director and his crew top notch cast and the guy that plays the lead is an instant star that dude is going to be
7237229 restrict oversized bags for daytime only as they look cool and chic but to make a statement carry a clutch in the evening
7237230 clutches in gold silver and metallic hues with little embroidery can go with any outfit but it is the neutral bling like dull gold and silver that stands apart
7237231 fashion for me is more about fusion my bags have an indian feel to them as i render them in a more traditional and contemporary manner
7237232 for my bags i use all sorts of woven fabrics like patola and kashid and have fused this with leather to give it a contemporary look
7237233 oversized detailed stitching sleek outer pockets print and textured fabric bags are very much in this season
7237234 most of our bags are accessorized with buckles rings buttons and studs
7237235 bright colours like red black cobalt fuchsia and orange are in but purple simply stands out
7237236 we use italian leather and sometimes nylon for our bags they enhance the durability and longevity of our products

7237244 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
7237245 wan optimisation addresses two classes of problems scarce bandwidth and high latency
7237246 this often reduces the average number of bits transmitted by more than 90 percent for data patterns that have been seen before however this can be misleading since new data patterns are reduced by around 50 percent and compressed or encrypted files see no reduction
7237247 providers add qos features to deal with bursts so high priority traffic can get through yet even in these cases link loads that consistently top 65 percent to 75 percent cause problems that typically require bandwidth upgrades
7237248 we were getting to the point where people were complaining and we were seeing more and more dropped packets on the network
7237249 adding a t1 to a branch office with 700 people costs 1 000 per line it was a better option for us to push more data through the pipe but use wan optimisation to do it which compresses data at a rate of 59 percent to 75 percent

7237371 jeg f lte et pres fra min vejleder om at jeg skulle n mine m l at jeg skulle v re mere ben og mere p men jeg var bange for patienterne og det var en lettelse n r jeg fik at vide at n af dem var flygtet fra afdelingen
7237372 jeg klarede praktikforl bet men herefter gik det ned ad bakke jeg isolerede mig og lavede ikke andet end at g i skole se fjernsyn og sove jeg fors gte alligevel at give n ste semester en chance og jeg bestod det teoretiske forl b med syv eksaminer men i den n ste praktik som var fem m neder p en mave tarm kirurgisk afdeling var jeg et nervevrag
7237373 jeg fik hjertebanken og begyndte at svede jeg var angst for at blive bed mt blive set over skulderen og for at f kritik jeg kunne hverken sige eller lave noget n r min vejleder stod ved siden af mig
7237374 de pr vede at tale med mig om hvad det var der gjorde mig bange men jeg var ikke engang selv klar over hvad rsagen var de vidste ikke hvordan de skulle h ndtere at have en studerende med pr stationsangst
7237375 da jeg fortalte at jeg allerede havde henvendt mig til studenterr dgivningen gjorde skolen ikke mere ved det
7237376 jeg kunne ikke samle mig om at lave noget og havde heller ikke energi eller overskud til det bare det at skulle v re sammen med andre mennesker f eks at g forbi en person p gaden eller at g ud at handle gjorde mig angst
7237377 det hjalp men i begyndelsen kunne jeg ikke engang sige noget af bare angst jeg fik hjertebanken svedte og havde mest af alt lyst til bare at l be ud af lokalet men efter nogle uger bad jeg om at blive skrevet p som en af de f rste der skulle sige noget og langsomt kunne jeg sige mere og mere
7237378 kontrasten mellem at v re indlagt p stolpeg rden og v re hjemme var stor jeg kendte til et ambulant behandlingsforl b p bispebjerg hospital hvor man kommer to gange om ugen i tre timer men for overhovedet at blive henvist var jeg n dt til at g via psykiatrisk skadestue min egen l ge mente ikke at det var n dvendigt med yderligere terapi
7237379 tidligere havde jeg haft ledende funktioner men nu begyndte jeg med nogle enkle arbejdsopgaver n r jeg kunne m rke at jeg kunne klare mere sagde jeg selv til jeg havde en chef der gav mig ro og tid til langsomt at st p egne ben jeg m rkede en accept af at det var o k at der var plads til mig
7237380 ved at fors ge at modbevise angsten er der mindre risiko for at udl se den det er tanken der udl ser angsten derefter kommer de kropslige symptomer og jeg g r i panik
7237381 n r k en ved kassen var meget lang kunne synet af de mange mennesker g re mig s angst at jeg ikke kunne tr kke vejret jeg l rte at vende mig om et jeblik hoste og vente et par minutter s gik det over og jeg kunne forts tte med at betjene kunderne

7237453 dont know what type of job this is job hash
7237454 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7237455 i would really like to see that 4 100m run by the jamaicans written about in this free newspaper
7237456 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7237457 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7237458 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7237459 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7237460 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7237461 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7237462 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7237463 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7237464 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7237465 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7237466 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7237467 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7237468 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7237469 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7237470 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7237471 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7237472 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7237473 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7237474 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7237475 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7237476 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7237477 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7237478 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7237479 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7237480 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7237481 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7237482 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7237483 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7237484 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7237485 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7237486 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7237487 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7237488 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7237489 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7237490 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7237491 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7237492 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7237493 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7237494 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7237495 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7237496 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7237497 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7237498 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7237499 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7237500 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7237501 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7237502 who are open to doing something on the production side
7237503 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7237504 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7237505 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7237506 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7237507 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7237508 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7237509 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7237510 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7237511 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7237512 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7237513 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7237514 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7237515 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7237516 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7237517 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7237518 this prototype shall henceforth be considered to be the unit of mass but measured when leo earth and the sun line up on the first year that our solar system returns from its 226 million year orbital journey
7237519 the inertia of any system is the result of the interaction of that system and the rest of the universe in other words every particle in the universe ultimately has an effect on every other particle

7237551 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7237552 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7237553 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7237554 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7237555 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7237556 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7237557 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7237558 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7237559 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7237560 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7237561 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7237562 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7237563 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7237564 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7237565 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7237566 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7237567 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7237568 abbiamo fatto il massimo commenta il capitano della squadra la romana elisa santoni avevamo pure messo in conto la russia da sempre favorita dalle giurie ma che la cina venisse premiata in questa maniera spropositata non ce laspettavamo abbiamo lavorato quattro anni cos e vederci sottrarre il podio in questa maniera lascia molto amarezza

7237570 the commission on reflection agrees it was a hasty decision on complicated issues we have not had adequate briefing on
7237571 as the assembly reprehensive and council chair for the area we would like to invite the two of you to make a few remarks during the event
7237572 if theyre not able to do surgery to finish the repair the option is to leave him in traction and hed have to deal with however the bones heal
7237573 the most kindhearted helpful giving person i can think of
7237574 a mini tornado things just keep flying up in our faces
7237575 my mantra is i can get through this but when we get back to palmer your phone will be ringing
7237576 realistically it reveals that our city cannot support the quality of life that we would like on our one legged revenue stool so we have to look to donations
7237577 but when we are talking such huge amounts of money with the expectation that something is going to be given in return somehow that just doesnt sit right with me
7237578 realistically its really hard to balance paying for something like a stadium with just taxpayer dollars or state dollars
7237579 we go to the community and to corporate partners and frankly they want to be a part of the community but have a duty to get their name out there
7237580 the difference that i see is that as donors we take pride in that we helped build the park without a monetary return as part of the deal
7237581 naming things for conoco phillips or other commercial entities is done as a marketing event with the ulterior motive to increase profits

7237611 is curfew a solution to the problem i think no the centre should rather start looking for ways and means to bring the separatist leaders to the discussion table rather than having the ostrich like attitude that everything will be fine once the storm is over
7237612 all i can say is that talks were always a better option rather than having knee jerk reactions from the centre
7237613 if talks can be initiated in jammu region to bring peace then i believe the same yardstick should be applied to in kashmir why was the all party meeting that visited kashmir valley not so keen on meeting the fruit growers of the state
7237614 why were fruit growers kept waiting for hours outside the venue before they decided to boycott it

7237644 its really going to be up to parents to say not in my home

7237646 what is happening here something is definitely wrong here and if we dont find a way to fix it were going to keep burying our babies
7237647 its gotten ridiculous that we will not tell people about these murderers and rapists running around because were afraid of being labeled snitches

7237655 our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of h9n2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans
7237656 although no aerosol transmission was observed the virus replicated in multiple respiratory tissues and induced clinical signs similar to those observed with the human h3n2 virus

7237658 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7237659 i didnt expect it to be as lethal as it was
7237660 for me it raises even more concern than i already had about the pending potential of a flu pandemic
7237661 it looks as though an avian strain evolved in 1918 and that led to the deadly outbreak in much the same way as were now seeing the asian avian flu strains evolve
7237662 assuming this is a replicant of the 1918 flu strain if it got out it could initiate disease in humans and given the work theyve done one had to say it would be infectious
7237663 if the genetic sequence is out there on a database then that is a clear security risk

7237674 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7237675 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7237676 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7237677 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7237678 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7237679 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7237680 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7237681 but they are very skilled at obtaining money and using criminal systems to do it they can collect thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in a few weeks it is beyond our control

7237683 a high proportion of those children are home schooled in illinois pretty much all of the new cases of measles were among home schooled children and none of them were vaccinated

7237685 i have confronted death and defied it several times in the past
7237686 he was in a good mood very relaxed with no official duties he was completely different

7237690 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7237691 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7237692 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7237693 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7237694 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7237695 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7237696 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7237697 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
7237698 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7237699 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
7237700 sich stellen ist das schwierige macht aber das leben spannend
7237701 the viaduct remains closed and the exclusion zone remains in place as planned to allow safety checks to continue
7237702 we need to get the m1 opened as soon as possible
7237703 we have a bank holiday where people will be moving around the country coming back home going to see relatives or going to see places
7237704 they would require a very very significant investment and fundamentally speaking we are an energy company and our job is to keep peoples lights on
7237705 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7237706 we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours
7237707 we will reopen the road only when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so
7237708 you see very few cooling towers that are in quite such a visible position theyre 12 metres from the m1 and they kind of symbolise not only a gateway to sheffield and yorkshire but they also symbolise a gateway to the north
7237709 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7237710 a limited edition promotional item that is only available in europe asia and latin america while supplies last
7237711 that leads to complacency and making mistakes what i like to have is the confidence that i will get to the start line best prepared best trained and best coached without any last minute worries it then becomes exciting because it is your moment to shine your reward for all the hard work you and all the back up staff have put in i love the training the satisfaction at the end of a hard session that i have taken one small step to an overall goal you have to have motivation and there can be no greater motivation for me than to get gold in london
7237712 i have had so many messages and things to do that it hasnt sunk in yet but i am really looking forward to getting home to mansfield no doubt it will be crazy for a few days but i am so looking forward to seeing all my family and my boyfriend and taking the holiday that we have planned from day one i wont be back into the pool until september
7237713 this is the best british team i have seen by a long way and it is just getting better and better because we have done amazing things people are taking more interest and that should get us more support and better facilities to make london 2012 the best experience of all
7237714 its never easy getting up at five in the morning but it is just something you have to do to achieve what i have swimming for two hours doing some gym or something in the day and then another two hours in the evening is the programme i have done with bill furness and when i get back i am not planning to change anything

7237721 what can i say he is my friend and apart from that he is a great professional a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now hes experienced and he is only 26
7237722 this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for arsenal
7237723 when you see football all around the world you see very few teams who play the way that we play
7237724 i just enjoy it i feel it is my home now
7237725 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7237726 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7237727 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7237728 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7237729 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7237730 you stick him up there with chad barrett and half those chances go in the back of the net
7237731 in l a he kind of just lost his way
7237732 it was a great touch and a top class finish
7237733 more than just a point is the way we came back
7237734 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort
7237735 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada
7237736 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7237737 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see there has been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term
7237738 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7237739 we asked the international gymnastics federation to open up an inquiry themselves
7237740 eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7237741 it seems to be okay however they want to examine this thoroughly they will report to us as soon as possible
7237742 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7237743 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7237744 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7237745 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7237746 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7237747 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7237748 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7237749 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7237750 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7237751 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7237752 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7237753 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7237754 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7237755 we have some marvellous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7237756 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7237757 there is an urgent need to develop a radio news agency for wales as an alternative to the irn service which does not generally report wales specific stories
7237758 were quietly working on the hits and doing a lot of work on that
7237759 ive been listening to it and trying to find out who are the listeners i think theres room for that station its just how we do it
7237760 theres definitely some issues in terms of transmission and id really like to see where we go now
7237761 to offer consumers more choice and flexibility in how they purchase channels
7237762 i dont think there will be any downside for consumers
7237763 consumers who may have been interested in the prospect of satellite radio but were put off with the lack of alternative pricing plans
7237764 the satellite radio industry has a history of promising things and then letting it go by the wayside
7237765 is good news for strategic planners in the automotive business that have spent the last 18 months on hold pending this merger
7237766 alle haben gesehen was f r ein gro artiger fu baller er ist
7237767 er hat gl nzend reagiert ich hatte eigentlich alles richtig gemacht
7237768 ich habe ja seit mai kein spiel mehr bestritten da wurden die beine mit zunehmender spieldauer schon etwas schwer
7237769 das ging schon ganz gut obwohl ich erst einmal mit der kompletten mannschaft trainiert habe
7237770 das war rgerlich nach einem spiel mit dem ich durchaus zufrieden war wir haben uns selbst um den lohn unserer arbeit gebracht
7237771 viele gute dinge gesehen die gezeigt haben wo wir hinwollen
7237772 nach dem r ckstand sind wir zur ckgekommen und haben verdient den ausgleich geschafft das gibt selbstvertrauen
7237773 uns fehlt ein bisschen kreativit t nach dem weggang von rafael van der vaart es ist ein neuer hsv daran m ssen wir jetzt arbeiten
7237774 wir haben nicht den ausreichend qualitativ besetzten kader den wir uns w nschen
7237775 das ist normal bei neuen leuten der ball lief sehr langsam
7237776 wir haben das gl ck des t chtigen gehabt wir haben daf r gearbeitet
7237777 sch n wenn man mit dem k pfchen beim entscheidenden tor dabei war
7237778 das war brutal f r die mannschaft bitterer als das 0 7 letzte saison
7237779 i think the audience was a bit quiet there was no drive from the crowd
7237780 it should have been more of a stand out performance seeing as it was her first night
7237781 i expected her to say thank you to us considering we came along for the opening night her singing was good but there was no interaction
7237782 madonna was absolutely fantastic but the cardiff crowd completely let her down we enjoyed it to the max though and madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7237783 i think the fans who have been grumbling about the show are the older ones who arent as keen to get into the new songs
7237784 i paid 250 to get into the golden circle without having to queue but it was well worth it
7237785 i violently disagree with this almost pathological preoccupation with education
7237786 the customer who conserves isnt being given the proper message that youre doing a good job
7237787 because it doesnt have much of an impact on what theyre charged the signals are so horribly upside down in the way we charge for water in this county
7237788 now he has to earn his position like everyone else

7237790 all our focus is to make devotees dance and sing on krishnas birthday the day started with panchamrit abhishekam bathing the idol of krishna in milk curd ganga water honey and ghee
7237791 due to security reasons devotees were not allowed to carry liquids or the traditional offering of coconuts to the birla temple they were only allowed to offer sweets fruits and flowers to the lord the visitors had to go through security checks to enter the iskcon temple
7237792 dropping athavale from the show is not an issue this was an issue between the channel and athavale besides how can people who are involved in politics and social work participate in such a show people taking part in the show dont have any contact with the outside world for over 50 days how can a politician afford to stay out of touch with for so long
7237793 it caters to a certain class where does a politician fit into it
7237794 we think it he was left out because of his caste besides politicians like him can discuss about social issues constitution and about babasaheb ambedkar he would have enlightened them on various issues
7237795 they the suppliers suddenly called and said that only half of my months requirement would be fulfilled oil companies have not given anything in writing so its difficult to take any action
7237796 there are petrol dealers who are getting full quantity but few who have no contacts in the upper levels have to suffer from fuel shortage
7237797 oil companies are doing this to recover their money without giving any public notice although the information has not come officially we will restrict our services if its put down on paper but fuel availability outside mumbai is worse
7237798 currently there is no panic situation in mumbai but things could get worse
7237799 we have to restrict the customers requirement if customer needs 20 litres we may be forced to give them only 10 litre
7237800 this is holding motorcar owners to ransom the oil companies are indirectly pressuring the government to increase the fuel rate international oil prices have gone down so they cannot ask directly to increase the price
7237801 i had to change my body language from a woman to a man in a split second so the mind had to be alert and sharp
7237802 it was bizarre because its me as a man and a woman just by turning around
7237803 aamir has the capacity to surprise working with him is like driving a mercedes or bmw over any other car
7237804 but he captures the attitude and essence in such a correct manner that its never undignified it doesnt look as if hes mocking women just playing them
7237805 we chose a punjabi couple because they are usually outspoken their excitement is wider and they are so colourful i knew aamir would play it best
7237806 we cannot turn a blind eye to the threats around us we have to learn to protect our e assets ourselves so as a housing society we would like to be the first building in india to have our entire wireless network secured we hope other housing societies follow suit
7237807 since we install wi fi networks its only right that we takes measures to secure them as well why expect the government or the police to secure them for us its our problem and we need to find a solution
7237808 though the idea sounds interesting it does not seem to have a long term feasibility impact
7237809 i am absolutely not going to withdraw my statements behind the clamour for an apology lies the unstated demand that muslims who are successful must shut up and be grateful for what they have did anyone ever ask men to apologise for gender biased statements or the elite for their discrimination against the poor oh for the joy of being a muslim even if naam ke vaaste during these times
7237810 of course discrimination exists in india against all kinds of minorities look at what weve done to the dalits what about women look at the rampant female foeticide in the country but instead of despairing about this we should be rejoicing because theres a robust resistance from civil society against discrimination thats where we draw our strength from and not by pretending discrimination doesnt exist in spite of the prejudices we still have a mayawati and other women becoming formidable politicians we have gay people ruling the fashion industry so we neednt despair
7237811 to say im ungrateful is simply not fair ive always said im proud of indian democracy shatrughan sinha is a very dear friend id urge him to catch the interview on the internet hed realise that i also said in the interview that the indian muslim is far safer than in other countries because he has a space in democracy he can aspire to become the president of india a shah rukh khan or an irfan pathan
7237812 im certain he has been misinformed i love him to death hes one of those rare people wholl do anything for a friend a month ago one of my staffers child in bihar was severely infected by jaundice shatrughan sinha got the childs entire treatment done in darbhanga he saved the childs life
7237813 i spoke about it now because i read saif ali khans interview with you two years ago it happened to me and i didnt bother we were denied property apparently because we were non vegetarians and because we were film folks there were non muslim meat eaters and filmwallahs in the same locality its routine for muslims to not get proper housing facility so i didnt make any fuss about it in fact zeenat aman called and raised a hue and cry about being denied property about muslims not getting accommodation
7237814 im quite surprised that people are surprised about muslims not getting accommodation twice we tried to buy some property in the juhu vile parle scheme

7237823 by what power or in whose name have you done this
7237824 rulers and elders of our people 9 are we being questioned today because weve done a good deed for a crippled man do you want to know how he was healed 10 let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of israel that he was healed by the powerful name of jesus christ the nazarene the man you crucified but whom god raised from the dead 11 for jesus is the one referred to in the scriptures where it says the stone that you builders rejected has now become the cornerstone 12 there is salvation in no one else god has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved
7237825 we cant deny that they have performed a miraculous sign and everybody in jerusalem knows about it 17 but to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further we must warn them not to speak to anyone in jesus name again
7237826 do you think god wants us to obey you rather than him 20 we cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard
7237827 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7237828 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7237829 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7237830 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7237831 the confusion arose out of regional differences in how moderation will work as there are different legal rules each region have to play by and at one point this looked like it may require the game to be independent in each region
7237832 youre my best friend youre my best friend with an effect
7237833 can we come and see you someone wants to meet you his name is datuk kamal amir hold on ill pass the phone to him
7237834 hello kamal amir here i would be most honoured if i can meet you can we have tea today
7237835 sure no problem what time you want to come here
7237836 i can be there in one hour is that too late
7237837 actually im almost finished but never mind i will wait for you
7237838 not sure must be someone important though zahid only mixes with important people
7237839 im sure you can tell me a lot about the altantuya murder which the newspapers are not reporting
7237840 ill just say the honorary consul of mongolia who wishes to remain anonymous
7237841 but i dont care i have told the mongolian government that i want to buy a piece of land there and move to mongolia i dont mind even giving up my malaysian citizenship and settle down in mongolia so i dont care what they want to do to me
7237842 it is not that im scared it is just that the court case is going on so it would be sub judice for me to talk about the issue plus as the mongolian consel i need to be professional and not simply talk
7237843 what seven or eight people you mean altantuya was not the only one murdered and dumped at that site
7237844 those two utk are assassins their job is to get rid of people and that murder site is the place where they get rid of the bodies by blowing them up
7237845 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence a free people ought to be constantly awake

7237847 the band start to show their quality with some great guitar work which i thought was extinct from many upcoming bands
7237848 has an ozzy osbourne motley crue hybrid feel with a wah wah section that i enjoyed tremendously
7237849 gives a more modern metal feel that sounds like they mix in some motorhead as well
7237850 goes all epic with a slow metallica like rock sound that you can see lighters held up all lit
7237851 which like the title track has a sing along chant that can be infectious
7237852 goes back to a slow number start but chucks a more heavy 80s metal sound with wails that zakk wylde would be jealous of
7237853 with a great main guitar riff and blends well with what is the heaviest track on the album
7237854 which is more of a parent friendly version of the title track i mean would they really want to be told what to do if they werent down with the rock

7237857 um i put the 1 and the 3 in the wrong places
7237858 hmm kids eatting with their parents getting that last free meal lol
7237859 given the situation in which we were behind by a goal and had a man sent off it was not easy for us
7237860 therefore it really is remarkable how my team played in the second half
7237861 of course we wanted to win but with 10 men we really deserved this point
7237862 he is not a risk he just wanted to prove his leadership qualities
7237863 there was no intention against hajnal i just did not see him
7237864 if i had intended it then i would have struck him differently
7237865 pending state and city approvals the seven 400 foot turbines could generate 17 megawatts of energy enough to power 5 000 homes
7237866 it would take 4 3 million gallons of oil per year to achieve this electric production with oil at more than 100 a barrel today the energy costs would be staggering
7237867 their worlds came together they whirled and twirled and danced with each other only to collide and flee from one another
7237868 the truth the use of confusion tactics allow the dumper to get away without necessarily making the dumpee feel like caterpillar poo lets take a look at a few confusion tactics from a males point of view i think that we should see other people
7237869 i love you i am just not in love with you
7237870 i have bad news the federal government just outlawed premarital relationships so it looks like we are going to have to stop seeing each other
7237871 i cannot f ing stand you every morning that i wake up next to you is a morning that my self respect declines and bring me that much closer to taking a skydiving trip through a helicopter field
7237872 ah yes divorce from the latin word meaning to rip out a mans genitals through his wallet
7237873 women complain about premenstrual syndrome but i think of it as the only time of the month that i can be myself
7237874 women need a reason to have sex men just need a place
7237875 according to a new survey women say they feel more comfortable undressing in front of men than they do undressing in front of other women they say that women are too judgmental where of course men are just grateful
7237876 theres a new medical crisis doctors are reporting that many men are having allergic reactions to latex condoms they say they cause severe swelling so whats the problem
7237877 theres very little advice in mens magazines because men think i know what im doing just show me somebody naked
7237878 instead of getting married again im going to find a woman i dont like and just give her a house
7237879 see the problem is that god gives men a brain and a penis and only enough blood to run one at a time
7237880 women might be able to fake orgasms but men can fake whole relationships
7237881 my girlfriend always laughs during sex no matter what shes reading

7237886 your husband is suffering from a very severe disease combined with horrible stress if you dont do the following your husband will surely die
7237887 each morning fix him a healthy breakfast be pleasant and make sure he is in a good mood for lunch make him a nutritious meal for dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him dont burden him with chores as he probably had a hard day dont discuss your problems with him it will only make his stress worse and most importantly make love with your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim if you can do this for the next 10 months to a year i think your husband will regain his health completely
7237888 if i had known what you were doing i would have given you all of my business
7237889 due to the fact that heaven is now overcrowded therefore st peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering heaven if anyone of you can ask me a question which i dont know or cannot answer then youre worthy enough to go to heaven if not then youll come with me to hell

7237899 look here youre the only white man weve ever seen and this woman gives birth to a white child it doesnt take a genius to figure out what happened
7237900 no chief youre mistaken what you have here is a natural occurrence what we in the civilized world call an albino look at that field over there all of the sheep are white except for one black one nature does this on occasion
7237901 tell you what you dont say anything more about that sheep and i wont say anything more about that white child
7237902 because white is the color of happiness and today is the happiest day of her life
7237903 i spent the money so i could look pretty for you because i love you so much
7237904 i bought these gifts for you with the money because i love you so much

7237911 i got my period today honey we can explore out intellectual side tonight instead of just having sex like everybody else

7237913 i got my period today honey we can go out and so something fun we havent been doing that recently ill pay
7237914 im totally grossed out your cue to tell me im beautiful
7237915 dont mind me ill just sit here and hate myself and drown in blood and be in pain for a whole week
7237916 oh yeah i got it today forgot to tell you sorry about the mess
7237917 naaah its ok we dont have to have sex tonight im tired too
7237918 fantastisk dejlig sofa der lige tr nger til en k rlig h nd hist og her men som har tilh rt en grandonkel til din mosters svigermors 10 gtef lle og derfor er pissesp ndende rent historisk
7237919 the situation in the league table is pretty but we are clever enough and not so naive to think that this will be a permanent reflection of the reality
7237920 we did not play as well in the first half as we actually can do
7237921 but it all came together in the second half and we forced errors and created lots of chances
7237922 we are just looking from one game to the next
7237923 we all know wooball gm kevin koda played with aj francisco in game bang and you know those two are in contact
7237924 dont be surprised if koda told da guh tips on how to beat smb
7237925 scoring title is nice but when you have your own team it feels a lot better
7237926 they have lost these close games because theyre a rookie team once they figure it out theyll be on the opposite end of those heartbreaking losses
7237927 he plays fearless against us he took the final shot but came up short despite the miss hes definitely looking like an all star
7237928 nusantara employs a basic 2 3 defense but their guards are so quick and can cover a lot of ground daimon anchors the team in the middle so if anyone gets by their guards they would have to go through him
7237929 that role should have been for our cousin who shot lights out for espana against team usa last night unfortunately he had commitments to play for his country so we couldnt add him to our roster
7237930 so what we are going to do is ask about lli and what they did to beat evil empire last week
7237931 we dont want to make the same mistake they did so well make adjustments and hopefully gut this out
7237932 no rest for lli means untouchables should be there early trying to scout them
7237933 i still dont know how we lost to kellz we had them
7237934 maybe its cuz i was looking forward to my vegas trip since im turning 30
7237935 team kellz is looking for high percentage shots and theyre sharing the ball more than ever
7237936 gone is that 1 on 1 dribbling from last season
7237937 game bang better not overlook assassins like the motto says every game matters especially in gold if they lose this game gb will essentially be out of the title hunt with a win theyll have momentum for their much anticipated matchup versus elements
7237938 sure its only lebronze but there are still some very competitive games being played neither of these teams want to lose no matter what division youre in you want to win a championship this should be a good game
7237939 james bernardo is irreplaceable he knows how to run the show for his elements squad but more importantly hes the leader anytime the leader is out its hard to replace that
7237940 altrettanto giusto aspettarci nel breve e nel lungo periodo conferme di un certo livello

7237948 too many riders are going out on these machines unlicensed uninsured and not wearing the correct safety gear

7237951 ach waarom ook niet een bak popcorn kan best voor een keer
7237952 does this represent an overall shift in strategy do they have to find a new path to 270 electoral votes does this represent a sign of things to come in other states is the obama campaign planning to close down offices in states they have initially targeted
7237953 this is a dream come true for me i have signed a four year deal with virtus bologna which includes a pretty good buy out to nba that we were able to negogiate salary is as good as it wouldve been in the nba

7237959 their sacrifice is a testament to what it means to love your country and love your countrymen
7237960 to make sure they understand freedom comes with an awful price
7237961 when you were born you were handed the most important gift in the world
7237962 to talk about old times its something you cant do with your friends back home
7237963 i love fashion and i hope to go into the fashion industry someday
7237964 someone in california pulled the credit report on our loan application which is a public record
7237965 it could be someone hacking into a computer from outside the office
7237966 but a lot of it is because employees take home information stored on laptop computers not realizing how vulnerable that information is
7237967 sometimes i feel like a prophet like noah saying we need to build a boat because the waters coming
7237968 because of the passion we have to fight back we concentrate on helping individuals and company owners to secure their businesses and educate their employees
7237969 but our focus is about every consumer in the valley
7237970 they think they are under the radar of identity thieves and thats why its called the silent crime
7237971 right now i dont believe he is the presidency does not lend itself to on the job training
7237972 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7237973 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7237974 theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one ive ever seen
7237975 the only question is will voters see that and will it calm those who are questioning obamas foreign policy experience

7237986 nei laboratori incontri di scrittura creativa fatti con i ragazzi dalle elementari alla superiori dice ancora lo scrittore antonio trillicoso vengono fuori delle realt espressive bellissime il pi delle volte sconosciute ai ragazzi stessi ai genitori e agli insegnanti ed bello tutto questo un tentativo per far appropriare i ragazzi di forze espressive interiori e metterle in campo per il grande gioco della vita
7237987 il mio tentativo sottolinea trillicoso quello che attraverso le miei produzioni i ragazzi sviluppino un senso critico verso le cose landare oltre le apparenze quello che si vede quello che si sente non accettare tutto perch stato detto o stato scritto i miei libri nascono dalle discussioni con i ragazzi e dalle loro interazioni riflessioni su un argomento al di l di come appare o ce lo vogliono far apparire
7237988 tutti dobbiamo sforzarci di creare opportunit per far venir fuori la fantasia che nascosta in ogni bambino perch li porter alla libert di pensiero e ad affermare quella forza interiore che li porter a non aver paura di mostrare e di far conoscere le loro idee questo vale anche per i grandi

7237991 quando un lavoro ben fatto non teme confronti hanno esordito allunisono de angelis e verde il progetto presentato dalla scuola di cesa risultato tra i primi ad essere finanziato per la sua validit educativa un riconoscimento meritato per una direzione didattica che dallo scorso anno con larrivo del nuovo dirigente scolastico rinata e ha fatto cose meravigliose anche grazie a scuole aperte oggi bisogna consolidare lottimo lavoro fin qui prodotto ma confidiamo nella grande professionalit e competenza mostrata dal dirigente scolastico siamo orgogliosi del lavoro condotto dalla dottoressa mincione e dallintero corpo docente e non docente il neo dirigente hanno chiosato stato in grado di dare un impronta innovativa riuscendo in poco tempo ad aprire la scuola al territorio coinvolgendo e rendendo partecipi del processo educativo famiglie associazioni e istituzioni
7237992 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
7237993 save me from myself how i found god quit korn kicked drugs and lived to tell my story
7237994 right now weve got an in store record store tour
7237995 id say both in the beginning i was stressed out but i was having fun i was goin through challenges ya know when you do methamphetamine it messes with your emotions and mind and stuff partying for that many years its like a kid goin to the candy store every day sooner or later hes gonna end up sick and unhealthy ya know after time passes you start to become more normal again but i had a lot of fits or rage i would break things in the studio if things didnt go my way so that had to go but the times when things were goin really good were fun while i was going through those challenges i could take time off i would take like even six months off ya know in 2006 i hadnt done music for a while and just wanted to take a break it was cool to do that because there was no pressure there was no one tellin me dude you gotta get into the studio and finish this weve got a deadline there was no deadline it was just whatever happened ya know everything happened the way it was supposed to because im a new man now im totally calm when things dont do my way i dont freak out im just a new person and it feels great

7238092 the use of eye catching news erotic photos or new movies videos to spread malware is known as social engineering
7238093 the large number of false news stories in circulation over the last few days seems to indicate a large scale orchestrated attack to infect a large number of users by taking advantage of the good reputation of these services however it can also serve to cover up other more silent but equally dangerous attacks
7238094 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed

7238097 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
7238098 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
7238099 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
7238100 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good

7238110 id rather have jill on mondays and tuesdays than the rest of the qa team put together
7238111 everyone has to do a stint in qa for a while before moving on to code
7238112 i didnt follow any pre scripted test cases and i didnt really follow the regular testing process
7238113 we already do code inspections michael fagan invented inspections in 1976 and his company is teaching us how to do it
7238114 we believe by the end of the year we can get it up to 7
7238115 the problem is we cant inspect more than that given the number of hours it takes to complete a fagan inspection we dont have the time to inspect more than 7 of the new code we write
7238116 what are you going to do about the other 93
7238117 it has been frustrating we almost hit the target but you dont get medals for close
7238118 but weve got some fantastic young athletes and theres real promise for 2012 its just going to take time
7238119 weve got the athletes and its just a case of making sure no stone is left unturned and everything is catered for in terms of their preparation thats the difference between fourth and getting on the podium
7238120 and once you get the winning habit it starts to roll
7238121 weve seen that with other sports and we are maybe one year away from it
7238122 the mens 4x100m relay was a real frustration to everyone involved

7238124 there were four people in one lane and we couldnt pass the baton because they were in the way
7238125 it was frustrating and we protested but they were never going to re run the final
7238126 but the team has worked well its just frustrating at this games that we couldnt put the icing on the cake and win a few more medals
7238127 that is the kind of investment it takes at this level im not sure how many weeks pay that is for a centre forward or drinks bills for football club directors but it is certainly not a disproportionate amount of money
7238128 it was immensely frustrating to everyone in the programme who has worked so professionally but this was not down to under practice
7238129 this is the first time the mens team have put the baton down they have won medals at every major championship except this one and that is a frustration

7238196 getting into a car with anything to drink is wrong dangerous and unacceptable
7238197 im 19 but no matter how old you are you should take responsibility for your actions which i will do
7238198 i think the law was not universally applauded so i think school systems have not with the exception of baltimore city been particularly proponents
7238199 charters are out there to provide innovations and sometimes traditional public schools are not the answer for every child
7238200 some of them have done extremely well and some are struggling

7238202 my parents have always said they would be a little upset if we didnt feel something when we get rid of them

7238209 communities throughout the state need to do more of this
7238210 there is a lot of interest here in finding a job
7238211 the idea is to get people here with the giveaway and let them leave with hope
7238212 our pastor told us it is time to go outside the walls of the church
7238213 we are giving away resources as well and services for the whole person no one else was doing that here and we decided to no matter what the cost
7238214 edmondson village was once a thriving economic area and we want to recapture that

7238218 i bought the tape some years ago of wartime radio broadcasts from radio yesteryear and nowhere on the liner notes does it mention kate smith singing in baltimore
7238219 of course i grew up in the war years and every time smith sung god bless america it gave me goose bumps especially when she hits those high notes it still does
7238220 during the broadcast she honors a young war widow from baltimore and every time i listen to it i wonder if she could possibly still be alive
7238221 the singer wearing a fur coat and orchids was greeted loudly by the men many of whom were seated high on cranes and construction frames overlooking the officials stand
7238222 in each is the purpose the will to achieve the will of the men and women of america to take steel and wood and paint and assemble them into a ship for our country
7238223 usually at this point we salute a hero of battle tonight our spotlight turns on a young woman whose name belongs beside those heroes on our roll of honor
7238224 here beside me is pretty brown haired jacqueline gloria precht a war widow at the age of 19 who works proudly as a solderer in the radio division of bendix aviation here in baltimore maryland
7238225 this young girl was stunned when the navy announced last november the death of her husband a naval gunner in the merchant marine six other members of her family are now in war production work and jacqueline sought war work immediately after hearing that her husband had been killed in action
7238226 she has become a valuable contributor to victory and america is proud of jacqueline precht
7238227 we salute her now we offer her our thanks and as a memento of the occasion we offer a dozen roses the symbol of our spotlight for workers fighters and marchers to victory

7238247 over the past four years weve seen the gradual emergence of energy efficiency as an issue for data centre managers in the region but only this year did the issue break into the top five areas of concern in a big way
7238248 interestingly the survey also shows us that power densities in asia are following closely those found today in the u s where in the past american trends were not seen as a benchmark for asia we can now draw much closer parallels between the regions which has planning implications for all of us in addressing the issue at a regional scale
7238249 this response is symptomatic of an audience that has been barraged by conflicting information from the main industry players
7238250 this was the single most important problem we set out to rectify with the energy logic symposiums because confusion leads to inaction by bringing industry leaders and decision makers together weve sought to find a cohesive understanding of the issues and identify appropriate solutions
7238251 the best way to ensure energy efficiency is through a holistic approach that includes it equipment efficiencies best practice data centre design and efficient power and cooling infrastructure
7238252 energy logic is the first practical framework that can be used to measurably reduce energy costs by applying 10 technologies and best practices that have the greatest impact on energy efficiency in the data centre
7238253 adaptivexchange will take the concepts introduced by energy logic and transform them into practical actionable solutions that can immediately be implemented in computer rooms and data centres
7238254 the event represents a major forum for data centre professionals from around the region and through the user group and survey will be used to develop and share practical energy efficiency strategies on a regional scale i encourage anyone who has even a passing interest in energy efficiency to register today

7238294 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner the misano circuit is quite fast but it feels tight and narrow the grip level is okay last year we used medium compound tyres because it was quite hot the track was also very bumpy last year which was probably its worst feature from a set up point of view the most important thing at misano is having good braking power and good stability when accelerating out of the corners its the kind of track that requires you to ride aggressively my favourite section is the final part though the most important section for good lap times is the first the atmosphere is great and it can get quite intense you get a lot of valentino rossi fans there because his hometown is nearby

7238352 i want to show the strength of the uyoku power
7238353 on the anniversary the uyoku begin working from early in the morning
7238354 not only around yasukuni but all throughout tokyo they blast their messages from speakers mounted atop their trucks this is the most appropriate day of the year for them to appeal their existence to the public the police cannot control them and we cannot let them continue with these harsh activities we have to do something
7238355 it seems like the police are trying to stop them but in reality it is very easy for the uyoku to break through
7238356 we cant rely on the police and the uyoku know that we have the skills and power to fight back so that is why they dont attack so aggressively
7238357 china and south korea educate their children to hate japan they dont want the younger generation to stop being angry and want to continue receiving money from the japanese government

7238360 we are completely against all the people who go to yasukuni
7238361 we are not going to forgive the government at all no more war no more yasukuni
7238362 we have guts and pride and i am sure they will be coming after us
7238363 im alright a little hungry and a little cold though
7238364 dont worry you can have this i wasnt that hungry anyway
7238365 d do you think the others while come back for us
7238366 i dont know but we have to think about ourselves for now were running low on food and supplies another day or two and well be completely out of food and water
7238367 the fires dimming im stirring the coals around to keep it going
7238368 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
7238369 this is why i didnt want to be found out
7238370 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
7238371 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
7238372 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age
7238373 i first discovered my ability to change when we were trying to escape from tv tokyo
7238374 hey sweetie your father and i will be working pretty late tonight so i prepared your favorite dish spaghetti and meatballs youll just have to warm it in the microwave oven for a few minutes and take it out be careful not to burn yourself on the plate o well probably be home around 1 00 a m or later dont stay up too late and be sure to get up early to make it to your c ute haha little group tomorrow morning love mom
7238375 come on mom im not a little kid anymore its like youre writing to a little child

7238377 i was at work and overheard something on the radio go to our room and turn on the tv right now
7238378 i just picked up your mother and were on our way home right now
7238379 maimi honey listen to mommy were on our way right now hang in there
7238380 honey you have to listen to me you have to run you have to get away from the house and get to your friends
7238381 yes sweetie you have to get back to your friends no matter what
7238382 nothing sweetie now listen up open the top drawer of our dresser and look for a white envelope inside the white envelope is over 100 000 yen i want you to take it and run as far away from tokyo as you can
7238383 no sweetie you have to go on without us at this rate we cant make it to you
7238384 i know you are were all scared but you have to do this we know you can
7238385 run maimi run and dont look back dont come back for anything save yourself
7238386 maimi you have to save yourself i know you can do it weve seen how much youve grown up and matured far beyond your years

7238388 uh yeah im fine just took a spill thats all
7238389 i mean yeah bro just lost control of my horse for a second nothing to worry about
7238390 and thats how i first discovered my ability to morph into other people
7238391 i see so how why not tell any of us even when you already know that were also mutants
7238392 well i saw it as an advantage i could change into someone older and not have to worry about anyone treating me like a scared little kid
7238393 with all youve been through i think youve proven that you can take care of yourself if you need to
7238394 so how far do your powers go can you only copy peoples appearance
7238395 no ive copied other s m a t girls appearances and found i could also mimic some of their powers but theyre much weaker in comparison
7238396 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
7238397 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
7238398 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
7238399 this is why i didnt want to be found out
7238400 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
7238401 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
7238402 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age

7238503 becky was a longtime friend and i never knew she sang until she got up and sang at another cancer event
7238504 so she sang in our band for four years before she passed away she was a great gal to have in the band i appreciate all the volunteers musicians and bands here today it took a lot of work by a lot of people and its great that people are willing to do that
7238505 everyone is touched by cancer somehow its nice to have big hearted volunteers with a passion to help other people weve been fortunate weve done so well we usually bring in around 30 000 we added the car show cruise in for a cure this year it looks like that will be a big success and we want to make that an annual thing

7238556 if the tax records are wrong the village should have to pay all of us who live here and have paid taxes on their property
7238557 now they are saying we are preventing them from using public land
7238558 everything about it is in common pleas court its public record and thats all i can say
7238559 i was told basically if i was on my porch it would be trespassing
7238560 but if this porch is on their property shouldnt they have to pay to keep it up it needs new carpet
7238561 its been going on for a year its just so frustrating
7238562 but i think they the village should settle the land problem first before the garage problem

7238564 i told our kids earlier in the week our goal was to bring him back the game ball from the victory
7238565 he was on our minds throughout the game and all week even during timeouts and breaks during the game it was 1 2 3 coach t i heard kids yelling out throughout the game keep fighting for coach t
7238566 we talked as a coaching staff and we realized he wasnt much longer for this world
7238567 but we said he would probably hang on for the newark game he may not have been there but his spirit was its like it let go afterwards
7238568 hes irreplaceable as blue devil legend he had a lot of passion in everything he did if we only had more people like that in society we would all be better people
7238569 john parsons bob drobney jim mccandlish kenny krause and now donis it seems like all ive done this year is go to hospitals and funerals somehow im still hanging on
7238570 donis was a teammate a fellow coach and a great friend
7238571 the thing about donis he had a lot of pride he was proud of his family and proud of his performance as a player and a coach and he was very proud of his players he was proud of his accomplishments
7238572 but as big and boisterous as he was he was a pussycat on the inside
7238573 the black community used to call us ebony and ivory because we were together so much we saw each other more than our wives he always used to say that he made me what i was and i used to say that i made him people used to get a kick out of it
7238574 he was a class act all the way from his coaching to his officiating and just as a friend in general
7238575 its a great loss for zanesville high school he was a major influence on every young man who went through that school whether they were an athlete or not
7238576 he had a voice and charisma that got your attention
7238577 i remember going into his office to talk about the lineup
7238578 it was pretty dramatic for me at the time i was scared to death well he moved me down to third and we won the col the next day
7238579 i definitely respected the man and enjoyed playing for him he took me under his wing and ill always appreciate that
7238580 he made a lot of yound men grow up he taught a lot of life lessons
7238581 he really cared about the kids and he just made you feel special you wanted to play for him you wanted to give your all for that guy he touched so many lives he was a great man who was respected by so many people

7238585 we actually pushed him in the spring and he responded to that challenge his leadership has been great we had our first seven on seven drills the other day and chad was out there leading the drills hes matured a ton in the past three years
7238586 this will be our third year in the spread offense and we will have a third year quarterback cates running the spread for us
7238587 were a little more athletic than we have been in the past few years
7238588 weve played a lot of 10th graders and 11th graders who have matured and have experience
7238589 we will be bigger up front but we will be younger
7238590 we have the most talent on this team since the last time we made the playoffs
7238591 hopefully with the numbers being as good as they are no one will be playing full time both ways
7238592 our goal is to use our numbers to our advantage
7238593 the goal is to make the playoffs like everyone else
7238594 interesting but it wasnt a real hard transition kids are kids whether theyre 18 and 19 or 15 and 16
7238595 i dont know what to compare anything to so i cant really evaluate where we are according to everyone else in the league
7238596 all we can do is work our tails off and work them hard
7238597 the only chance we have is to buy into the system and work as hard as we can and go from there
7238598 i think theyre huge getting off to a good start and building some confidence i expect us to get better every game
7238599 i think you should always strive to win a conference championship
7238600 especially if youre in a situation where youve won i think thats just what you have to do
7238601 basically the way weve tried to approach it is in the conference itll be like being in a playoff game every week
7238602 you realize when you have an injury like that how much the spread depends on one guy
7238603 other than the 1998 team i had at gosling this is the best team ive ever had
7238604 our goal every year is to win a state championship
7238605 but were just an average team that plays hard aint no way id pick us
7238606 youll never see me walking on the field thinking we cant win

7238610 its the best position for us to be in and thats why we have so much confidence this year
7238611 we know that if we run it or pass it we have those guys up front who have been through the fire together
7238612 those are the smartest guys on the field for us
7238613 thats a huge advantage because they are so involved in our offense
7238614 i told jordan that he would be sick of me because hes going to be hearing a lot from me
7238615 but it has worked well because his confidence level is getting a lot better hes really doing well
7238616 if those three guys are having a good game were usually having a good game
7238617 theyre some of the hardest workers on the team and theyre also very fast we dont have the biggest linebacking group but we feel like were very quick which allows us to play an attacking style of defense
7238618 demetris is going to be an athlete to watch for the next two years
7238619 when hes out there we feel like we have another linebacker on the field he has a great knack for finding the football on the field
7238620 hell start on defense but when we need to throw well put him in
7238621 theyre all older and were going to have a good line again next year
7238622 we probably have one of the toughest conferences in the state
7238623 leadership dedication and work ethic are a few words that come to mind
7238624 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7238625 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7238626 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7238627 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7238628 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day

7238631 no i just want to win you dont understand i havent won anything i can sit up here all night

7238635 i like throwing the ball more than running i like giving the ball to one of my teammates and letting them make a play
7238636 of course im going to be a senior so there are always leadership roles you have to take but i like being a leader
7238637 i knew my junior year would be my year i really enjoyed it
7238638 i want to play where ill help the team the most
7238639 hes a great student does very well academically aside from being a very good athlete and being blessed with a lot of talent when you put intelligence and athletic ability and you throw into the mix the competitive nature of matt it attracts others to follow you people are just attracted to him
7238640 there was a common thread there that his teachers really appreciated that matthew was such a good student and was so respectful of them he also always seemed to be a little mature for his age
7238641 when he brings home an award we find it in his room
7238642 ha cant run on dirt eh cant go a mile and a quarter
7238643 theres not a lot of time to build up so we might have to be creative how we build him up were not exactly sure how were going to do it
7238644 wait a minute this isnt true i can see it isnt true
7238645 all history is about which groups have power over which other groups
7238646 i wanted the institute to become known perhaps famous due to its contributions to marxism
7238647 by clearly stating his personal allegiance to marxism as a scientific methodology
7238648 hey this isnt us and were not going to bless this
7238649 if it can be said that in the early years of its history the institute concerned itself primarily with an analysis of bourgeois societys socio economic sub structure
7238650 in the years after 1930 its primary interests lay in its cultural superstructure indeed the traditional marxist formula regarding the relationship between the two was brought into question by critical theory
7238651 materialism as far back as hobbes had led to a manipulative dominating attitude toward nature
7238652 was to become a central concern of the frankfurt school in subsequent years
7238653 horkheimers antagonism to the fetishization of labor heres were theyre obviously departing from marxist orthodoxy expressed another dimension of his materialism the demand for human sensual happiness
7238654 discussed the hostility to personal gratification inherent in bourgeois culture
7238655 protest against asceticism in the name of a higher morality
7238656 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined
7238657 we should find out first how big the fire is and how soon it will be extinguished in order to assess the damage
7238658 to bardzo prawdziwe to by a bardzo kosztowna konferencja prasowa
7238659 i wouldnt say it was easy but in the end the bout turned out the way i expected
7238660 he is a dangerous giant but i badly wanted to win
7238661 ill keep on going in the olympic or amateur level and compete for my police club and try to defend my world championship in milan my home city
7238662 then perhaps i will retire because i will be at that age
7238663 after the first round it was clear who would win i never feared my athlete could lose this final
7238664 all i can say is my opponent was doing an excellent job
7238665 i was a little nervous in my home country and there was a lot of pressure i did not do as good a job as i should have done
7238666 compared to four years ago i became a different boxer and i improved
7238667 my first two matches here were hard fights and the third and fourth i won based on technical skills i can adapt myself to my opponents but i perform best when it is a technical fight

7238673 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7238674 i hope the atmosphere on the mall and across the entire uk will be electric
7238675 i look forward to coming back here and swimming four years from now
7238676 it takes human error and human judgment out of it as far as officials running the clock they say when the nfl did it they actually gained four to five plays per game
7238677 the committee is struggling with trying to maintain a reasonable length of the game
7238678 the changes put in a couple of years ago there was such a negative reaction to them we reverted to original rules but the committee felt like there was room to improve length of the game
7238679 the national commissioners for college officials they say with the old 25 second clock they gave their guys 13 14 seconds to start the clock
7238680 the reality is the 40 second clock should not change the tempo of the game unless you choose to change it
7238681 fabio is meant to lead but the only place weve gone so far is round in circles
7238682 it is time for the real capello to stand up and start dictating to the players and the public exactly what he wants then hell find people will get behind him
7238683 it means picking vibrant wide players rather than starting with when he cant get forward as he used to it means banging frank lampards heads together and getting them to play as a unit because they can
7238684 se va a tardar m s de lo que presumiblemente esper bamos

7238687 i wouldnt say it was easy but in the end the bout turned out the way i expected
7238688 he is a dangerous giant but i badly wanted to win
7238689 ill keep on going in the olympic or amateur level and compete for my police club and try to defend my world championship in milan my home city
7238690 then perhaps i will retire because i will be at that age
7238691 after the first round it was clear who would win i never feared my athlete could lose this final
7238692 all i can say is my opponent was doing an excellent job
7238693 i was a little nervous in my home country and there was a lot of pressure i did not do as good a job as i should have done
7238694 compared to four years ago i became a different boxer and i improved
7238695 my first two matches here were hard fights and the third and fourth i won based on technical skills i can adapt myself to my opponents but i perform best when it is a technical fight
7238696 what can i say he is my friend and apart from that he is a great professional a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now hes experienced and he is only 26
7238697 this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for arsenal
7238698 when you see football all around the world you see very few teams who play the way that we play
7238699 i just enjoy it i feel it is my home now

7238701 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
7238702 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
7238703 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
7238704 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
7238705 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser

7238711 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7238712 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7238713 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7238714 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7238715 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7238716 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7238717 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7238718 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7238719 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7238720 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7238721 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7238722 the strength and morale that our heroic troops will receive from this victory in their battles to finally end bloody terrorism from our country is immeasurable
7238723 he probably threw 140 or 150 pitches but they werent going to the bullpen so we had to beat him
7238724 in the sixth seventh and eighth we have that tendency sometimes it takes us until then to get in our groove
7238725 we didnt give up we came back and we had the chance

7238727 you would walk up to her and feel like she had known you all your life youd get caught up in her enthusiasm for life in general she had an aura about her she was almost angelic you wanted to be around her longer
7238728 whether you had money no money had a home were homeless she greeted everyone the same
7238729 everything she really knew about being christian and accepting jesus as savior she learned when she was a little girl from her grandmother
7238730 she was the one everyone came to if there was a problem or complaint
7238731 she felt she and dad were a team doing what the lord had called them to do
7238732 it was a cool car to have but its unfortunate how things happened at the end
7238733 its one of those deals when i couldnt get by him
7238734 i had to ask myself would he do it to me and he has before
7238735 i just kind ran into him in the back of my mind i was thinking about the nationwide race in richmond when he power drived me
7238736 edwards hit me in turn 1 and got me a little loose
7238737 carl will say he doesnt like to race like that but he does it anyway
7238738 we talk about rivalries but now we might have one

7238742 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7238743 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7238744 the reason for the exhortation that the philippines needs to focus is two fold firstly the country is not large enough to compete against india and china on the basis of scale and so the country needs carefully to select its battles
7238745 secondly focus brings the ability to charge premium rates for skills that are rarer this means the philippines can avoid being dragged into a low wage low investment spiral
7238746 however the key will be to ensure that the open source businesses that are created develop high value assets rather than developing as low value services businesses
7238747 there is a danger that too many areas of focus emerge in the philippine ict economy meaning that it will become difficult to gain the depth of skills required to develop globally competitive business that can sustain premium rates as opposed to the low rate economy associated with much outsourcing and bpo activity
7238748 for all of the outsourcing activities there are skill requirements for language it management and customer service and the various elements of the philippine education system need to respond positively here
7238749 however the more specialist skills and the sheer number of different specialist skills that will be needed are likely to be more difficult to produce without significant support and investment from government in secondary tertiary and vocational education
7238750 the regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope that they will continue
7238751 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china
7238752 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7238753 the just quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in proceeding
7238754 the better part of the national council meeting was dedicated to attacking us mps and tsvangirai but there is no way we can distance ourselves from our colleagues in the tsvangirai led formation it is surprising that our leaders now want to back zanu pf and president robert mugabe
7238755 mutambara is a man of the world having received his education outside of zimbabwe and working as a rocket scientist for nasa in the usa but the lure of political fame in zimbabwe proved too much and he was parachuted in as the leader of the smaller faction of the mdc following that partys split over the senate and i do believe that if he does ally himself with mugabe his faction will be absorbed into zanu pf and there will be nothing left bar an oily stain on the floor in a leading social network site face book leading civic organisations leaders have already started lobbying for mutambara to be included in the targeted sanctions list that will see him losing some of the investments he is alleged to be having in the west the youth umbrella body zimbabwe youth networks munjodzi mutandiri commenting to this journalist raised extreme concern over mutambara conduct over the past few days and said anyone who supported dictatorship needed to stomach a bitter pill trained professor an american green card holder who is in the process of attaining an american citizenship it is unbelievable what hypocrisy
7238756 if you are unsure of the path that this man has taken for himself and his faction take a little time to listen to the interview he gave on abc this week the interview itself is not long but it will leave a sour taste in many mouths as mutambara sounds very much like a young mugabe frothing at the mouth and lording it over all and sundry is not what zimbabweans wants or indeed expect this is a population that has been beaten to their knees by zanu pf over almost thirty years do they really need a similar figure to ally themselves with mugabe anyone who goes to bed with the dictator deserves an equal punishment that is being received by the dictator himself anyone who supports an arrangement that is blind to the victories of 29 march elections deserves to be treated the same way like the dictator
7238757 mutambara should be slammed with travel sanctions as he is helping the dictator to cling on power after losing the legitimate 29 march election to the mdc leader morgan richard tsvangirai
7238758 mugabe is rewarding the army chiefs who stood by him in his greatest hour of need after he suffered a humiliating defeat in the first round of voting on march 29
7238759 un prestigio social por estar con una persona m s joven
7238760 la necesidad de suplir carencias afectivas provenientes de una figura paterna ausente
7238761 ella busca la frescura y el dinamismo del joven su mayor facilidad para el afecto la presencia de ilusiones intactas en el amor y en la vida y el apogeo sexual y a veces una necesidad velada por parte de la mujer madura de dominar de no quedarse soltera y de ejercer de cuidadora abnegada
7238762 la estabilidad emocional la seguridad personal independencia la tolerancia y la comprensi n de la mujer adulta y en ocasiones la necesidad de delegar su vida en otra persona en que una figura maternal y tierna les dirija su vida

7238766 ser una persona atractiva y deseable no es una cuesti n de juventud sino de actitud
7238767 tal vez necesitamos m s referentes de mujeres sexualmente atractivas y deseables despu s de los sesenta puesto que de hombres ya abundan
7238768 cuando hablamos de placer y de deseo tenemos que olvidarnos del concepto cl sico y equivocado de rendimiento competitividad y resultados que muchas veces creemos que marca la diferencia entre disfrutar y no disfrutar
7238769 las relaciones sexuales agrega tienen como objetivo nico disfrutar sentir compartir estar a gusto y para ello la duraci n del coito o el n mero de orgasmos no es imprescindible
7238770 el rgano sexual m s grande del cuerpo es la piel y en la piel las diferencias de edad quedan en segundo plano

7238774 the studio has now been chosen and the majority of the votes landed on
7238775 we will head into the studio armed to the teeth with red wine on monday the 24th of november and finish off the ritual at winter solstice i believe this is just enough time to capture what we have in store this time around
7238776 id say that as far the material goes we are more than 80 done with the music or perhaps closer to 85 actually
7238777 some special guests will also appear this time but all will be revealed when the time is right

7238780 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
7238781 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep
7238782 we must first begin by asking permission from our babies to be massaged
7238783 asking our babies for consent is part of establishing bonds and creating the feeling of trust and security
7238784 the importance of touch to a baby is immeasurable infant massage is the transference of a moms positive energy to the baby the more a mother touches her infant the more she communicates love

7238789 we dont know what else to do wed like to reach out and hug them but we cant
7238790 this is our way of telling them that we love them and appreciate everything that theyve done for us and the sacrifice thats been made for us here in canada
7238791 its such a honour to be able to represent canada three times at the games
7238792 all three of them have been so special in their own way
7238793 so carrying the flag its just a great way to end these olympics
7238794 with the time constraint it was tough to be back and get ready and in shape for these games
7238795 after my event i was still in disbelief because its been such a hard year for me to come back from an injury
7238796 i didnt even think i would be here thats something i take great pride in thats something that has made me a stronger person
7238797 i felt like i was representing all the trampoliners before me that didnt have the opportunity for the olympics athens was special because it was where the olympics started and all the history there
7238798 here this one meant so much because of the journey i had to go through this year coming back from injury that will be with me for a long time
7238799 you dont really have the feeling of falling youre jumping its very different
7238800 i dont know why im scared of heights ive been like that for a long time it is kind of funny i do trampoline i jump 20 feet in the air but to me its really different
7238801 i think its going to be great at the grassroots level for all the young children in china
7238802 you can tell how much the chinese have enjoyed having the games
7238803 i think it will help them keep excelling and be one of the top countries in sport

7238822 the real life superhero you dreamed of being as a kid
7238823 i always thought he was invincible a small town superman the big brother who would rip off his shirt displaying a yellow s on his chest and shoot off into the sky
7238824 well i apparently saw him as the wrong superhero he was captain america super soldier patriot and the only superhero who could die
7238825 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7238826 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys

7238836 i dont think they will be that happy coming here this early in the season
7238837 in fact i dont think anyone is that happy coming to wigan because they know were not a side who just lie down and give up
7238838 on our day we are more than capable of beating them
7238839 you have to be physical against any of the top four youve got to try and put them off their game a little bit
7238840 they are an awesome side to be facing we all know that
7238841 i saw them last week and they passed the ball around so well
7238842 you know a team with their talent is always capable of damaging you
7238843 but we have our own tactics in mind and the manager will make sure we are more than ready for them

7238900 im very honoured i came here to achieve a goal and although im disappointed with the outcome in the competition its great to be recognised in this way
7238901 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself
7238902 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7238903 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work
7238904 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7238905 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7238906 the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom

7238910 now nine months on he looks amazing he has put on nearly two stone in weight his skin is glowing with health and he is so relaxed and happy
7238911 but while blake has been inside amy has gone disastrously downhill

7238944 today we the undersigned representing the group have submitted a gbc resolution proposal to change the design of the tvp it has been sent to the executive committee of the gbc in the hope that it will be put on the agenda of the gbc meeting in mumbai in october
7238945 we are now trying to determine before that gbc meeting whether or not the majority of devotees and leaders in iskcon approve of the capitol design and think it is what srila prabhupada really wanted we are doing this by sending articles and letters to internet forums and web sites and asking the devotees to vote
7238946 all of us much appreciate your and your teams dedicated service as the backer and the planners of the current design you understandably hope it will be possible to complete construction of the tvp within your lifetimes and you deserve respect for wishing to fulfill srila prabhupadas desire as soon as possible it is not clear however that changing the design would necessarily have to delay the tvp for very long
7238947 our position is that the decision to build the current capitol inspired temple should be changed in favor of a first class indian design
7238948 the sections that follow will be included also in the letters and postings to devotees as well as in the gbc resolution proposal
7238949 the architectural culture theyll come to see the civilization culture the philosophical culture the religious culture
7238950 2 the purpose of the planetarium to display the vedic cosmology is thwarted by the u s capitol design the exterior is the first impression people will get our first statement to the public and it will be the only one on many pictures but people will be puzzled as to what it is it looks like a government building rather than a temple with an added crescent moon and star or a cross on top of the dome it could be taken to be a mosque or a church and western renaissance and neoclassical architecture symbolize a different worldview than the one the planetarium temple has as its purpose to display the architecture represented by the u s capitol was partly inspired precisely by the modern western scientific cosmology to which the vedic planetarium is intended to provide an alternative
7238951 3 the design is eclectic i e it represents a poor artificial external combination of disparate western and indian architectural elements rather than a mature integral credible synthesis suggestions please 4 the designs combination of eastern and predominantly western architectural elements is considered by some to symbolize the synthesis of east and west explained metaphorically as the cooperation of a lame and a blind man that iskcon as a whole is often seen as representing but this view of iskcon is problematically one sided although the idea of east west synthesis and its architectural and other symbolization is relevant in the west it is less so in the most important dhama of gaudiya vaishnavism in india and at iskcons international headquarters srila prabhupadas samadhi already includes western architectural elements to an extent that is controversial to some but since it is relatively successful as an east west stylistic synthesis in comparison with the current tvp design this may be acceptable as a symbolization of srila prabhupadas personal prioritization of the west in the sense of his choosing to first take gaudiya vaishnavism there yet the mission of srila prabhupada is a global one bringing gaudiya vaishnavism to all cultures and civilizations and thus producing also other syntheses than that of the east and the west and the east of course includes other cultures than that of hindu india it would therefore be wrong to symbolically link the whole of the gaudiya vaishnava tradition to the west as the current tvp design does the tvp should represent neutrally in relation to all other cultures only the vedic tradition in the language of its architectural form
7238952 5 the current design gives misleading american and disney associations and connects iskcon with problematic arrogantly imperialistic american politics and culture problematic not least in view of the spiritual mission of gaudiya vaishnavism the u s capitol is of course a western architectural masterpiece as are even more the european domed buildings like brunelleschis santa maria del fiore in florence and michelangelos st peters in rome from which the designers also draw inspiration the u s capitol was also built at a time when the u s a represented other values and ideas but the very idea of building today a temple resembling the u s capitol in mayapur india is disneyesque and the kitsch features of the design add to this impression the design will reinforce and consolidate the view of the critics who regard iskcon as an all american sect the assertion by hari sauri prabhu see dandavats that american culture has conquered the world even suggests that the associations and the critics view are correct iskcons western leaders may even be pushing their capitol design on the mayapur management without its support the design will compromise iskcon and diminish its srila prabhupadas and ambarisa prabhus reputations this central iskcon temple should instead express only the integrity the authenticity the unadulteratedness the primordiality the bona fidelity the authority and the beauty of the vedic tradition on which srila prabhupada always put so much emphasis and which iskcon must to a much greater extent than today be seen as representing in the rest of the world 6 tourists will want an indian style temple if they want to see renaissance and neoclassical architecture they go to florence rome paris london or washington and get the real thing
7238953 7 much work has already with the support of ambarisa prabhu been done on first class indian designs locating the temple in a congested area is architecturally far inferior to surrounding it with open space and building it without provision for creating a tourism infrastructure will defeat the main purpose of attracting and hosting visitors especially international tourists our efforts to overcome the current obstacles to acquiring land from the west bengal government have been frustrated but iskcons influential members in mumbai delhi and calcutta could become involved in negotiations with this government support might even be gained from the central government of india since with the mentioned indian designs the project can be presented as being of even greater national importance than the swaminarayan akshardham in new delhi the government approved swaminarayan project did not involve a vast international community of foreigners friendly to india as our tvp project does a world class indian design produced by the best professional architects would be a cultural and religious project of historical importance fulfilling in its grandeur lord nityanandas prophecy that is the only kind of project worthy of mayapur and of srila prabhupada
7238954 8 if for some reasons the temple must be built on the lotus park one of the previous designs could be scaled down or a new indian one of the required size could be produced within a year or two
7238955 not met a single person who likes this design and a lot of people come through vrindavan
7238956 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7238957 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7238958 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7238959 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7238960 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7238961 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7238962 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7238963 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7238964 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7238965 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7238966 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7238967 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7238968 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7238969 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7238970 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7238971 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7238972 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7238973 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7238974 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7238975 aber wir k nnen durch den sport zu positiven ver nderungen beitragen und tun dies auch
7238976 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7238977 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7238978 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7238979 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7238980 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7238981 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7238982 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7238983 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7238984 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7238985 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7238986 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7238987 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7238988 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7238989 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7238990 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7238991 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7238992 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7238993 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7238994 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7238995 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7238996 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7238997 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7238998 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7238999 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7239000 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7239001 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7239002 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7239003 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7239004 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7239005 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7239006 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7239007 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7239008 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7239009 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7239010 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7239011 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7239017 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7239018 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7239019 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7239020 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7239021 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7239022 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7239023 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region

7239041 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7239042 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7239043 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7239044 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7239045 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7239046 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7239047 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7239048 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

7239064 you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7239065 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

7239075 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7239076 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7239077 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7239078 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

7239093 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy to chinalco acquiring a shareholding interest of up to 14 99 percent of rio tinto plc on the basis of chinalco making two undertakings
7239094 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7239095 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7239096 we always knew it would be close its always difficult to beat an incumbent
7239097 shaheen spent 700 000 this summer and didnt move her numbers at all
7239098 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7239099 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7239100 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7239101 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7239102 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7239103 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7239104 its a way for me to feel like im doing my part
7239105 things are going all right im getting more adjusted to it now
7239106 we have seen an increased use of our ptsd resources by these veterans
7239107 the reality is its treatable and veterans can lead a very healthy life
7239108 these are just images that are going to stay with me for the rest of my life
7239109 i believe to this day i have the record with the longest sniper kill in afghanistan with the m 14 rifle
7239110 i couldnt believe it was just a kid when i saw what my round did to him
7239111 in all my dreams he just stops and looks at me and thats when the dreams over
7239112 he was terminated for a character issue not a medical issue
7239113 i think one of a producers greatest talents is to be able to listen to a bunch of conversations going on at once the grips and electricians talking to one another the talent talking to the director over my shoulder everyones problems become my problem so i can figure them out before they become each others problems
7239114 there are tremendous curveballs thrown at you during filming she lets you know when youre hearing something you dont want to hear that its going to be ok its like a warm hand on the shoulder that soothes rather than amplifies the conflict
7239115 a little sexist it paints the women as shrews as humorless and uptight and it paints the men as lovable goofy fun loving guys
7239116 i dont share that opinion i feel like we have very strong women in our movies
7239117 its good early training to have an incredibly irresponsible family it forces a young person to take responsibility to be organized
7239118 i want to make sure he and i are on the same page
7239119 you may not eat well you may not sleep well you may have some anxiety issues
7239120 if its affecting your relationship with your family then its a problem
7239121 when asked how hard it would be to give up a specific technology respondents are now more likely to say the cell phone would be the most difficult to do without followed by the internet tv and landline telephone
7239122 embraced the brave new world with more devices per capita they liberally use technology devices and applications for both personal and business use
7239123 they are reasonably happy with their work life balance even though they use almost all devices and applications for both
7239124 they are willing to communicate with work on vacation in restaurants from bed and even in places of worship
7239125 its not under way through no lack of effort but a lack of funding at this point
7239126 im hoping that eventually it does happen because we keep losing houses not that i want houses in because of floods
7239127 hopefully theyll buy us out before the next flood happens
7239128 at this time theres insufficient funds to do the project
7239129 the project has not gone away the project is on hold to be able to purchase it
7239130 i sit here every other day and think theyre gonna come and say you got 60 days to move out
7239131 some people may have gotten rental assistance others may have gotten money for home repair
7239132 some may have gotten both or other forms of aid
7239133 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7239134 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7239135 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7239136 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7239137 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7239138 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7239139 if the economy wasnt this way i wouldve gotten a job in a short period of time and it wouldve stopped the progression of everything else that happened
7239140 were a very small operation and we have very limited funding
7239141 we have never had a may june july and august where we have not only every bed that we have in the state occupied but we have waiting lists
7239142 and in some places we have waiting lists of eight to 10 people for a bed a bed
7239143 by the number of applications were seeing the need is greater and we do attribute that to the fact that they have no money people are living in cars people are sleeping on couches and that gets old
7239144 this is the first summer ive spent where almost every day we are full
7239145 the only reason i have anything open today is i had a family relocate and two men moved out i guarantee by tomorrow itll be full again
7239146 its easy to bounce back when you have one thing go wrong
7239147 said spader who has never lived in a shelter until now
7239148 but then when you lose your job and then you lose shelter and then you lose transportation its very very difficult its a cycle you cant get a job if you cant get there but you cant get a car if you dont have a job
7239149 its much more difficult for individuals grappling with emotional programs to compete successfully in the economic arena
7239150 its harder for them to focus on issues of livelihood when they are depressed they cant sleep or theyre drinking too much
7239151 everywhere across the country people are dealing with veterans in crisis and we have to assume that this is going to eventually impact us here
7239152 we were a resource to veterans struggling with addiction because they could utilize our shelter while they were dealing with this
7239153 post implementation of the city councils requirements we will be required to bar them
7239154 its disgraceful that people who served their country come home to live on the streets
7239155 my fear is thats going to grow with the economy this way
7239156 right now there are not a whole lot of good employment opportunities out there
7239157 i dont like putting chemicals in my body i like natural ways of warding off disease and healing
7239158 if you come in with a specific ailment she can recommend a specific product for you
7239159 you dont want to feel like you left a drugstore
7239160 life is so full of stress that anything that can be relaxing is so important
7239161 i know when im falling asleep because i try to think of something and i cant
7239162 its a product thats been around for 80 years and people just dont know about it
7239163 i really really love educating people about whats out there
7239164 im not going to sell them a product that doesnt work
7239165 im finally realizing wow hes not my baby anymore hes going off to school its that kind of reality hes all grown up now and i cant believe hes off to kindergarten
7239166 over the years ive watched a lot of parents cry
7239167 the kids tend to focus in on other kids especially if theyve never been around them much theyre all excited about kindergarten
7239168 so for the kids its all new and wonderful like disneyland but for the parents its oh no what if my child needs something and the teacher isnt paying attention to them or what if some other child is mean to them so theyre the ones that are worried
7239169 once a week or two has passed its like old hat i think its just trusting these teachers and the staff with the safety of their children and its a big step
7239170 you just hope youve prepared them to make the right decisions
7239171 everythings going to be ok that people have been going to school for years and itll be all right
7239172 just give them a hug and a kiss at the door and send them off
7239173 parents really should calm down and know that the teacher is ready for the kids and the teacher has seen a lot of kindergartners over time dobry says
7239174 i think the very first one going to kindergarten its all new to the parents and a lot of parents are a little worried
7239175 the first one was the hardest we were really close and it was hard for me to let go of him
7239176 he was in day care while i worked but it was just the mental thing for me
7239177 now he was growing up he was my baby until he was in school
7239178 when the second one went to school i was like yay i was excited i couldnt wait for the kids to be in school
7239179 i was a very bossy child and i loved how j
7239180 and the show itself just seemed like an incredible fantasy to me because i didnt grow up around money
7239181 people are always interested in what is not like them
7239182 they know their friends and family they dont know the superrich some of this is curiosity some of it is envy some of it is jealousy some of it is snarkiness
7239183 its interesting because when you look at when shows like this were very popular dynasty and dallas back in the day they debuted when there were economic hard times
7239184 and so a lot of times when the country goes through times like these where were in what is perceived by many as a recession having entertainment be escapist entertainment is what our viewers look for
7239185 on one hand it is acceptable in popular culture to show a fantasy lifestyle contrary to what most people are experiencing think about the kind of escapist films produced during the great depression for instance on the other hand there is a fine balance that must be struck so that the public is not pushed into scoffing at or rejecting portrayals of wealth
7239186 you want to make sure that youre not alienating a lot of viewers across the country who might be in tough financial situations
7239187 tonally we want it to be more like clueless and the devil wears prada
7239188 its a wish fulfillment comedy we want to keep it fun and upbeat
7239189 every woman who has visited our set just says omigod and squeals in delight
7239190 we feel like this central family this core family moves into beverly hills and its about how do they hold onto their sort of moral center
7239191 whether these kids drive maseratis or whatever mansions they live in we want people who watch in iowa going thats how i feel when my dad gets mad at me and thats how i feel when someone doesnt like me
7239192 i think the concept of schadenfreude is operating in the pleasure people have of watching representations of the wealthy
7239193 there is a sense of satisfaction in seeing those who have everything also have dysfunction and problems in their lives that money doesnt guarantee happiness and that the viewers own life is good even if she or he doesnt have as much money there is a moral superiority that non wealthy people can have over those who are wealthy and lead messed up lives
7239194 no phone no lights no motor cars not a single luxury

7239200 it is very easy to translate from tamil into malayalam and vice versa
7239201 i can see that the writer has done a good job with the translation
7239202 i think she would have a lot to say about me i am a very difficult person to live with
7239203 i believe it is not a great idea for an artist to spend a long time talking about himself
7239204 it was katha the delhi based publishing house that opened my eyes to the wealth of literature in tamil i was surprised to find writers in the southern languages writing stories of a very high quality

7239206 because of victories of the war heroes and our economic policy there is a clear build up of peoples support for the alliance parties without the support of the jvp led by its traditional leadership
7239207 this is a lesson to the old leadership of the jvp it is a signal for them to retire the true strength of the jvps old leadership has been exposed
7239208 even on election day our candidates heads were bashed olu paluwa
7239209 traditionally with the exception of a 1994 election in the southern province the ruling party has always won provincial elections
7239210 but these elections encourage the president to go for parliamentary elections the results show that the government could face the electorate without the jvp and get a majority in most districts
7239211 what is important is to emerge as the largest party and get the bonus seat
7239212 the president will analyze the situation in the future and decided whether to go for an election or not
7239213 except for city based people all the communities are represented in the area

7239221 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7239222 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7239223 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7239224 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7239225 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7239226 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7239227 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7239228 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7239229 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7239230 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7239231 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7239232 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7239233 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7239247 correu tudo muito bem e para n s foi uma alegria e uma grande emo o quando o beb nasceu
7239248 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7239249 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7239250 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7239251 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7239252 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7239253 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7239254 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7239255 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7239256 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7239257 we did our best but the best was not enough
7239258 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7239259 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7239260 being on this show has put me off so much food

7239262 we are attempting to move away from focusing too much on the sob stories
7239263 this year its all about trying to go back to raw talent
7239264 the stories got out of hand and people were starting not to believe them it had got to the stage that people were trying harder to gain sympathy than to get praise for their singing
7239265 im curious to see what happens when she comes to the public vote its like a test of forgiveness
7239266 are people willing to forgive someone who has made mistakes shes truly a stunning singer
7239267 this is supposed to be a talent show not jeremy kyle

7239269 we do have national focuses but its not as if we can take over what the provincial responsibility is
7239270 we create a table where we can share best practices we can work on surveillance together on human resources together we still focus on research end of things and the provinces focus on the treatment thats how our tables work its the way our national cancer strategy is working and our national diabetes strategy is working

7239462 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7239463 its going to be a challenge for london and also for all subsequent games i believe and my hope will be that london will put the bar higher

7239467 athens in 2004 was a return to the roots the country that has invented the olympic games china was coming to the most populous country of the world
7239468 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sports the country that has invented the rules of sport and brought in the values of fair play that is the identity that has to be used in london
7239469 london is also a very cosmopolitan city multi ethnic multi cultural multi religious this is also an asset
7239470 the rest i have absolutely no concern the venues will be first class
7239471 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is

7239495 i am honored that senator obama has invited me to speak at the democratic convention in denver
7239496 by electing barack obama president of the united states we have the opportunity to break with the failed policies of the bush administration and john mccain that have made us less safe and less secure as president barack obama will bring forward smarter and more sophisticated international policies that will once again help our nation earn the respect of the world and in turn allow us to build genuine international coalitions to fight terrorism and work to create conditions for peace throughout the world
7239497 there is a strong dose response relationship between the daily quantity of cigarettes smoked and ischemic stroke risk in young women one that reinforces the need for aggressive smoking cessation efforts in young adults
7239498 the odds ratio comparing current smokers to never smokers was 2 6 times greater
7239499 our study adds strong evidence that cutting down helps reduce stroke risk but quitting is unquestionably the best option

7239507 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7239508 i just look at each one as an individual case
7239509 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7239510 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7239511 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7239512 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7239513 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7239514 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say
7239515 i have given you special time that is very good of me you are very fortunate
7239516 mitt f rsta skolminne var krig nu m ste jag uppleva ett till
7239517 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7239518 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7239519 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7239520 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7239521 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7239522 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7239523 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7239524 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7239525 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7239526 we did our best but the best was not enough
7239527 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7239528 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone

7239531 i know what is wrong the air in your tire is low do you want me to go back to the car and get the pump
7239532 no i just want you to stay with me and not leave me behind
7239533 the contrast is huge what is the spiritual equivalent to a tire without air
7239534 are you filling yourself daily with prayer and scripture study or are you going without it
7239535 but even when i am doing those things i can feel like im still lagging behind and not able to keep up emotionally and spiritually like in the summer when its so busy and i read and pray but dont have as much time to truly ponder
7239536 anytime somebody kills a child and there is evidence that it wasnt the first time the child has been abused that ought to be a death penalty case
7239537 id like to talk to rob more about this but that is certainly a class of people that deserves no sympathy
7239538 what rob is talking about sounds like a perfect fit for the overall discussion of the penal code and death penalty
7239539 i would probably be inclined to support something like this but of course i would have to learn more about the details
7239540 how old should i start trying to teach him different words and stuff

7239542 i never thought in a million years that i was ever going to have a problem with working and making money
7239543 it was either pay one bill or pay another or not eat or not have a roof over my head
7239544 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
7239545 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
7239546 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
7239547 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
7239548 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility
7239549 something better to do than look at their coloring or read them a book

7239555 i was always fighting the establishment trying to run through brick walls
7239556 i never had a problem on or off the court
7239557 i thought thats amazing yannick is selling millions of records i thought jeez part of me is happy for him part of me wonders why am i such a bad singer then i thought its great to see him i go through all these emotions i was happy for two days and then i was worrying again about my wife who came over and i had to take her to the eiffel tower i thought im not a tourist
7239558 of all the analysts working in any sport hes as good as any of them
7239559 hes frank to the point where you kind of look at the television and say did he just say that
7239560 another baseball analyst espns joe morgan is admiring enough of mcenroe and his game that he has been called
7239561 is about the will and when mac does a match i learn who has the will
7239562 they suck you in make you feel you have to do more and more and maybe it was just a fluke with him but i saw the guy do the north carolina primary the today show imus msnbc and i am wary of that kind of commitment if youre good you try so hard like russert and the guy drops dead at 58
7239563 how many times can you say that guy hit a good forehand
7239564 really complicated and really simple hes such an interesting puzzle for me to work on
7239565 of all the presidents i ever met the least impressive was mugabe
7239566 giving people an idea of what its like to be out there
7239567 no other athlete in any sport has ever had to go through what i have to
7239568 bad calls not getting what i wanted being a perfectionist wanting everything just right people who had no idea what they were clapping for wanting to change the system tennis was a white upper class sport and i wanted it to be treated like other sports were
7239569 because its hard to be given credit for having mixed feelings about something your friends would think it was inexplicable not to feel it was all amazing in my old weird way my ex wife made sense shed been through a lot and i thought shed understand what i was going through obviously you shouldnt get together for that reason
7239570 it hurts your game when youre done you can get married the thing with john the world opened up to him from tennis
7239571 he definitely gets wounded he just doesnt ever let what people think dictate what he does
7239572 it allows another side of my personality to come through thats maybe not as serious about myself as i seemed when i was playing
7239573 he just seems to love it more than i did i wasnt able to appreciate loving the game as much as i should have
7239574 one of the all time matches that ive seen here
7239575 i hit regularly so i dont lose sight of how difficult it is
7239576 hes an affectionate guy a happy guy and man can he get freaking angry
7239577 he just ices them its the worst you dont want that wind blowing your way
7239578 you always envision something bigger and better the winners we hit then you see all the mistakes it felt magical i wanted it to stay magical
7239579 despite the fact that he was a complete expletive i had complete respect for because no matter how hard im trying hes trying harder
7239580 ever feel like throwing your racket and losing your mind
7239581 given that shes the mother of three of my children i want her to be doing well
7239582 i could have controlled it better my parents always thought so on some level i didnt control it because i didnt want to but i took economics at stanford and its the law of diminishing returns i did feel out of control and i didnt like it maybe what i like so much about what i do now is that im in control
7239583 he plays harder in practice than most guys do in a match
7239584 i can still play well enough to give them what they need
7239585 if this doesnt spark interest in our sport i dont know what will
7239586 thats whats so great about him he gets so emotional
7239587 part of him enjoys chaos he likes things to be a little unsettled wreaking havoc what unsettles others he can handle
7239588 this is where mcenroes patience is starting to wear thin
7239589 as people get richer they want to spend a larger share of their income on health
7239590 is that bad should such a development be arrested should government seek to thwart consumer demand for health care
7239591 public policy ought not be aimed at depressing demand for health
7239592 there are large luxury aspects to health care that are not necessary for basic health rich countries want a lot of convenience with their health care
7239593 do you want mommy to have a baby boy or a baby girl
7239594 joy your babies are so beautiful and i wish i could hold them give them a big hug from gaga the way elaina does reminds me of you abigail makes a facial expression just like you did
7239595 please know that just because i dont cry over you or mention you often doesnt mean that i dont think about you every single day
7239596 when you had to brake hard in the car youd fling your arm out and karate chop my chest in an effort to keep me from flying out the windshield in case we did crash
7239597 when i see you in my mind i see snapshots
7239598 i remember the night you called me up bawling telling me over and over
7239599 before i got married you begged me to come and live with you to care for you
7239600 no mom i have my own life and i dont want to live here
7239601 nearly two weeks passed and i got a call from julie saying that it was the end
7239602 when i reached the hospital it was still dark early morning
7239603 because mom that was the last response we got from you
7239604 i wrote a poem for you like i said i would for the celebration of life ceremony aka funeral
7239605 i dont remember what i said during those days in my letter to you
7239606 id tell you about how abigail is the happiest baby and you just want to squeeze her all the time though shes starting to get sassy again like her mom
7239607 i lived my life and i lived it well i did gods will and i am satisfied

7239611 it provides propaganda to the taliban if they dont take responsibility
7239612 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7239613 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again
7239614 there has definitely been a boom in the egyptian breast enlargement market

7239625 well see i stand by my comments from last year but we did also have horrendous conditions last year with the wind and rain and the course wasnt seen in the right light
7239626 the people there have admitted that they will have to make a few changes before the ryder cup goes there
7239627 i dont throw criticism around lightly i try to be constructive
7239628 gleneagles is one of my favourite places in the world its beautiful but the course didnt light my fire last year
7239629 i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7239630 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure it is going to happen
7239631 this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression
7239632 i dont need to buy mid premier league players i need top players
7239633 i dont want to think i would find a similar environment elsewhere because im happy here
7239634 whenever people say another team is the best in the world i know where i am and how i feel here which is the most important thing
7239635 im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete when you see world football you see very few teams who play the way that we play
7239636 i enjoy the way we play i came here when i was 16 and i feel its my home now i will be lucky to be here as long as i can to play for arsenal
7239637 xabi is my friend of course but apart from that he is a great player
7239638 beating dublin is only a stepping stone to an all ireland semi final and hopefully from there to the final
7239639 wexford are going to be as hard as dublin were and will probably be treated as the same was as us going into the dublin game written off

7239642 we are highly skeptical of the scientific claims regarding global warming and demand that any government actions taken in regards to them must be based upon sound scientific evidence

7239647 the fireball that sits within the earth is a resource
7239648 we walk on it we sleep on it we work on it the question is how do we harness it
7239649 the deeper you drill the more expensive it is geology brings magma and heat closer to the surface in the western u s if we could drill deeper then we could move east

7239661 the topmost issue is the precarious situation of the country which is falling apart and the resolution of the issues would have to be immediately explored
7239662 between the age of 2 and 7 they actually learn language faster than girls after age 7 boys and girls stay on the same trajectory
7239663 for children who are still late talkers in school it is important to provide early intervention and enrichment
7239664 parents should contact a speech pathologist if they have any concerns
7239665 in our large and diverse sample children in families with limited means have as good a chance at starting to talk as those in families with lots of resources
7239666 at this point in time we are not able to give personal details about the couple or the circumstances of how they got into the water
7239667 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
7239668 i love it i know what i said last year about it and the condition of it but i am now in the position where i have to go next week and try to play really well on it
7239669 well see i stand by my comments from last year but we did also have horrendous conditions last year with the wind and rain and the course wasnt seen in the right light
7239670 the people there have admitted that they will have to make a few changes before the ryder cup goes there

7239682 beating dublin is only a stepping stone to an all ireland semi final and hopefully from there to the final
7239683 wexford are going to be as hard as dublin were and will probably be treated as the same was as us going into the dublin game written off
7239684 if people go on what amounts to a starvation diet and just over 500 calories a day is close to a starvation diet they may be liable to run out of nutrients in a relatively short period of time there is nothing magical about what lighterlife offer and nutritionally their programme is very boring
7239685 you dont have to buy expensive products to lose weight and you certainly dont have to believe the hype if people are tempted to try these schemes they should go and see their gp and find out what they can offer our results in the nhs match up to anything that the commercial organisations can offer and nobody is getting rich from it
7239686 it is fairly simple for people to get quite rapid weight loss in a few weeks but the problem is that they dont know how to keep their weight down afterwards they tend to quickly revert back to what they were doing before and it is terribly demoralising to put it all back on again
7239687 there will be some people for whom 12 weeks on a dramatic very low calorie diet could lead them to metabolic trouble
7239688 i am sure that lighterlifes counsellors are very well meaning but they are not professionally qualified why are we allowing them to do this
7239689 in a responsible society it shouldnt be permitted for companies to be marketing and profiteering in this way
7239690 after i completed the 12 week programme my hair started falling out in clumps i couldnt stop crying but my counsellor told not to worry and to concentrate on the fact that i had lost lots of weight
7239691 a very low calorie diet of the sort used by lighterlife used under medical supervision is a safe and effective way for obese people to lose weight
7239692 this programme is only run with the permission of the gp
7239693 patients have to fill in a personal questionnaire and if there is anything in their medical history that can lead to problems then they are excluded from the programme
7239694 although a lot of the counsellors arent medically qualified many of them are nurses and they undergo a prolonged period of training
7239695 some of our 10 non green bottles have together clocked up over 40 000 miles
7239696 environmentally this is madness it takes up to a quarter of a litre of oil and nine litres of water to produce every advertisement one litre of bottled water
7239697 in the uk we have access to some of the best tap water in the world but we still drink more than two billion bottles of water each year
7239698 and its you you are whatever a moon has always meant

7239707 jack vettriano is a controversial figure and a lot of people like to slate his work but the public and collectors absolutely love his paintings we have had lots of interest in his work
7239708 there has also been a lot of interest in peter howsons paintings i am confident he will do well on the night
7239709 while osteria lintrepido may be the first to win an award of excellence for an imaginary restaurant its unlikely that it was the first submission that didnt accurately reflect the contents of a restaurants wine cellar
7239710 we do promise to evaluate their wine lists fairly we assume that if we receive a wine list the restaurant does in fact exist

7239726 it is not about policing on the cheap it is about allowing people to help keep their community safe by volunteering a few hours a week
7239727 many members of the public dont know they can join the police and make a difference to where they live and this campaign is about changing that

7239731 we arent seeing any serious progress in the fight against corruption
7239732 part of the money used to recapitalize the austral bank came from swedish taxpayers and so we are concerned that the case has not been cleared up schools and hospitals could have been built with the money that was criminally removed from the bank

7239736 it is too early to tell if africas time has come
7239737 the global food crisis exposes the fragility of sub saharan economic progress
7239738 we might ask whether africas new democracies are democracies at all
7239739 elections themselves need not force leaders to serve the public good
7239740 there is a simple process at work africa is learning from its mistakes
7239741 a learning agenda is the key to africas economic future
7239742 take now your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the land of moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which i shall tell you
7239743 stay here with the donkey the lad and i will go yonder and worship and we will come back to you
7239744 look the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
7239745 my son god will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering
7239746 do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me
7239747 in the mount of the lord it shall be provided
7239748 by myself i have sworn says the lord because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son your only son blessing i will bless you and in multiplying i will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because you have obeyed my voice
7239749 what i am saying is this i know that the break up was tough but look on the bright side you are still young mysterious unbelieveably good looking you have a great heart a generous spririt and a sharp intellect that at times cannot be matched you have the perfect combination that most women find irresistable when the time is right you will find the right woman i promise
7239750 once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself
7239751 will give to each person according to what he has done
7239752 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
7239753 ho sempre desiderato lavorare con robert e mi sono trovato subito daccordo con bryan lourd della caa lagenzia che lo rappresenta sulle potenzialit della sceneggiatura e sulla reale possibilit che potesse piacergli
7239754 il nostro incontro a new york qualche tempo pi tardi andato esattamente come speravo bob si detto subito entusiasta del ruolo e quando gli ho chiesto chi voleva al suo fianco non ha esitato a fare il nome del suo amico al per noto che al pacino sceglie molto accuratamente i suoi progetti e ci vuole sempre parecchio tempo prima che arrivi una risposta questa volta invece andata in maniera diversa
7239755 la sceneggiatura era ottima e non potevo immaginare un solo motivo per rifiutarla
7239756 quando ho visto de niro e pacino per la prima volta eravamo seduti per la lettura dello script avevo le gambe che mi tremavano sotto il tavolo ho amato tantissimi loro film e pensare di essere nella loro stessa stanza stato assolutamente eccitante

7239807 dellesito della trattativa portata a termine con la lega professionisti con la mediazione della federcalcio e fermo restando le posizioni di principio di partenza
7239808 we were out husseled sic at both ends of the floor we turned the ball over 90 times and gave up a lot of fast break points they also had 4 to 5 extra chances on every shot because we failed to rebound the ball defense protecting the basketball and getting open looks on offense we need to move the ball better toyota was very good at moving the ball and finding the open man they must have averaged 4 to 5 passes minimum before taking a shot we were around 1 to 2 passes i know this was the first time many of us have played together so i know it will get better i see a lot of talent on this team
7239809 hustle is what killed us more than anything im guilty of that myself as by 10 minutes in i felt like i had nothing left in the tank
7239810 we werent sticking with our guys in man i think we have to try at the beginning of the game to match up better with our strengths
7239811 we need to switch and call out the picks that are set on us screens under the basket need to be used more and i did notice that a bunch of us werent
7239812 there seemed to be a lot of confusion about who was guarding who that lead to a lot of open looks on the perimeter and way too many right underneath the basket for easy layups can i suggest a zone defense to fix that problem 2 guys underneath and 3 guys around the perimeter or some variation of that if not then we need to better communicate who were guarding when a sub comes in my general rule on defense is that if theres more than an arms length between me and the guy im guarding theres too much space for him to work
7239813 zone couldnt be nearly as bad as last night giving up points the thing now is that since we were all nearly drained of energy for the majority of the game a zone would be easier for us to spread and cover until we find ourselves in better shape man cover is not the way to go until we can run the floor the entire game i think that would take the focus off of the ball more and allow us to cover the board more effectively at least giving us a chance to get our composure as a team that has not really played together
7239814 if we communicated better werent quite as rusty thats at least a 15 20 point turnaround right there
7239815 use this as the default and do not ask again
7239816 die w nde hier sind verdammt d nn wei t du das

7239821 people involved in sport from countries where doping used to be routine like in russia and eastern bloc countries are still around and still working in sport as coaches and working closely with athletes it will take a generation to create doping free environments for athletes
7239822 i need them if it takes me coming here waiting six or seven hours then i will
7239823 its tough when you have to make decisions whether to pay the electric bill or go see the doctor
7239824 i called a couple places and it was between 50 and 100 and depending on if you need blood work or x rays it could be more
7239825 i dont walk around with two three hundred dollars in my pocket
7239826 some of the people who come in here are very very sick and they just wouldnt go anywhere if they didnt come here
7239827 if the health plan were to open again tomorrow we would hopefully go back down to maybe seeing 45 patients a night instead of 65 patients a night and thats much more doable
7239828 the only connection between the bay health plan and this clinic is that our number of patients on wednesday nights have gone up by 50 percent because the people of bay county no longer have the choice of getting the health plan
7239829 we cant take care of the 11 000 people in bay county who dont have insurance
7239830 theres no way one little volunteer clinic can be the only answer for that many uninsured people with medical needs
7239831 if you volunteer and meet the people who are coming here your heart goes out to them its all the people who are falling through the cracks
7239832 theres a whole lot of people who arent getting any medical care at all and these people are ending up in emergency rooms seriously ill where it could have been prevented
7239833 almost every week we interview people who just recently lost their job or just recently lost their insurance
7239834 and some of these people are working two or three jobs but they have no benefits
7239835 when these guys pointing at their table are done put them pointing at us there
7239836 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7239837 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7239838 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7239839 las vegas has been on the radar screen for the labor movement for many years now
7239840 las vegas is the center of unionism in the country everyone is watching because theres a lot of activity going on and all sorts of things happening
7239841 this economic environment is very clearly an opportunity for workers to organize
7239842 if you notice when workers really organize in this country it is during a depression not during good economic times whats going to happen is that all the cuts that companies have done where workers dont have a collective bargaining agreement when the economy gets better and they start rolling around most of the time they dont restore those cuts those cuts become part of the landscape
7239843 sort of de facto abridgement of right to work laws
7239844 you might have a latino construction worker whose sister works in a hotel and he hears about hotel maids who can buy houses
7239845 someones walking away with the money and stealing it the workers not getting it we think we have a pretty good case
7239846 although the promised land will not be reached with barack obama as president he will be much better for unions than john mccain
7239847 there can be a lot of posturing on one side or the other
7239848 i can recall situations where the union representative would say this is a real hot button issue for some people wholl be there today so lets both make sure we dont ratchet up the tension level by giving short shrift to it or making offhand comments that can be taken wrong
7239849 if you think everything is fine even though youre paying 3 an hour less than the competition in wages and benefits youre asking to be organized
7239850 theres an old adage out there that bad employees dont bring in unions bad supervisors do
7239851 if the employer is not communicating with employees and assuring them that things are ok during a transition they will look for that support and input from a third party

7239885 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7239886 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok

7239897 the mobs are on rampage along the highway i was attacked in broad daylight at 4 00pm when i was heading toward the valley with a truck loaded with sheep
7239898 we returned after we were assured safe passage along the highway but came to this conclusion that the srinagar jammu highway is unsafe for travelling at least for kashmiri muslims

7239911 f r mich ist immer wieder eine berraschung wie schnell duval eigentlich in die g nge kommt obwohl er wenig erfahrung hat
7239912 in deutschland hat er auch eine sehr gute leistung gezeigt obwohl er seit januar nicht mehr im wrc gesessen ist
7239913 er ist auch bei schotterrallyes gut er hat 2005 in australien gewonnen das war zwar ein bisschen gl cklich aber trotz alledem gewonnen und bei anderen schotterrallyes hat er schon einmal zwischenzeitlich sehr gut ausgesehen wo es ums gewinnen gegangen ist
7239914 wenn es in zukunft loeb j ger gibt dann sind das jari matti latvala und duval wenn er ein auto bekommt
7239915 weil mikko f r mich den zu braven eindruck macht wie ich bei der schweden rallye schon einmal gesagt habe glaube ich dass mikko immer wieder zu brav denkt dass er sagt hier nehme ich vier punkte mit hier f nf punkte da zehn da acht er ist ein punktesammler aber nur rein mit punktesammeln kann man die meisterschaft nicht holen
7239916 das ist kein gro es geheimnis duval ist eigentlich einer der alles ein bisschen an sich vorbeigehen l sst er hat meines wissens nach auch drei vier manager berater was wei ich was er sucht sich immer das aus was f r ihn am besten klingt ich glaube einfach dass ihm selbst vielleicht auch vom auftreten her sehr viel fehlt er l sst sich immer falsch beraten tritt auch dementsprechend unvorbereitet auf
7239917 du kannst nicht mit deinem teamchef reden und dabei in der nase bohren oder telefonieren zum beispiel das klingt hart aber so ist es leider

7239927 sumpah adalah antara dia dengan allah kalau dia melakukan dengan ikhlas orang lain tidak harus mempertikaikannya
7239928 jika kita makan menggunakan sudu dan garpu seperti orang kristian tidak pula menjadikan kita kristian ia bergantung kepada niat kita
7239929 mubahalah bermaksud niat untuk membenarkan ucapan dan alam kes mohd saiful dia mendakwa diliwat dan oleh demikian dia bermubahalah sebagai cara membenarkan ungkapannya dan dia mahu orang menerima ungkapan itu
7239930 dalam islam ia boleh dilakukan di mana mana tidak disyaratkan tempatnya di masjid tetapi jika dibuat dalam masjid pun perbuatan itu tidak salah
7239931 mohd saiful memegangnya mungkin dalam keadaan terdesak dan untuk mendapat kekuatan untuk melakukan mubahalah itu ia tidak salah dan tidak harus dipertikaikan dia hendak supaya orang terima apa yang dia sumpahkan itu sahaja
7239932 tetapi kes liwat ini ulama ulama tidak sependapat sama ada ia boleh disamakan seperti zina atau tidak ada yang kata kes liwat tidak sama seperti zina maka syarat meletakkan empat saksi itu tidak perlu
7239933 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7239934 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7239935 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7239936 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7239937 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7239938 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
