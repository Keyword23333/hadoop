1290000 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1290001 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1290002 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1290003 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1290004 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1290005 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1290006 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1290007 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1290008 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1290009 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1290010 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1290011 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1290012 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1290013 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1290014 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1290015 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1290016 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1290017 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1290018 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1290019 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1290020 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1290021 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1290022 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1290023 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1290024 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1290025 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1290026 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1290027 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1290028 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1290029 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1290030 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
1290031 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1290032 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1290033 rangers may have a big reputation having reached the uefa cup final but we found out last wednesday they are just normal players
1290034 a 0 0 draw at ibrox was a very good result for us because we will win in kaunas
1290035 i really believe we will win 1 0 maybe i will be lucky enough to score the winner
1290036 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1290037 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature

1290040 the center sought to determine how evidence gathered against any given detainee influenced the decision whether to release him center researchers expected to find that the detainees who presented the greatest threat would have been released last or would still be held at guant namo center analysis shows that was not the case the only significant correlation to ones being released the date of his release and status upon release is the nationality of the detainee those from afghanistan pakistan or saudi arabia were more likely to be released and more quickly
1290041 the decisions to release guant namo detainees presumably the worst of the worst were political but its hard to understand the politics guant namo was supposed to make americans safer but some of the most dangerous detainees were released because of their nationality regardless of the evidence the department of defense supposedly gathered against them what our report cant answer is whether that evidence was nonexistent to begin with or whether these releases took place with no regard to our national security
1290042 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1290043 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1290044 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1290045 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1290046 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems

1290051 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1290052 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1290053 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1290054 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1290055 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1290056 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness

1290058 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1290059 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1290060 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1290061 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1290062 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1290063 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1290064 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1290065 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1290066 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1290067 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
1290068 the fall of the berlin wall brought new hope but that very closeness has given rise to new dangers dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean
1290069 we cannot afford to be divided no one nation no matter how large or powerful can defeat such challenges alone none of us can deny these threats or escape responsibility in meeting them
1290070 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1290071 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1290072 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1290073 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1290074 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1290075 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1290076 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1290077 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1290078 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1290079 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1290080 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1290081 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1290082 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1290083 we feel that mlss can help members get the broadest distribution of their listings on the internet to the places where consumer eyes will see them we wanted to provide a solution that requires the least amount of maintenance for our members and does not require members to purchase other products or change their current systems
1290084 listhub allows our members listings to come straight out of the mls onto the key internet sites with the current price and status without our members having to spend time or money to get them there complete with brokerage and agent branding
1290085 when we built listhub in response to the needs of one of our mls customers we knew that we were building a solution to a problem
1290086 it is exciting that listhub continues to be widely received our future plans are to continue development of listhub base on the ongoing feedback we receive so that future broker customers will always be at a competitive advantage in their internet marketing
1290087 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1290088 its incumbent upon all of us to give people a fair chance to succeed
1290089 how do you come home to a family that you have devastated
1290090 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1290091 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
1290092 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
1290093 so what are they saying here i think the deal is that coming in first is best dont you think and from what i can glean 2nd and 3rd arent bad but 4th well 4th is useless but you know im not sure maybe theyll tell me again hey they will

1290095 if you think about how an operating system is loaded its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1290096 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1290097 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1290098 in het ene bed kan een kind liggen dat aan een acute leverziekte lijdt en binnen 24 uur moet worden getransplanteerd omdat het anders overlijdt terwijl in het andere bed een kind ligt dat hersendood is maar nog wel gezonde organen heeft
1290099 op vakantie in spanje zijn ellen en haar broertje op de fiets gestapt en aangereden door een auto wim werd weggeslingerd op de weg en had wat zware kneuzingen ellen kwam met haar hoofd op de stoeprand terecht ik wist direct dit is flink mis
1290100 voor onze vakantie had ik al eens een lezing bijgewoond van de nierstichting over het tekort aan donoren en in het ziekenhuis in barcelona zat ik in de wachtkamer toevallig naast een nederlandse moeder wier dochter dringend een nieuwe nier nodig had ik heb de arts gezegd dat de manier waarop ellen geleefd had ze nog n ding moest doen en dat was donor worden het paste zo bij haar ellen was een meisje dat altijd alles weggaf zelfs haar laatste snoepje
1290101 vorig jaar zijn zes kinderen overleden omdat er geen orgaan beschikbaar was in nederland staan voor alle organen ongeveer 70 kinderen op de wachtlijst voor de eurotransplant landen met wie we samenwerken ligt het aantal rond de 240
1290102 toevallig hebben we gisteren een levertransplantatie uitgevoerd waarbij een kind een deel van de lever van een volwassene heeft gekregen
1290103 soms hebben ouders al over die keuze nagedacht bijvoorbeeld omdat hun kind zelf op een wachtlijst voor orgaantransplantatie heeft gestaan maar de meeste ouderparen voelen zich overvallen als je die vraag voorlegt ze hebben verdriet en als arts moet je hen de ruimte geven het droevige nieuws over hun zoon of dochter te laten doordringen ieder heeft het recht te weigeren
1290104 een uitname wordt met zoveel respect gedaan daar hoef je het niet om te laten bij ellen zag ik alleen een pleister en was de wond keurig gehecht
1290105 via een lespakket kun je kinderen uitleggen wat er gebeurt als een orgaan ziek wordt kinderen moet je informeren en zelf over de vraag laten nadenken of ze na hun dood orgaandonor willen zijn of niet mijn ervaring is dat kinderen van zon jaar of 10 oud genoeg zijn om over donatie een mening te vormen in nederland moet je twaalf jaar zijn voor een donorcodicil ik raad ouders aan met hun kinderen in gesprek te gaan een argeloos zinnetje als mam als mij iets overkomt wil ik mijn organen afstaan kan ooit heel waardevol zijn
1290106 from visitor analysis it was found that despite the community being a storehouse of information visitors were not able to access debt related resources in a systematic and organized manner and perhaps that is why they were not spending much time in the site hopefully the new design will make debtcc more user friendly and cater to visitor needs in a better way
1290107 i like the new top menu much clearer the new home page also makes getting to important information easier good job
1290108 it seems the forum has changed and i love the new look
1290109 bikeweek com was re launched in 2007 with more emphasis on motorcycle enthusiasts and their passion for the ride
1290110 there is more emphasis on connecting the community by way of dynamic features and superb event coverage
1290111 there are a lot of ways to be entertained on the internet today and most arent very productive with triviaworld we wanted to provide a pastime that is both entertaining and educational and with prizes to boot
1290112 i dont really miss people i am sad for a bit and then i am okay
1290113 nederland staat derde op de ranglijst van europese landen die gevaarlijk afval exporteren naar landen als ghana

1290118 it has already started a fact which cannot be disputed is the weakening of human beings in the west while in the east they are becoming firmer and stronger
1290119 any system open to human liberty as it actually is must necessarily abound in visible signs of sinfulness

1290124 the last time we took stock there were some 650 captives operating in india
1290125 from plain and simple cost arbitrage india is today offering tremendous value arbitrage
1290126 low cost does not mean low technology simple low cost solutions often require very complex technology
1290127 we often underestimate the innovative prowess of the domestic players and have so far been looking for technological innovations from the west
1290128 with the launch of innovative products like tata nano and hcl mileap that perception is slowly but surely changing
1290129 the hcl labs serve as hubs of technological innovation and the design centers of future hcl products and solutions
1290130 india is emerging as an r amp d powerhouse its not that india is doing only simple coding work for the global products indian captives are today a major source of innovations
1290131 india has a very strong domestic market that is increasingly getting more prosperous unlike other economies india is not dependent only on exports
1290132 the solutions for india are very different from the solutions multinationals undertake for the developed world
1290133 these business pcs have a high performance machine that has the ability to withstand harsh indian working conditions and delivers productivity and efficiency consistently
1290134 with a small form factor these desktops are ideal for organizations that struggle with challenges such as space limitations data security and power consumption especially in the ites sector
1290135 the next set of potential consumers for mncs are those that live in emerging economies of india china brazil and russia therefore there is little sense in replicating products developed for the western markets

1290138 you hold on to the handle and you can move it right and left and forwards and backwards its like a mouse but you can also move it up and down so you can move it in full 3d and then when you touch something on the screen or you swing a golf club or shoot a basketball or a gun or whatever you actually feel it so its got a real high fidelity sense of touch
1290139 you hold onto the handle and you can bring the club you know while tigers holding it up to the right by moving the falcon up to the right and you feel the weight of the club and you feel its momentum and its inertia
1290140 and then when you swing through you feel when it impacts the ball and if you undercut the ball it makes it pop up if you top it it makes it not go as far if you if you slice across it while youre hitting it it makes it slice through the air and so you get this dynamic where you really develop muscle memory just like real life golf
1290141 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes

1290148 its a wacky way to go out weve even had a casino on board
1290149 toen kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions leaguewedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze
1290150 ik heb uitvoerig met ruud gesproken en wil en kan niet anders dan zijn besluit respecteren
1290151 uiteraard ga je bij dit soort beslissingen niet over n nacht ijs ik heb met oranje een heel fijn ek achter de rug en kijk daar met een goed gevoel op terug
1290152 zittende huurders worden door hen vaak op agressieve of intimiderende wijze bejegend en flink onder druk gezet om in te stemmen met opzegging van de huur
1290153 vorig seizoen leek valencia mijn nieuwe club te gaan worden dat liep anders en daarover was ik teleurgesteld nu is het real madrid geworden de grootste club van de wereld en zo blijkt maar weer dat een transfer van veel factoren afhankelijk is welke club meldt zich op welk moment en wat is er wel en niet bespreekbaar voor de club waar je dan onder contract staat
1290154 heel mijn loopbaan hoop ik al dat ik ooit in spanje terecht zou komen nu is het zover
1290155 natuurlijk hopen we dat rafael ooit triomfen zal vieren in spanje maar het is hier wel anders het publiek is anders de opvattingen zijn anders de hele samenleving is anders vergeet dat niet als je de eerste drie wedstrijden prima speelt dan heb je een paar jaar geen last maar als het in het begin moeizaam gaat word je daar nog lang door achtervolgd

1290167 there was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but im still here and im happy with that
1290168 its not a problem for me to stay here and thats what people have to understand
1290169 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you
1290170 to me theres no point when i have all that at celtic
1290171 im really happy in my football and in my life right now i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good
1290172 while you have a meal do some work or have a conversation with a boring friend
1290173 other potential witnesses all have answered questions voluntarily including doctors ledgers ex girlfriend michelle williams and anyone who was in his apartment around the time of his death
1290174 every year i look forward very much to coming out here because there are so many nice devotees here so much nice preaching going on so i always feel very happy to be in krasnoyarsk
1290175 so said guru maharaj it is specific arrangement of the lord that you are all under the shelter of the deities here it is not coincidence and now after so many years of working hard in different ways they have moved into their new home and we have a good fortune to come and be able to render service to them so we should really look after them very nicely and spread their glories all over krasnoyarsk
1290176 previous year i spoke russian very very bad but this year i speak it very bad better than previous year
1290177 there are so many nice devotees here in krasnoyarsk send them some of your maha prasadam
1290178 the supreme personality of godhead said my dear arjuna because you are never envious of me i will impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence
1290179 as a devotee hears more and more about the supreme lord he becomes enlightened this hearing process is recommended in the srimad bhagavatam and guru maharaj continues the theme of the importance of hearing
1290180 how do you find this description ive given to you
1290181 no dont think about it too much but hear about it from a devotee
1290182 so then srila prabhupada goes on to talk about different degrees of confidentiality of knowledge as presented in bhagavad gita
1290183 what is brahman you are realizing krsna and brahman is krsna minus his form and minus his personality
1290184 we were told a story of one famous devotee named jayananda
1290185 i would like to make some prasadam and take and give it to the prisoners
1290186 no problem we will make some first class strawberry halava and some first class ladu
1290187 i think we have to test the halava to see if it is ok
1290188 you know it was very good i think we should have a little more
1290189 you know thats very good halava i think we should have a little more
1290190 what are we gonna do we told the devotee we would bring prasadam for the prisoners but we finished it all
1290191 oh is that food you cant bring food into the prison
1290192 i decided to join narayana maharaj please let me go
1290193 im just trying to help you cause if you go it will make you no good
1290194 its all right youll do it later now you just carry on with the feast and all
1290195 well im glad that now you understand it right for i worried about you a little
1290196 we are risk assessing every single patient that comes to belfast trust
1290197 if we have any concerns about those patients they go into a sideroom
1290198 weve worked hard to increase the number of side rooms weve also created a specialist ward for those cases so theyre not spread out around the hospital
1290199 we are looking very closely at hospitals which have already experienced serious outbreaks of this condition and were looking at what theyve done and put in place to reduce their numbers
1290200 we have actually brought over a team from england called the safer cleaner hospitals team to tell us about what approaches are being used and are having good success in great britain

1290207 they would be able to fly inside buildings entering through windows and doors inconspicuously
1290208 i have not seen it with my own eyes but one of the scientists said she was able to steer it
1290209 it looks to me like animals are shifting their distribution to find prey
1290210 the more that a ceo is paid in stock options the more extreme the firms subsequent performance and the greater the likelihood that the extreme performance will be a big loss rather than a big gain
1290211 it tends to impose a more balanced view of risk
1290212 it is your own money you are betting with not just somebody elses
1290213 there is a positive relationship between fraud and high option pay
1290214 that might make the excessive risk takers really go wild
1290215 in real estate youre getting overinflated profits from bor rowing money to get cheap land and then selling at inflated prices and then youve got a stockmarket that is valuing a dol lar of earnings at about 40 or 50 times so youve got a bubble on ton of a bubble
1290216 beef consumption is chosen in this measure because it is responsible for the biggest share of livestock related methane emissions
1290217 this measure could be reduced by shifting to kangaroo meat and or lower meat diets
1290218 the dearth of interim targets may be explained by both major parties hopes that domestic emissions can in future be addressed by unproven technology for capture and burial of emissions from coal power plants
1290219 yet even the world coal institute concedes that only nine coal power plants with carbon capture and storage plants are likely to be operating by 2020
1290220 for contractors to hire a con struction engineer it is incredibly dear compared with four years ago
1290221 so many of you were so concerned you stunned me
1290222 ortiz was probably one of the best people i ever knew
1290223 i never saw him without a smile on his face he had a kind heart a good head on his shoulders and could brighten up anyones day

1290230 regardless of ones personal views on research involving animals this has now become a very different kind of discourse about more fundamental aspects of society
1290231 on monday 4th august at 5pm at ucsc main entrance there will be a gathering of people in demonstration for the support of the fire bombed faculty and against terrorist tactics the demonstration is not about whether or not research on animals is good bad etc this demonstration is about fundamental aspects of society about peaceful tactics towards things situations we do not like violence is not the solution please come to the base of ucsc campus on monday 4th august at 5pm to show your support for peace and to show that terrorism needs to be put to a stop no matter where it occurs and for what cause it is
1290232 were all a community one campus this is a case of domestic terrorism we need to come together as a community and support our fellow slugs
1290233 my opinion on animal research is not important the people who did that did not try all options they did not come out here and picket and rally
1290234 as a working scientist and parent i hope this tragedy this act of terrorism can motivate us all to establish dialogue rather than firebomb homes and property of families in our community
1290235 freedom of speech issues are effected its a challenge to creative expression for everyone this is about all society i feel this event threatens all our opportunities at expression including the media
1290236 this is unacceptable were trying to prevent terrorism abroad and we cant even prevent it here how can they say support animal rights when they are doing things that could kill people
1290237 no animals are used in the psychology department we decided we should have a rally and in less than 24 hours there are 300 to 400 hundred people
1290238 from the perspective of someone that has been arrested over 30 times for civil disobedience and peace and justice issues these folks are counterproductive for their message and issue because it is debatable if their should be animal research and they could make headway against stupid research like cosmetics and they could win support in a place like santa cruz for strict controls on animal research but we are going to have a complete backlash out here
1290239 for example a forum on ending animal research will be a lot harder after this act it will be hard to have a discussion because the focus will be on violence instead of the issues you would think they want to talk about
1290240 when the weatherman did blow things up instead of serious debates about the war in vietnam i think mike said the discussion was about the use of violent tactics instead there is a backlash that wasnt the only thing but that played a big role in getting nixon elected
1290241 harder for people to be taken seriously when they argue an animal rights perspective
1290242 hopes the administration does not use this to overreact against demonstrators for a variety of important issues
1290243 firebombing houses creates a climate of fear police dont take it lightly but this should not effect students
1290244 it shouldnt affect students even if their views are against mine
1290245 not interested in groups that are involved in peaceful nonviolent expression we welcome that weve always tried to provide an environment to expression and potentially prevail in the court of public opinion
1290246 i dont believe there is a policy it could be appropriate to infiltrate if there is a potential for violence

1290248 irans written response to the six countries involved in the nuclear negotiations was handed to officials at the european union by irans ambassador to brussels
1290249 tomorrows meeting i think should literally be an effective meeting i think it should also be decisive
1290250 i have also said that we should impeach the dictator who twice violated the constitution and committed high treason
1290251 if there is no progress then we will have to take some decision
1290252 politics both domestic and international along with the macroeconomic scenario are now going to shape the future direction of the market
1290253 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs
1290254 it is just because it is so close to the olympics
1290255 but dont worry this doesnt affect ordinary people like you and me
1290256 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1290257 weapons were similar to those captured by police from an east turkestan terror camp in january 2007
1290258 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1290259 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1290260 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1290261 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs
1290262 win a comprehensive victory in the security battle for the olympics and to protect the harmony and stability of tibetan society
1290263 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1290264 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events our bill becoming law means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1290265 it is a relief to say that this part of our fight is coming to an end theres still more work to be done and the families arent done fighting for the truth
1290266 there are still a lot of things that we want to know
1290267 if you look at history you will see that as a result of the people moving away from the party of government regimes like the nazis have come into power
1290268 i dont want to think that the speaker disclosed them on purpose and i dont have any intention of comparing the democrats to the nazis
1290269 he was saying that the fact that debate has not been progressing in parliament is a serious problem and that the nazi regime arose from a similar situation
1290270 nearly every single possible combination of the childrens meals at kfc taco bell sonic jack in the box and chick fil a is too high in calories
1290271 ninety three percent of 1 474 possible choices at the 13 chains exceed 430 calories an amount that is one third of what the institute of medicine recommends that children aged four through eight should consume in a day
1290272 chilis has 700 possible kids meal combinations but 658 or 94 percent of those are too high in calories including one comprised of country fried chicken crispers cinnamon apples and chocolate milk 1 020 calories and another comprised of cheese pizza home style fries and lemonade 1 000 calories
1290273 only a third of its fresh fit for kids meals which include a mini sub juice box and one of several healthful side items apple slices raisins or yogurt exceed the 430 calorie threshold
1290274 kfc is proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options the kfc information in the report is inaccurate as kfc offers a number of kids meal options well below 430 calories
1290275 on june 30 2008 bkc burger king corp launched a new burger king kids meal that complies with bkcs nutrition criteria
1290276 people may not get a heart attack until their 50s or 60s but arteries begin to clog in childhood
1290277 most of these kids meals appear to be designed to put americas children on the fast track to obesity disability heart attack or diabetes
1290278 the city has some of the worst congestion in china we were worried there would be traffic difficulties and also that the crowds would be too large
1290279 political freedom as the western world has known it is only a political reading of the bible
1290280 belief in a transcendent order or body of natural law which rules society as well as conscience political problems at bottom are religious and moral problems
1290281 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1290282 it is necessary that our courts recognize that the religion based harassing conduct that took place in this workplace culture is as offensive as other forms of discriminatory harassing conduct outlawed in this state
1290283 there is no reason to make fun of peoples religion or race or anything
1290284 it sends a clear and unequivocal message that anti semitism has to be treated with the same degree of severity as racial harassment
1290285 the court has raised the bar on the hostile work environment now you cant even joke in the workplace

1290304 i dont know if i can take that kind of pain
1290305 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

1290307 a favorite son candidate is not the same thing as a real candidate if you enter the primary as a favorite son the major candidates wont enter the race so well avoid a disastrous primary fight as governor youll win the primary but that only means youll head the delegation to the convention
1290308 ill do that ill enter my name as a favorite son but thats all and only on one condition that our delegation be representative of all sides in this split not just one group
1290309 the decrease was primarily the result of a 19 08 billion yen decline in net sales at the mobile communications segment on a decline in handset sales this was caused by a decrease in the number of handset upgrades and others and a decline in average revenue per user even though the business had steady growth in the number of subscribers year on year
1290310 the deterioration in market conditions particularly the downturn in the housing market and the need to ensure an adequate regulatory capital position throughout the period of state aid and temporary public ownership have led to the need to strengthen the capital position of the company
1290311 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1290312 but of course it does mean that this debt will not be repaid by the company so the only way the government and hence the taxpayer can get their money back is from future dividends on the new equity or from a future sale of the business
1290313 creo que en torno a l ha surgido un tremendo estruendo para entre otras cosas crear una especie de alarma lo que tengo claro es lo que yo har a marcar distancias y alejarse porque no le van a dejar en paz ni a l ni a la familia
1290314 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido y con todo lo que nos debe su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1290315 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1290316 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1290317 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos
1290318 est haciendo una segunda publicidad y est recordando a todos que eta puede matar mucho
1290319 the dismembered carcass of the dog was hung up on a fence and the animals intestines were found in a bag

1290321 because of the impact the electricity crisis has had all sectors will be affected
1290322 because we are talking now to other trade union federations
1290323 we will monitor the strike but no schools will close and principals will have to monitor the pupils and keep in touch for a contingency plan
1290324 this is against the drastic increases in electricity prices and the rising prices in the country and this has had a major effect on the poor
1290325 we respect the rights of any union to march as long as there is no violence and vandalism and they do not interfere with the lives of those people who are not involved
1290326 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
1290327 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
1290328 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
1290329 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
1290330 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
1290331 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
1290332 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
1290333 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
1290334 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
1290335 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
1290336 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
1290337 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
1290338 wrexham were a strong side but we made them look good as well we were that poor wolves are likely to be stronger so we need to put up a fight
1290339 this is a big test in front of what i am hoping will be a big crowd at marston road the last thing i want is another good hiding four days before the season starts
1290340 i would also like to thank wolves manager mick mccarthy and chief executive jez moxey for bringing a strong team down for the game when i took this job they promised they would help in any way they can and they have done
1290341 it is great that a club where i spent 13 years as a player are happy to help me
1290342 wrexham were physically strong and as for their two strikers we could just not muscle them off the ball they had a big target man who could bring the ball down and play
1290343 i would love to bring in a player like that but unfortunately they dont grow on trees out of our strikers nick wellecome is the sort of player we could use in such a role maybe when we return to training that is something we could look at and work on

1290350 india needs more political will and needs to strengthen its healthcare delivery to the poorest of the poor who are not being reached

1290352 i had a job i had an apartment i was engaged to be married to a guy who i should not have married and didnt but i dumped him i dumped the job i left my apartment and didnt come back for seven years i think sometimes in life when some aspects are going really well and some arent you dont change because maybe youve got a great boyfriend but your job stinks or maybe youre making a lot of money but your social life is awful theres always a balance but all of mine were on the low end all at once

1290367 steph a noble woman without any great title you have lost your lands and your frtune to betting on the races die cards and other games you are friends with the lady jessica but have never met her husband duke andrew and are looking forward to doing so the only reason you have been invited to the paty is that it is hosted by your cousin marie however you almost didnt come greatly in debt and needing to fuel your gambling habits you are afraid that one of the loan brokers you owe money to aj will be present she is a member of the kings guard and a soldier but most of her large fortune comes from her other trade if you dont pay up you are afraid of what aj will do to you
1290368 could i interest you in a game of cards cousin you party is dreadfully dull
1290369 yeah well done andrew just stab the dead body to make sure
1290370 convince aj to give you time to repay the money jessica is dead but you are sure in your desperate situation she would help you with your debt attempt to rob her money out of her handbag
1290371 oh wait i forgot i probably shouldnt anger a man with a sword to my throat
1290372 either repay the loan or get aj off your back one way or another if she tries to speak with someone follow them and eavesdrop
1290373 but i would be hanged that is so not worth 500
1290374 okay since youve sort of payed off your debt i will revise the favour to voting for marie

1290381 la destrucci n de los bosques tropicales ha sido siempre la primera causa pero ahora parece que la caza es una amenaza tan seria en algunas reas incluso cuando el h bitat est intacto en muchos lugares los primates est n literalmente siendo devorados por la extinci n
1290382 lo que est sucediendo en el sureste asi tico es aterrador
1290383 tener un grupo de animales bajo tan alta amenaza es francamente no comparable a cualquier otro grupo de especies documentado hasta la fecha
1290384 dentro de las especies africanas los grandes primates como los gorilas y bonobos siempre han generado mucha atenci n y a pesar de que est n altamente amenazados son los primates peque os como el colobo rojo los que pueden morir primero

1290401 i always knew i wanted a baby but i wanted to do it when i felt i had achieved everything else that i wanted to
1290402 but after two years of trying i was panicking and when you are so used to getting what you want through effort it is very hard when nothing happens
1290403 you start looking at all those ovulation charts buying digital thermometers and it just takes over but still nothing happened
1290404 then last year i went to pakistan to film a documentary when i got home i thought enough is enough i am 37 and this career thing could go on for ever but i want to have a baby now i have to find out what is going on
1290405 i got a little obsessed about it all at that point which must have been a bit frightening for steve
1290406 it was a real shock at first as i hadnt had any symptoms
1290407 but there was also a sense of relief that finally i knew why i hadnt been getting pregnant and now i could try to do something about it
1290408 having gone through the stages of thinking you might not have a baby makes having one so precious now when i see him in his cot and his little gums are showing as he starts smiling it is the best start to a day ive ever had

1290418 there is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time
1290419 the law of our torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them this is the real moral behind israels torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals
1290420 a thousand non jewish lives are not worth a jews fingernail
1290421 is considered among the most learned sages of the torah
1290422 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
1290423 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop
1290424 what is hateful to yourself dont do to your fellow human being that is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary
1290425 40 palestinians died after being refused passage out of gaza for urgent medical treatment not available in local hospitals

1290428 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1290429 we ve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis
1290430 republicans have been dominating the debate around gas prices for weeks with their sham drilling plan

1290432 jika kita bicara tentang cara untuk menandai 50 tahun sejak debut bobby moore maka hanya satu sikap sejati yang akan memberinya keadilan yaitu memensiunkan nomor enam milik dia
1290433 saat aku melangkah ke garis lintasan jangan khawatir aku pasti akan siap
1290434 saya sudah mendapatkan sukses yang mencukupi dalam hal berduet dengan penyerang lain selama beberapa tahun jadi saya tahu bahwa liverpool beruntung sekali musim panas ini
1290435 dalam diri fernando torres dan robbie keane liverpool memiliki pasangan penyerang yang sanggup mencetak setidaknya 40 gol itu cukup untuk menyaingi chelsea mu atau arsenal
1290436 keane secara konsisten mencetak 15 atau 20 gol per musim setelah ia pindah dari tottenham ia tentu ingin naik ke level berikutnya sementara torres memiliki kelas dunia dan seharusnya bisa mencetak paling tidak 25 gol jika tidak lebih
1290437 dengan mengatakan itu saya pikir lewis sudah menyiapkan dirinya sendiri untuk menjalani program latihan intens selama tiga pekan ke depan
1290438 jeda ini penting buat para mekanik dan orang orang lain yang melakukan perjalanan bersama kami
1290439 we denken dat veel mensen de passages toch graag aan familie of vrienden willen laten lezen

1290441 ogni individuo ha il diritto di accedere alla prevenzione sanitaria e di ottenere cure mediche alle condizioni stabilite dalle legislazioni e prassi nazionali nella definizione e nellattuazione di tutte le politiche ed attivit dellunione garantito un livello elevato di protezione della salute umana

1290443 questo non ci deve indurre in errore a pensare che questa sia una direttiva sociale
1290444 c stata una possizione tempestosa quando si avuta la fuga di notizie sulla versione del progetto di direttiva per la sanit nel dicembre 2007 e giustamente
1290445 questo progetto stato identificato come una proposta radicale per introdurre elementi di mercato nella sanit il progetto di proposta fu successivamente ritirato dalla commissione allultimo minuto
1290446 la proposta di direttiva basata sullarticolo 95 del trattato e le misure adottate ai sensi di quellartcolo hanno per oggetto linstaurazione ed il funzionamento del mercato interno
1290447 perch investire nei vostri ospedali se potrete inviare i vostri pazienti in un paese a basso costo
1290448 the destruction of the indians of the americas was far and away the gt most massive act of genocide in the history of the world

1290454 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1290455 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1290456 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1290457 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1290458 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1290459 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1290460 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1290461 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1290462 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1290463 the boards action is against the interests of the nation and risks the safety of thousands of american traveling and living abroad
1290464 we must now rely on the u s supreme court to prevent texas from breaking a commitment made by the president and senate on behalf of the country as a whole
1290465 if he had raised the issue at his probable cause hearing the court would have complied and it was never raised
1290466 they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth
1290467 i say again this is a principled decent man entirely uncorrupt
1290468 that means no longer getting a direct hit it looks like this is going to hit anywhere from high island which is where category 1 hurricane humberto hit last year or all the way up to sabine pass
1290469 it looks like its going to making landfall right around lunch time
1290470 if it is a category 1 hurricane when it makes landfall youre going to see the strongest winds to the east
1290471 well still get some pretty good soaking rain showers in houston but the heavy rain amounts are going to be off to the east
1290472 these things move in as a basketball bring in just a lot of rain theyre known as drought busters were in a severe drought in southeast texas and this is bringing in a lot of rain
1290473 if its too dangerous all were going to do is try it out there
1290474 if we cant handle it if it pulls us too much to jetty or anything were going to get out were not completely dumb
1290475 weve got all our snack goodies lots of soda and cokes and candy were prepared going to have a party
1290476 there was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but im still here and im happy with that it is not a problem for me to stay here
1290477 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you
1290478 to me there is no point when i have all that at celtic im really happy in my football and in my life right now
1290479 i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good
1290480 wow john chow is advertising on this blog using entrecard
1290481 story gameplay und die verbindung der leute mit dem spiel ber einen l ngeren zeitraum hinweg
1290482 ich denke was uns betrifft erwachen wir langsam aus unserem bioshock koma von der auslieferung des spiels und der damit verbundenen harten arbeit und dann m ssen wir einen entschluss treffen
1290483 was kommt als n chstes f r uns und wie aggressiv werden wir sein
1290484 wir schauten uns gegenseitig an die jungs haben vielleicht sechs oder jahre zusammengearbeitet all die kreativen leute von bioshock und fragten uns was wir tun wollen wollen wir beim n chsten mal etwas geradlinigeres tun oder wieder alles auf eine karte setzen wir haben uns f r letzteres entschieden
1290485 wir gingen zum unternehmen teilten ihnen das mit und sie antworteten okay lasst es uns so machen ich denke dass wir genau aus diesem grund zusammenarbeiten wir vertrauen uns gegenseitig und sind zur stelle wenn jemand unterst tzung braucht ebenso bringen wir jemanden zum schweigen wenn er verr ckte sachen erz hlt und das ist sehr wichtig wenn man alles auf eine karte setzt
1290486 es gab produkte wie swat 4 mit dem ich sehr wenig zu tun hatte dass die jungs soweit es mich angeht exakt so ausgef hrt haben wie es h tte sein sollen das ziel bestand darin eine fortsetzung zu swat 3 zu produzieren es zu aktualisieren ein sehr spezielles ziel das sie dementsprechend erledigt haben
1290487 das ziel f r unser n chstes projekt ist etwas sehr sehr unterschiedliches es ist ein wenig be ngstigend da wir selbst nicht genau wissen was es ist jeden tag bekommen wir eine klarere wahrnehmung von dem was wir tun und wir entscheiden was ins spiel kommt und was nicht aber es wird aggressiv
1290488 s mtliche download inhalte sind seit dem 30 mai verf gbar
1290489 es ist schon eine weile in arbeit lange bevor die leute etwas von crackdown sahen und wir einen eindruck vom erfolg des titels bekamen es ist das uneheliche kind von allem wonach wir in den den letzten 15 bis 20 jahren in denen realtime worlds dma und david jones spiele machten gestrebt haben
1290490 es ist die richtung in die wir mit dem sandbox gameplay und allem das mit grand theft auto startete und sich ber crackdown weiterentwickelte gehen wollen

1290495 kita akan ekspansi ke nasionalis dan sekuler yang segmen pemilihnya masih besar
1290496 lihat saja pemilu 2004 partai partai yang menang kan yang nasionalis seperti golkar pdip dan demokrat
1290497 dalam mukernas majelis syuro pks akan bersidang di antaranya membahas soal model pks menjadi partai terbuka
1290498 kami tidak malu malu mengatakan kalau pks ingin menjadi partai penguasa
1290499 hal itu sebagai komitmen partai tersebut untuk menciptakan situasi yang damai dan menghindari lagi kekerasan seperti terorisme atas nama agama
1290500 bila kelompok teroris membentuk kelompok tersendiri akan lebih mudah untuk menumpasnya tapi kini kelompok teroris itu telah masuk ke dalam partai politik sehingga sulit dideteksi
1290501 rencana menjadikan pks sebagai partai terbuka disebutkan dwi sudah dibicarakan sejak lama namun pelaksanaannya menunggu waktu yang tepat

1290505 masih ada lagi satu penyelewengan yang dapat menjauhkan dakwah dari jalan yang benar yaitu memandang enteng dan ringan terhadap peranan tarbiyah pendidikan pembentukan dan perlunya beriltizam dengan ajaran islam dalam membentuk dasar dan asas yang teguh kemudian dengan tergesa gesa kita mempergunakan cara dan uslub politik menurut sikap dan cara partai partai politik kita akan mudah terpedaya dengan kuantitas angota yang diambil dan dianggap menguntungkan tanpa mewujudkan iltizam tarbiya inilah satu jalan dan cara yang sangat berbahaya yang tidak dapat dipercayai hasilnya dan tidak mungkin menelorkan anasir anasir yang kukuh dan mampu memikul hasil kemenangan kekukuhan dan kekuatan islam
1290506 sebagai partai dawah penegak keadilan dan kesejahteraan dalam bingkai persatuan ummat dan bangsa
1290507 menyebarluaskan dawah islam dan mencetak kader kadernya sebagai anashir taghyir
1290508 kami sudah mendiskusikan pengenaan udeng itu dengan pemuka agama hindu dan udeng bukan bagian dari agama jadi hal itu tidak mencampuradukkan agama
1290509 barang siapa di antara kalian melihat kemungkaran hal yang keji buruk maka hendaklah ia mengubah kemungkaran itu dengan tangannya jika tidak mampu maka dengan lisannya kalau masih tidak mampu maka dengan hatinya dan itu adalah selemah lemah iman
1290510 sesungguhnya kami berlepas diri daripada kamu dari apa yang kamu sembah selain allah kami ingkari kekafiran mu
1290511 we have a strong finnish tradition in the team and ive seen both mika and kimi take their first grand prix wins while driving for mclaren
1290512 with heikki yesterdays result was fully justified and very much deserved hes had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that hed let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1290513 and weve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling its something they want to keep doing
1290514 clearly we are targeting ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1290515 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from
1290516 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint but unfortunately lewiss tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1290517 the reality is that you cant isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the cars performance
1290518 its a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost weve seen it happen before
1290519 we are undertaking two 50km shakedown tests ahead of valencia were also continually developing new parts for the car as our simulation and development departments continue to produce new parts well take a view as to whether theyll be raced we wont disclose what they are but im sure youll see some new components appear during friday testing at the next race
1290520 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment
1290521 weve been paying very close attention to the construction of the new shorefront circuit in valencia and are convinced it is going to be an exciting addition to the formula 1 calendar and an absolutely top line facility

1290542 dispensasi kepada bank bank yang rekening gironya bersaldo debet untuk tetap mengikuti kliring pada mulanya diberikan dalam jangka waktu tertentu tanpa ada batasan jumlah maksimal namun dalam perkembangan selanjutnya dispensasi tersebut diberikan tanpa batasan waktu dan jumlah maksimal
1290543 dispensasi semacam itu sudah dilakukan oleh bi jauh sebelum krisis menimpa sistem perbankan nasional hal ini terbukti dari adanya beberapa bank yang sudah lama overdraft sebelum krisis namun tidak dikenakan sanksi stop kliring
1290544 dari hasil audit investigasi terhadap penyaluran blbi posisi tanggal 29 januari 1999 yang telah dialihkan menjadi kewajiban pemerintah sebesar rp 144 536 086 juta kami menemukan berbagai penyimpangan terhadap ketentuan yang berlaku kelemahan sistem dan kelalaian dalam penyaluran blbi yang menimbulkan potensi kerugian negara sebesar rp 138 442 026 juta atau 95 78 dari jumlah blbi yang disalurkan pada tanggal tersebut
1290545 jumlah penyimpangan dalam penggunaan blbi untuk transaksi periode sampai dengan 29 januari 1999 sebesar rp 84 842 162 juta atau 58 70 dari jumlah blbi yang disalurkan per 29 januari 1999 sebesar rp 144 536 086 juta

1290602 there is widespread speculation that fomc will hike the fed rate tonight indicating that fighting inflation is a priority this has cooled down all commodity prices including crude oil banking stocks have been moving in the opposite direction of crude oil prices
1290603 lower crude prices will mean lower inflationary pressures and that will lead to stable interest rate regime falling crude is positive for banking stocks
1290604 it is a very short term phenomenon as the demand for crude oil may not cool off in the longer run however strengthening dollar will definitely improve crude oil and commodities prices in near term and in turn lead to a rally in indian markets

1290619 an indianapolis law firm has paid 50 000 to the indiana department of insurance in a deal that extricates it from an 18 million jury verdict stemming from the collapse of a health insurance trust

1290623 a former tech client of thelen reid brown raysman amp steiner has filed a malpractice complaint against the firm and one of its partners and contends the firm concealed that it was simultaneously working for a key competitor
1290624 this is a case about the deceit divided loyalties and gross violations of professional standards and fiduciary duties by thelen reid brown raysman amp steiner
1290625 we generally do not comment on ongoing litigation but we believe the claims made in the lawsuit are without merit and we will vigorously defend against the allegation

1290635 we argued but at the ietf 1992 the universal resource identifier became url the
1290636 lets take a look at this little question and answer game
1290637 these quad machines are very noisy and cause the same noise pollution as motorbikes
1290638 in this instance though weve had many complaints from residents of the villages of mesoyi tala tremithusa emba kissonerga and chlorakas
1290639 we have a campaign to try to eliminate this problem
1290640 at least once a week police are in these areas trying to prevent illegal machines from driving on the road and to stop any offenders lawbreakers are charged and sent to court
1290641 since january we have had around ten such cases and the culprits paid fines ranging from 500 1 000 for various charges
1290642 obviously it would be better if these machines were only permitted for use off road but if they are properly registered the law allows them to be driven on the roads
1290643 we are always grateful for information received from the general public which helps us tackle this and other traffic offences
1290644 but these quad bikes are making life here a misery teenagers ride them and they seem to make continual rounds of the villages in the area
1290645 i think cyprus should ban these bikes from the roads and permit their use only for off road driving which im sure they are more suitable for
1290646 i moved to a village because i wanted some peace after living in the centre of paphos for years it seems as if no corner of paphos is quiet any more i know my neighbours feel as i do
1290647 i would like to know why the parents of these youngsters are allowing them to behave in this way
1290648 if it was my son or daughter i would teach them to respect other people its a sign of the times
1290649 horrible truth was known by only a very few persons
1290650 the plotting tracking and acquisition of articles in deep space
1290651 the roswell incident a book published in 1980 that detailed the crash recovery and subsequent cover up of a ufo with 4 alien bodies has a video tape of 2 newsman interviewing a military officer associated with mj 12
1290652 apparently there is or was an air force project by that name aquarius which dealt with ufos coincidentally there is also an nsa project by that name
1290653 yes that in fact he had been at dulce that it exists
1290654 whatever is under there puts out energy of a city the size of new york theres just all kinds of stuff going on under there thats the update on dulce as far as the greys are concerned there are all types of greys they are definitely cybernetic organisms they are not a species themselves they work for someone else there are several different levels of them there are many instances that indicate that they dont function independently by themselves they operate from higher orders in one particular abduction case somebody had grabbed one and by the movements of the arms they could see that the gray had been programmed to fend off an attack by moving its arms in a certain way all it really had to do was turn around and back away it points out that they are being programmed i would like to cover the incident where the astronauts were supposed to have said that they had an alien spaceship in visual contact apparently after very thorough research by bob oechsler and his group in maryland it turns out that this transmission was sent from a 12 square mile area which included cia headquarters and the nsa facility at fort george meade apparently it was a test of some kind to see if the public would bite
1290655 look i can only support 50 of what you re saying it later became 150 nothing is black or white its all shades of gray cooper did have access to some information in 1973 but not as much as he would like you to believe he did you can take that for what it s worth he has done some very strange things he has threatened me on at least four occasions he thinks that im with the agency and involved in disinformation so thats his deal the other day a guy came up to my house who was out in the forest with charles halt the very first night of the bentwaters incident that something landed there was a rectangular object that landed and he actually jumped on top of it he said he could look down inside the object he has never made any public statement at all i never thought that i would ever get to meet him he did in fact confirm that the incident did in fact happen as far as an update on aids is concerned aids was developed by the navy in 19l2 the specific doctor that developed it was a doctor by the name of r m donner the initial aids research was financed by congress july 1 1969 is when they had the hearings this is a copy of the dod appropriations report for 1970 ed note see july 90 leading edge it was chaired by robert sykes the testimony reveals exactly what they wanted a biological virus for which there was no known immunity they finally got it developed in 1972 and started doing experiments the biggest experiment was in 1977 78 when they released it in africa which is now loo infected in the united states in 1978 79 aids was released to the white male homosexual population through the hepatitis b vaccine the reason they wanted to start with the white male homosexual population was that they wanted to get it to spread very quickly and they thought that people would not worry about it if they thought that only drug abusers or homosexuals were involved that s what happened the navy goal was to infect 75 of the worlds population by april of 1991 those are from top classified government documents whats interesting is that by the present rate of infection 75 of the population will not be infected by the april 91 target so what were looking at is other ways the government may have of spreading this disease i am kind of happy i dont live in california where those helicopters are flying up and down spraying for the medfly whitley streiber i heard the other day that hes become a recluse that hes destroyed emotionally by the reception of communion and his second book majestic even though its an excellent book and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good outline on what the government did in 194l when they recovered the saucer at roswell its an excellent book one of the interesting things about the book is the two autopsy reports in the back they are absolutely the truth i dont know where he got those the original reports about the two aliens whitley used to call me all the time in the middle of the night and chat for two or three hours up until about a year ago a little more about bob oechsler oechsler has done a lot of research in the chesapeake bay area theres really something big going on there basically it appears the hq of mj 12 is back on kent island or somewhere back there a lot of emp research and engineering is going on a lot of underground activity all kinds of stuff whats interesting is that about a year ago he ran into admiral inman who is supposedly one of the mj 12 members bob stopped him and asked to be put in touch with somebody in mj 12 inman took bobs card and looked at him with kind of a half smile and said let me see what i can do
1290656 vortex areas and apparently go underground but if one went down in a different area it would split up into eight blips
1290657 all the worlds spacecraft and went back and found out that after sputnik was launched we had as far as the public was concerned quite an effort to get something up there ourselves
1290658 is it the thing that is coming in from space the agency guy dropped his glass and said how do you know about that thats one of them if we are reorienting sdi in that way that opens a lot of questions about what is going on
1290659 this analysis seems like it would kill any new idea or new channel from getting a real chance to succeed versus your channels that are up and running
1290660 you need to work these leads theyre good inbound leads its not like cold calling
1290661 maybe im the only one who doesnt understand these incented leads but i just dont get why well pay you a coffee card to get a quote or to watch our demo i know it generates leads but so would throwing 3 000 flyers off of the tallest roof in downtown bellevue or seattle im sure both would give us 2 to 5 good leads
1290662 in settlement of the divorce action between them the plaintiff and her former 2 husband george breen entered into stipulations which included agreements as to the disposition of two parcels of land in connecticut jointly owned by the parties which had been conveyed to them in a single deed

1290670 there are some people who like zero and some people who support 1 200 or even higher
1290671 thats the idea to put a warm blanket around alaskans this winter
1290672 i have grave concerns about just handing out dividends to people without it being directly linked to energy relief in their homes
1290673 a new bus service started recently connecting the main cities and airports of cyprus its hoped it will become popular with both visitors and residents

1290676 the heavens proclaim the glory of god the skies display his craftsmanship day after day they continue to speak night after night they make him known they speak without a sound or word their voice is never heard yet their message has gone throughout the earth and their words to all the world
1290677 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1290678 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1290679 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1290680 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1290681 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1290682 you know he was kind of joking around it was his medicine and needed his medicine
1290683 in small communities i think we should look for the good in people instead of the bad and hes been that kind of person ever since ive known him
1290684 i said heres a piece of advice sir when youre in jail here dont tell anyone youre the mayor of shaktoolik
1290685 we prefer it this way and if it went wet again i think wed have more problems
1290686 obviously would not be convenient for a washington d c jury
1290687 a minimal opportunity to personally participate in the electoral process that will decide his professional future
1290688 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
1290689 senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
1290690 if they have evidence this thing suggests why didnt they indict bribery
1290691 it suggests they wanted to prosecute in the district of columbia on the false statement charges because they thought it would be easier to get a conviction here
1290692 maybe they didnt want to prosecute the case in alaska because they were afraid the people up there would have been sympathetic to him
1290693 things are going to come out that they never knew about sen stevens
1290694 once the damning evidence becomes public the house of cards begins to fall
1290695 bring charges on what they can actually prove there may be things out there that they didnt charge because its a little squishy bribery cases are exceeding difficult to prove against a politician
1290696 it is entirely unacceptable for members of congress to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts for businesses that theyre helping with their legislative power
1290697 there is actually no explanation that mr stevens can give that is good enough about why it was okay for bill allen to give him 250 000 worth of gifts
1290698 anytime a united states senator a u s congressman or others are charged with intentionally hiding gifts thats a very serious charge those gift rules are there for a reason theyre there to protect the integrity of our system
1290699 it got me a couple of times and i got her a good couple of times i wasnt going to give the bear an easy target
1290700 i was doing the best i could to stay up on my toes and move all around it
1290701 i figured my best chance was to fight the best i could fight the hardest i could to get away
1290702 i dont think the bears any worse for it but it was probably surprised someone was fighting back
1290703 im glad he didnt just lay there and let it eat him
1290704 im just glad hes ok just glad its not worse than it is
1290705 its the same kind of situation that we had earlier this summer with petra in the sense that its dark a salmon creek and its essentially a dark trail
1290706 were just lucky it wasnt a little kid weve got a lot of 5 and 7 year old kids that live around here and somebody could have got really hurt
1290707 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1290708 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1290709 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again
1290710 i know the stryker brigade from fort wainwright was one of the first brigades to extend and i understand it put stress on the families
1290711 because of the progress we are making in iraq there is now certainty in the rotation
1290712 deployments are difficult but they are necessary we are a nation at war
1290713 it is imperative that this statement be clarified and fully understood immediately any implication that exxon mobil corporation somehow has veto authority is extremely disconcerting for not only legislators but for many alaskans
1290714 clearly neither exxon mobil nor any other party has a veto over the manner in which the state of alaska deals with its oil and gas assets
1290715 it is a common phrase in the energy sector that nothing goes ahead until exxon is happy my wry observation along those lines was not meant as a negative comment on exxon mobil nor was it meant to imply that exxon mobil has any sort of veto on the building of an alaska gas pipeline
1290716 we need customers we need credit in order to build the pipeline
1290717 as we move forward with your company to provide inducements outlined in agia it is more important than ever that misunderstandings and miscommunications be avoided
1290718 draw a distinction between existing and potential conflicts of interest for disclosure purposes
1290719 if you have high water and super fast current the eggs will just go down the river as shes laying them
1290720 most times when weve had floods they happened later on after the fish were done spawning
1290721 this year is different because its right on top of when they should be spawning
1290722 they have to have energy go get to the spawning grounds and then they have to have energy to spawn
1290723 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1290724 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1290725 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter than that of today
1290726 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1290727 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe

1290768 we received a second design win at a major enterprise storage customer and expect to ship qualification units for their end user testing in the third quarter of 2008
1290769 just in the past few weeks we have received qualification notes from another major enterprise server and storage oem that has qualified us on our zeusiops across multiple platforms and we are pretty confident that by the end of this year we will have received more qualifications from the rest of the storage and server markets on zeusiops
1290770 as far as ssds go we have no competition in some of these markets as i have mentioned in many of our calls in previous quarters we see the zeusiops type of product line not to have any competition at least for the next i had mentioned two years about a year ago so i would say that theres at least another year left of anyone coming into that market
1290771 we are again pioneering the use of flash drives this time in midrange storage and have designed these systems to take full advantage of server virtualization technology the clariion cx4 series is unmatched in the industry when it comes to scalability features energy efficiency and ease of use
1290772 todays announcement really validates the innovation of new but established storage companies like compellent that have generated significant momentum in the marketplace customers tell us multiple product lines and models are interim fixes and dont address the real reason these organizations are turning from emc to other brands namely high cost complicated management and inflexibility thats why more than 1 000 customers to date have chosen compellents single integrated platform which unifies storage virtualization innovations like automated tiered storage and thin provisioning features that would require existing emc installations to undergo forklift upgrades to attain

1290777 what jeb bush couldnt do through a republican dominated legislature he is seeking to do through an appointed commission that is only supposed to consider tax and budget issues
1290778 there are some liberal groups who try to protect their political turf at every turn theyre willing to clog up the courts in order to do that
1290779 and we should just see it for what it is a political maneuver by them in this campaign we believe voters ought to have a chance to decide this in november

1290798 psychiatrists get more for three 15 minute medication management visits than for one 45 minute psychotherapy visit
1290799 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1290800 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

1290817 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1290818 exercise behavior in one identical twin predicted anxious and depressive symptoms in the other meaning that if one twin exercised more the other tended to have fewer symptoms too
1290819 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1290820 the authors write but genes involved in the brain pathways that process dopamine norepinephrine opioids or serotonin are likely candidates
1290821 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program

1290824 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder

1290833 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1290834 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1290835 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1290836 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1290837 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds

1290840 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

1290854 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1290855 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1290856 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

1290899 questo sacrificio poi come la stessa passione di cristo sebbene sia offerto per tutti
1290900 il signore riceva dalle tue mani questo sacrificio a lode e gloria del suo nome per il bene nostro e di tutta la sua santa chiesa
1290901 devotamente e con fede i misteri di cristo a lode di dio e santificazione del popolo cristiano secondo la tradizione della chiesa
1290902 troppo grande il mistero delleucaristia perch qualcuno possa permettersi di trattarlo con arbitrio personale che non ne rispetterebbe il carattere sacro e la dimensione universale
1290903 lars celebrandi scaturisce dallobbedienza fedele alle norme liturgiche nella loro completezza poich proprio questo modo di celebrare ad assicurare da duemila anni la vita di fede di tutti i credenti
1290904 unautentica azione liturgica esprime la sacralit del mistero eucaristico questa dovrebbe trasparire nelle parole e nelle azioni del sacerdote celebrante mentre egli intercede presso dio padre sia con i fedeli sia per loro
1290905 lars celebrandi deve favorire il senso del sacro e lutilizzo di quelle forme esteriori che educano a tale senso come ad esempio larmonia del rito delle vesti liturgiche dellarredo e del luogo sacro

1290907 if people saw me theyd probably think i was a nut
1290908 does it translate into hits i dont know ultimately i have to take a good swing and square the ball up
1290909 but i do know that it makes me feel prepared and not feeling prepared is the worst thing that can happen you need to feel good going into an at bat you cant go up there with any doubt i want to think that preparation is a huge help thats why i do it
1290910 for reserve players some of the resources they have these days are a godsend
1290911 pitchers have just as much information as the hitter does
1290912 you have to force yourself to stay in the game
1290913 its a mind set the years when i had the most success i had a manager who would find a way to get me a start now and then so i could get at bats and stay fresh
1290914 i think that helps greg he can play multiple positions and manager charlie manuel can get him a start now and then to keep him sharp
1290915 the other thing i think helps greg is his work ethic i saw it in spring training he puts in quality time in the cage its not just eyewash hes a tremendous asset to that team
1290916 you get one shot usually late in a game in a critical situation against a tough pitcher its a tough job its almost like being a field goal kicker these guys are specialists dobbs is very good at what he does
1290917 pat being familiar with me and believing in me has been a blessing
1290918 in this great game if thats my role i wont fight it
1290919 it takes time things dont happen overnight as ive mentioned over and over
1290920 i was one of those people who felt i would be back here
1290921 pickup is a huge part of my game im excited to get back to it
1290922 ive taken great joy to touch people to make a difference in the game of basketball
1290923 you grow up real fast if youre a coxswain in philadelphia
1290924 when youve got hundreds of boats on the schuylkill at the same time generally the coxswains are pretty sharp because they just have to be there are singles out there blind boats pairs theyve had to deal with a lot of stuff its like growing up on the autobahn in germany you really have to handle a vehicle
1290925 theres a lot of clubs hundreds of schools for some reason the culture this competitive in your face culture of philadelphia breeds decent coxswains even some of our worst coxswains are better than a lot of other places better coxswains
1290926 ive got six brothers and sisters my mother and father are each one of 10
1290927 growing up there were nine coxswains in my house everyone always had an opinion everyone was always right everyone was always stubborn
1290928 ive never met someone from delaware county who was shy
1290929 you can put 10 people in a room from delaware county pennsylvania and youll have 15 conversations going
1290930 last years boat was a younger boat marcus needed to be a little more of a motivator this is a little more mature group
1290931 my whole goal is to keep him happy thats it
1290932 no matter what it is if he wants something done you get it done in the boat out of the boat anything to keep him happy
1290933 being friends with the guys in the boat thats not important these guys dont want a friend they want to win ned gets more out of them neds got more talent long term hell be good but marcus has more experience
1290934 he doesnt want us to get relaxed and loosen up
1290935 at this level all these boats are really fast its the difference between going 55 miles per hour on a highway and going 100 miles per hour
1290936 for a coxswain its how you manage the race in a calm way its very similar to a jockey youve got to manage this huge horse sometimes youve got to hold this horse back sometimes youve got to let it out and youve got to be aware of where these other horses are
1290937 marcus enjoys running reading and political activism he enjoys 1980s rock techno and house music as well as classical and opera he lists opera singer maria callas as one of his favorite singers marcus reads music and plays the piano he is an avid reader marcus also enjoys kung fu movies he lists his favorite movies as my big fat greek wedding and kill bill vol 1 amp 2 marcus said he is not a hobby guy but is a creature of knowledge he says life is about doing new things so he always likes to try new things
1290938 if im in a bad mood put maria callas on and im in a good mood
1290939 my dads a union roofer my moms a schoolteacher she teaches at drexel hill middle school now she went back to school when i was at temple she went to temple
1290940 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1290941 i go to bible study just like he does every week
1290942 for me not to be able to forgive him then id just be wasting my time going to bible study
1290943 india needs more political will and needs to strengthen its healthcare delivery to the poorest of the poor who are not being reached

1290945 it felt really good to get back out there with the guys and to test the waters out so to speak
1290946 when you get an injury as a rookie thats because of fatigue in the legs you get that same exact injury at 35 its because youre old its the same injury i have known that i had six years ago hyperextended the knee
1290947 but since im nearly 35 now its because im older im going to go out and whatever i can give im going to give if i am not the same brian dawkins then well talk about being that brian dawkins if im not im not i anticipate being me
1290948 i only know one way to play that is full speed i have always done it that way
1290949 i put a whole lot of time in early really early
1290950 when i train i dont know what a 35 year old person is supposed to be doing all i know is i need to have my body right and these are things ive done in the past to get my body right
1290951 i dont want him to but our chemistry is great
1290952 ive been here with him for quite some time asante is a little different
1290953 once he gets on the field hell know how were going to try and play it and hell let me know how he wants to play it
1290954 when youre coming into a scheme there are some things where theres not a lot of wiggle room
1290955 those are the types of things asante is trying to learn on the run a little bit where is the wiggle room for me to be able to do what i do best
1290956 i would never ever want to be a liability to my teammates
1290957 i doubt very seriously that when that time comes that i will come back because i would have exhausted everything in this tank
1290958 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
1290959 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1290960 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1290961 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1290962 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl expletive him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1290963 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things some things im embarrassed to talk about
1290964 but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1290965 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1290966 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1290967 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse
1290968 some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1290969 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1290970 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1290971 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1290972 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont say everything is ok if it isnt
1290973 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1290974 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1290975 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1290976 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally
1290977 i think that was just part of me trying to identify myself
1290978 ive always felt like i was different i feel like im an abstract person and i still wonder who shawn andrews is thats why you always see me joking around being around people and singing activates my fun side
1290979 at the end of the day this doesnt take away from my fun side but it has for the time being
1290980 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1290981 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1290982 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1290983 moved forward under the assumption the event was no longer on
1290984 we wish it hadnt happened were certainly sorry it did happen and were going to work with them to find a solution to make things right
1290985 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
1290986 we will remain vigilant and will continue to take appropriate actions individually and collectively in order to secure stability and growth in our economies and globally
1290987 the world economy continues to face uncertainty and downside risks persist
1290988 elevated commodity prices especially of oil and food pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide have serious implications for the most vulnerable and may increase global inflationary pressure
1290989 we dont want to misdiagnose the problem and if you look at the problem i think its pretty clear we have not had an increase in production capacity in oil for the last 10 years
1290990 the world is a great mirror it reflects back to you what you are if you are loving if you are friendly if you are helpful the world will prove loving and friendly and helpful to you the world is what you are
1290991 happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but you let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is
1290992 its definitely fair we expect to win every game every year and when we dont its obviously a disappointment
1290993 if we didnt have 110 000 fans week in and week out not expecting us to do that we wouldnt be the program where were at
1290994 the slider was 89 91 m p h in 2006 and it took an unbelievable dive
1290995 now the slider is 83 86 but the movement is still good
1290996 how could such experienced pilots get lost how could all the compasses be wrong
1290997 former tbm pilots that we questioned express the opinion that the crew of an avenger attempting to ditch at night in a heavy sea would almost certainly not survive the crash and this we feel was the case with flight 19 the aircraft most probably broke up on impact and those crewmen who might have survived the crash would not have lasted long in cool water
1290998 reported to the coast guard that their freighter ran into a strong odor 15 miles off cape san antonia the western tip of cuba just before dawn on february 3
1290999 floating somewhere over the horizon her crew dead and her cargo blazing
1291000 during the preceding years three t 2s had split in half
1291001 theories ranged from mutiny at sea to a boiler explosion which carried away the radio shack and prevented any distress call
1291002 we confidently and without any hesitation often go to sea and work in that area
1291003 you can come up with hundreds of possibilities and elaborate on all of them and then come up with hundreds more to dispute the original ones
1291004 thunderstorms can also generate severe electrical storms sufficient to foul up communication systems
1291005 these small hybrid type storm systems arise very quickly especially over the gulf stream they are several miles in diameter last a few minutes or a few seconds and then vanish but they stir up giant waves and you have chaotic seas coming from all directions these storms can be devastating
1291006 peppered by staccato bolts of lightning and smelled the metallic odor of spent electricity as they hit the water then frightened by ball lightning running off the yards
1291007 weather within the triangle where warm tropical breezes meet cold air masses from the arctic is notoriously unpredictable
1291008 you can get a perfectly good weather pattern as far as the big weather maps go then go out there on what begins as a fine day and suddenly get hit by a 75 knot squall they are localized and build up on the spot but they are violent indeed
1291009 when it collides with strong northeast winds extremely stiff seas build up just as in an inlet when the tide is ebbing against an incoming sea
1291010 the seas out there can be just indescribable the waves break and you get a vertical wall of water from 30 to 40 feet high coming down on you unless a boat can take complete submergence in a large breaking sea she can not live
1291011 we have passed over the area hundreds of times and never noticed any unusual magnetic disturbances
1291012 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything were going for it thats what every move is based on
1291013 part of the reason im real pumped up about this season is finally we have a real healthy donovan mcnabb who looks great out there
1291014 i think andy reid and the personnel people have done a great job of retooling the defense with young fast players to go along with the veteran mix we have were much more athletic on offense
1291015 weve had the best quarterback in the nfc for quite a while thats not the case when hes not 100 percent or not there when hes healthy we have a terrific record
1291016 adapt to where things are at you try to be fair and do contracts when they make sense for the team youre trying to spread it out the best you can so you have the best possible roster
1291017 i think you want every player to be happy especially a professional like brian hes great one of my favorites you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out hopefully this will play out well
1291018 i will say that im very hopeful that lito will have a terrific season hell show us and the league that hes back to the old lito that hes healthy that hes got tremendous playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa
1291019 other players get reps and improve because thats the game of football youve got to prepare hes been hurt before so weve had to prepare anyway any time a player misses the work thats being done and the bonding with teammates even though hes a veteran and a very good player it disappoints me
1291020 wherever ive been we had exceptional returners and there was no need for me back there
1291021 ive always been the next guy in line its a good thing those guys never got hurt but i never got a chance
1291022 coming here i knew there wasnt an established guy back there
1291023 i try to relate it to running the ball in the open field but you cant its not the same thing theres really not enough time to start and stop you have to make a decision and go with it
1291024 one thing we were questioning there was whether or not he would able to break off the tackles and hes shown during some live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles
1291025 i havent talked to brett favre and i really havent followed it that close to be honest with you i try not to look at too much of the news im too busy right now
1291026 ehmm gue tau pasti gara2 loe naek motor trus kan kena angin nah sebenernya badan loe udah berisi cuma karena tiap hari kena angin karena naek motor makanya tuh badan kekikis abis d
1291027 i dont see how they are able to proceed with the case but my legal team suggested that we should come prepared for the worst
1291028 we have gone on the ground we have been meeting the mps including those in sabah and sarawak
1291029 we will have a more transparent economic programme procurement policies contracts which will be more attractive to foreign investors
1291030 the new economic agenda should be transparent the affirmative action programme must be based on need not on race
1291031 it should not be abused to help a few rich malays
1291032 assuming things are free and fair i shouldnt have any problems

1291039 its riquelme man itll always be riquelme heinze jumps up like rudolf nureyev beautiful stabs it home but its riquelme man it looks impossible like pouring a pint of beer into a shot glass not for riquelme magic
1291040 the rhapsody of football continues even when theyre penalties theyre painted with a beautiful stroke of genius its framed beautifully by the goal and the picasso of modern football that sees things in a different dimension to the mere humans he lives not in the tactical book not in anything that is painted from a to b riquelme doesnt live there dont look for him with the simplicity of football because hes an expressionist even on his penalty kicks

1291067 this is twilight zone football again man theres all sorts of calamity mistakes going on in both penalty boxes
1291068 lets remember this racing team have got fangs in their heads

1291082 it wouldnt get any more exciting here now if elvis himself showed up in a matadors outfit
1291083 i know how to kill you so there is no physical evidence
1291084 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1291085 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1291086 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1291087 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1291088 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
1291089 its private its between us and its not a big deal
1291090 i think we both got through the week alright id be ok with it if it just died with mini camp here i dont want it to continue through training camp i think its done a little offseason fun
1291091 the guys and girls that come to kalgoorlie to study at the school of mines actually have a better stickiness to the industry
1291092 they stay in the industry longer than say guys who are trained in perth because they often go and work in a mining town after they get a graduate degree and think its not their kettle of fish
1291093 lets say for every two geologists that you get out of perth maybe one of them sticks in the industry for 10 years but for kalgoorlie out of every two graduates maybe one and a half or two remain in the industry for that long
1291094 the additional cost for training a geologist in kalgoorlie is inconsequential when you consider what value we can add
1291095 it appears cheaper in perth but overwhelmingly kalgoorlie grads are the ones that last
1291096 if you cant live here youll never survive in the industry
1291097 we have a digger attitude here its about making things happen
1291098 the review recommends industry provide government with a more accurate measure of rehabilitation and mine closure costs in accordance with accepted accounting standards
1291099 this would bring western australia into line with other australian jurisdictions
1291100 a new bond estimation tool will be developed to help companies produce a more consistent and accurate estimation of these costs which must be paid before a project begins
1291101 unlike the current bond calculation system the tool will take into account cost factors such as increases in the consumer price index the cost of mobilising equipment over long distances and post closure monitoring
1291102 the review also recommends providing more clarity to industry on mine closure requirements through amendments to regulations and the creation of new supporting guidelines
1291103 bonds for exploration will only apply to proposed higher risk mineral exploration activity which will streamline approvals and reduce administration costs for industry and government
1291104 although cme had given in principle support for the development of an alternative bond calculation methodology final support for the new methodology would depend on it addressing the needs of industry and providing a clear environmental benefit
1291105 god has a plan or what doesnt kill you makes you stronger

1291108 mongolians are just coming to terms with the fact that the country is going to be a very important raw materials supplier to the global economy for a very long period of time
1291109 they are just taking the requisite amount of time in a democratic way to determine how they are going to handle it
1291110 its oyu tolgoi a very large project and it takes time to sort it out but the prime minister of mongolia has recently enjoyed an overwhelming majority in the government
1291111 we think weve made an enormous amount of progress in developing a win win situation for the mongolian people for foreign investors and for the perception of investment in mongolia
1291112 we see very significant uranium potential in the northern part of the district

1291122 its clearer than ever that one of the biggest issues our state and country faces is meeting our energy needs technological solutions like this plant at benwood will lead to more environmentally friendly ways to use our coal and hold the key to americas energy security
1291123 i am committed to making west virginia the leader in clean coal technology and the construction of clean coal power and fuel liquefaction plants we have the resources and expertise to realise our goal
1291124 we are in the midst of a serious energy crisis in america today with this project and others in the works west virginia is announcing to the world that were not waiting around anymore
1291125 were getting started with a ctl plant that will create jobs meet modern environmental standards and develop our most abundant domestic resource coal this plant will help put our state and our country on the path to energy security and greater economic growth

1291132 i honestly havent seen him enough yet to say much about him accurately
1291133 i like coach sidney lowe and the atmosphere there a lot
1291134 state got him and won him before a lot of people knew about him
1291135 if he does that he is going to be one of the top 25 players in the country before he is done
1291136 he does everything great now except play defense he is a good defender but not a great one
1291137 but as far as quickness skills shooting passing he is great and hed just as soon make a great pass as score himself
1291138 i was like come on man i gotta be singing about someones fiery sex for a year and half
1291139 its a bold title yknow were getting old and were trying to make people think we have still have the sex drive that we did
1291140 i think a lot of people expect a certain element of sex to our music and theres a tinge of sex throughout the record but this is the most blatant
1291141 the tour is bigger than anything the band have done before they will be on the road for more than a year possibly pushing 18 months
1291142 the dates could easily run into three figures and will take them around the world it is on the kind of scale you would expect from the rolling stones
1291143 the fellas who have hatched the plan are very proud and excited
1291144 were going to start recording in september and hopefully have the album out in january or february
1291145 we wrote a lot of colour it in four years ago so we dont want the new record to sound like that this one is less straight forward but still spirited
1291146 we havent been doing many gigs recently weve just been writing pretty solidly
1291147 i wasnt even too keen on doing this one but the boys get really bored so were doing a couple im just looking forward to getting the new record finished and then trying to persuade everyone that the newer songs are better than the old ones
1291148 we have developed a strategic relationship with newtec over the years and have found its products to be both innovative and highly reliable
1291149 for this particular project newtecs tellinet software platform has been integrated into our skyarcs product line and it has already demonstrated significant improvement in the internet experience of the users through increased browsing speed and network security
1291150 tellinet is a versatile product that uses very advanced technologies to enhance ip applications over satellite and increase bandwidth efficiency we are very pleased that as a result of our strategic partnership with nd satcom and the fact that tellinet is a superior acceleration software product our technology has been selected for delivering improved network services to bundeswehr
1291151 the installation of fujitsu recycling equipment has allowed bes to reinforce the politics of cash recirculation and compliance with the present guidelines regarding the certification of bank notes the platform of remote equipment monitoring creates additional value for bes because it is an innovative solution and a basic asset for the efficient management of such equipment
1291152 this project is very important to fujitsu which already has a 20 year old history in the introduction of new technologies in the top portuguese financial institutions this solution of cash management represented an additional challenge because it involved the local development of monitoring and resource agility tools that will be exported now to spain and italy
1291153 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1291154 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1291155 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1291156 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1291157 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out
1291158 critical to this however is user acceptance and that will mean the radical transformation of traditional mindsets in a number of business areas not least human resources and the way employees interact the answer be prepared

1291221 het is stuitend en belachelijk dat we nu ook al bij het vrouwenvoetbal met dit soort problemen worden geconfronteerd

1291228 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
1291229 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently

1291235 speaking to him yesterday i believe he is still a fantastic batter one of the best batters weve got in this country
1291236 michael says he wants to score runs for yorkshire and hell go back into county cricket without any stresses or strains and hell score as many runs as he can and im sure michael will be back in this england team
1291237 they are huge boots ive got to try and fill but ill give it the best possible i can give it
1291238 ill always respect the job michael has done and the jobs my predecessors have done and i will always look for advice i am fresh into this captaincy and ill need some advice and help along the way
1291239 i spoke to michael at great lengths and one of the most exciting things is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad
1291240 they basically said were right behind you and well support you once youve got the support from the lads around you who youre with all the time theres nothing more you can ask for
1291241 we did discuss his batting but it was a short discussion because we know what his capabilities are

1291247 ravi has earned the right to play he didnt perform as well as he would have liked in sri lanka maybe it was a wake up call for him
1291248 i think it was a bit of a reality check regarding just how tough cricket can be but he has gone back to essex this summer and you cant argue with anything he has done
1291249 he is one of the leading first class run scorers this season so he demands to be picked
1291250 he also got a double hundred in a one day game with leicestershire not many people have done that not even the great graham gooch
1291251 when i saw ravi as a youngster at 18 he was the most talented youngster ive ever seen
1291252 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1291253 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1291254 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1291255 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1291256 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1291257 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide

1291261 the abc loan has been of great concern to qpr fans and has been a noose around the neck of this football club for far too long
1291262 i am delighted that we have now made arrangements to put this saga to an end
1291263 building for the future is what is important to me and the rest of the qpr board however with certain issues it is always necessary to deal with elements from the past and today we have done this
1291264 this once again highlights our commitment to this football club and now i am looking forward to working on the continued growth of queens park rangers both as a club and as a brand
1291265 the company is required to repay an existing loan of 10m to abc on or before the 31 7 08 abc currently has an option over the loftus road stadium which becomes exercisable if the company fails to repay the loan in full by 31 7 08 the company requires financing in order to repay the loan the company has sought to secure this financing from various financial institutions but has been unable to do so owing to conditions and requirements of those institutions as a result amulya has agreed to advance a loan of 10m to the company in order to allow the company to repay the loan by 31 7 08 and thereby avoid the possibility of abc exercising their option and acquiring the title to the stadium however as a condition to advancing the loan amulya requires the company to enter into the option the option is on substantially similar terms to the abc option it grants amulya an option to buy the stadium for 10m which is exercisable in the event the company fails to repay amulya when the loan is due the term of the amulya loan is two years the rate is 8 50 compared with abcs 10 amulya property limited is a company that both briatore and amit bhatia are connected with and also happens to share its name with a large indian property company
1291266 sir alex is determined he will not let ronaldo go now if only on principle

1291269 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1291270 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook

1291272 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1291273 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1291274 i had the time of my life at those games winning the gold medal was one of the highlights of my career
1291275 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1291276 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1291277 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
1291278 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience

1291383 el problema social creado por las acciones de escobar y su aspiraci n pol tica sumado al empuje de la guerrilla y a la necesidad de suplir las deficiencias de seguridad inherentes al estado nos llev a muchos de distintas clases sociales y econ micas a enfrentar el reto de la guerra y de la descomposici n social el narcotr fico no era la meta pero hab a que conocerlo a fondo para tratarlo pues las farc y las autodefensas comenzaban a nutrirse de esa fuente

1291395 un trabajo que busca realizarse con cierta precariedad de medios en una consciente huida de la opulencia de la sociedad contempor nea tan propicia a reclamar obras singulares de arquitectos del mundo medi tico

1291397 es un edificio simple sin un gesto de m s con una geometr a espartana remodelado con materiales sencillos utilizando negro blanco y gris en su mobiliario con una falta absoluta de terminaciones una obra casi incorp rea apenas un reflejo en el paisaje
1291398 al mismo tiempo que ganamos la bienal germ n del solo el flamante premio nacional de arquitectura dijo que la vivienda social no era arquitectura eso expresa la esquizofrenia de esta profesi n
1291399 hay un l mite en la disciplina que est exactamente al otro lado en vez de ir a la ltima palabra ir a la primera
1291400 si en algo uno puede tener algo interesante que decir es en la escasez porque todos los otros trabajan en la abundancia
1291401 es que est en el centro de iquique una familia que no ha roto redes sociales ni redes laborales puede invertir en su casa el suelo es tremendamente incidente en una pol tica de la vivienda para que sta pueda ser vista como una inversi n y no como un gasto
1291402 para que una vivienda sea vista como una inversi n
1291403 tiene que ocurrir lo que nos pasa a todos cuando nos compramos una casa que cada d a valga m s y en las viviendas sociales eso no ocurre y el factor n mero uno para que una vivienda se valorice en el tiempo es su localizaci n una familia independientemente de su condici n social necesita estar lo m s cerca posible de la red de oportunidades que est presente en los barrios residenciales bien ubicados pero no en la periferia pobre
1291404 todos estamos bien porque vivimos en comunidad nos conocemos sabemos lo que hace cada uno de nosotros antes en la quinta monroy est bamos distribuidos no logr bamos vernos seguido
1291405 qu alternativa tengo cemento en vez de madera no se van a poder sentar y el cemento no se puede levantar para reparar las grietas pasto se filtra madera lisa se tuerce y no alcanza la plata qu queda zinc se calienta y no se puede pisar
1291406 hace unos a os est bamos en lucha nuestra estrategia era de confrontaci n directa y la movilizaci n callejera as pudimos frenar el alca acuerdo de libre comercio de las am ricas pero lo que est pasando ahora es muy raro muy novedoso y nos oblig a cambiar nuestra cabeza fue muy dif cil procesarlo qu quer s que te diga a veces me siento un poco confundido ahora del otro lado s lo tenemos amigos
1291407 yo s lo quer a escaparme de la granja y ped trabajo en una f brica de campinhas fue ah donde descubr un mundo nuevo con compa eros que hablaban de reivindicaciones sociales desde el primer d a supe que se era mi lugar
1291408 no quedan dudas de que ahora tenemos mucha m s participaci n social el somos mercosur ha creado un espacio muy importante para las organizaciones de la sociedad civil de la regi n
1291409 pero esa voluntad pol tica choca con el modelo decisorio del bloque que es muy centralizado y donde todo tiene que ser decidido por los presidentes si no se cambia ese esquema vamos a tener m s fracasos que aciertos
1291410 ahora hay m s armon a y a diferencia de los 90 hoy no necesitamos hacer tanto ruido porque la sociedad civil y los gobiernos est n involucrados en un mismo proceso ya no estamos en veredas separadas
1291411 estamos frente a un movimiento de cambio de sectores neoliberales a sectores progresistas de centroizquierda es una novedad que no debemos dejar pasar pero tambi n sabemos que esta oportunidad se puede convertir en una decepci n si la dimensi n de las demandas sociales no es atendida
1291412 en ning n lado se est dando tanta sinton a entre gobiernos y sociedad como en am rica latina ahora son m s f ciles el di logo y la participaci n y esto abre posibilidades efectivas de modificar el proceso de concentraci n de la riqueza pero el riesgo de nuestros pa ses es la muerte de la sociedad civil porque los gobiernos pasan pero las demandas quedan
1291413 esa noche tuve sentimientos de conquista y una gran sensaci n de esperanza por participar con mis compa eros en la lucha del cambio social y la reforma agraria
1291414 vemos con mucha esperanza la integraci n de los movimientos sociales los pueblos y los campesinos de am rica del sur aunque falta mucho para alcanzarla la lucha no ha terminado
1291415 estamos convencidos del proceso revolucionario que estamos construyendo m s all de las complicaciones porque a diferencia de otras revoluciones que fueron a plomo limpio y sustituyendo unos cuadros por otros la nuestra es m s larga porque es pac fica hasta donde nos dejen y democr tica en su esencia
1291416 cuando nos acusan de ser oficialistas yo me r o porque ste es nuestro gobierno pertenecemos a esta revoluci n
1291417 soy la tercera generaci n de comunistas en mi familia somos todos guerrinchas
1291418 hab a mucho temor en algunas organizaciones sociales porque pensaban que ser a un foro chavista pero respetamos la regla de oro fue un espacio de los movimientos sociales y fue todo un xito con m s de 90 000 personas que participaron en 1 800 actividades
1291419 estamos frente a la construcci n de sujetos aut nomos y de una nueva ciudadan a pero tambi n dentro de una pol tica clientelar promovida por el estado nos encontramos en un proceso sistem tico de colonizaci n de la sociedad desde un gobierno que maneja muchos recursos y establece relaciones verticales y tambi n frente a una etapa de organizaci n popular de sectores que se apropian de lo p blico para iniciar su participaci n en la toma de decisiones por suerte la realidad venezolana es muy din mica
1291420 con la debacle de los partidos tradicionales venezolanos en los 80 se empieza a hablar de democracia de ciudadanos pero estos ciudadanos proven an de sectores medios altos esto es lo que aqu se interpreta como sociedad civil mientras que los sectores populares no tienen ning n inter s en reivindicar para s ese concepto
1291421 en venezuela tuvimos mucha inversi n en materia de vivienda de corte social pero tambi n muchas denuncias de corrupci n desv os de fondos aunque por otro lado tambi n vemos marchas de campesinos de cooperativas de mujeres que se est n organizando para reclamar y eso se ha dado en este proceso
1291422 ser mejor que nos reunamos en el caracas hilton despu s de las seis de la tarde ya es peligrosa la ciudad
1291423 nos preocupa la relaci n que se da entre gobierno y organizaciones sociales pero son las circunstancias que nos ha tocado vivir porque el chavismo lleg al poder sin estructura y tuvo que recurrir al pueblo para gestionar eso es bueno aunque tambi n presenta un problema serio de autonom a que antes se daba con los partidos y ahora llega directamente desde el estado
1291424 antes ramos el movimiento contra el alca y el tlc pero con la intenci n de ya no ser s lo negativos cambiamos a este otro nombre para estudiar propuestas que puedan cambiar el modelo neoliberal
1291425 la gente empez a darse cuenta de lo que significaban la transnacionalizaci n la privatizaci n y la p rdida de nuestros recursos naturales el alca mostr su rostro y nunca m s fue bien visto en bolivia
1291426 queremos una integraci n social de los pueblos y sabemos que podemos lograrla pero tenemos que seguir atentos porque es cierto que los gobiernos han cambiado su discurso y hoy acceden a todo lo que exigen los movimientos sociales pero todo eso puede quedar en palabras
1291427 decidimos involucrarnos en este gobierno porque nos parec a que interpreta y encarna los reclamos de los movimientos sociales desde una perspectiva de cambio
1291428 es un orgullo estar ac porque sabemos que podemos ayudar mucho a los movimiento sociales aunque algunos te hacen sentir un funcionario de segunda porque ven s de la militancia social
1291429 tenemos que apoyar a este gobierno porque es un gobierno en disputa va hacia la transici n hacia un modelo alternativo y necesita la fortaleza de los movimientos sociales para poder enderezar el rumbo para poder romper con el neoliberalismo y para que en ese camino no triunfen las expresiones de la vieja pol tica que tambi n se incorporan al oficialismo
1291430 nosotros ya percib amos que hab a un cambio una cumbre con kirchner lula ch vez y tabar era muy distinta a todas las que hab amos tenido antes porque estos presidentes retoman muchas de nuestras consignas y tenemos que apoyarlos
1291431 el presidente hugo ch vez me dijo yo hubiese nacionalizado en seis o siete a os y t lo has hecho en cien d as
1291432 est bien han nacionalizado pero d game una cosa est garantizado el abastecimiento
1291433 se ampliar el gasoducto a la argentina de 7 7 millones c bicos a 20 7 millones c bicos adicionales
1291434 whilst the current demand for games that can be played on the iphone is giving the mobile gaming industry a much needed boost there are a number of issues that will need to be addressed by games developers
1291435 they need to overcome technical challenges to deliver more enticing games to a wider audience of gamers and they need to do this fast
1291436 so whilst in the short term the iphone is boosting sales of mobile games the favour wont be returned until the iphone can support a major blockbuster title or two
1291437 basta ya de secuestros y desapariciones ven haz algo di algo para que no te toque a ti
1291438 nos duele la maldad de los malos pero m s nos duele la indiferencia de los buenos
1291439 me qued unos d as en medell n porque me rogaron que no fuera por all ya iban cinco desaparecidos y nadie quer a otro
1291440 esta ni a ha soportado esas pesadillas deber a haberse muerto pero aqu est haciendo el caldito
1291441 es el sentimiento de que tenemos lo necesario para ser viables y sin embargo vivimos frustraci n tras frustraci n
1291442 el pr ximo presidente del per tiene como base de votaci n espont nea a s lo la quinta parte del pa s esto demuestra que el sistema de representaci n no est funcionando
1291443 una de las razones fundamentales de la desmoralizaci n de la sociedad peruana la impunidad de los corruptos alan garc a nos propone que creamos en lo que dice y nos olvidemos de lo que hizo que los historiadores nos ocupemos de su pasado y que volvamos al borr n y cuenta nueva el secreto de la futura felicidad de los peruanos
1291444 con alan garc a no estamos ante una persona equivocada pol ticamente que tiene malas f rmulas sino ante alguien que no puede controlar su personalidad hay quienes piensan que es c nico yo creo que no cuando miente el c nico sabe finalmente que su mentira no es cierta pero en garc a hay una disgregaci n cree que sus mentiras son verdad por cierto no es un loco en el sentido de inimputable es muy inteligente brillante en una serie de cosas pero entre la locura y la completa lucidez hay un abanico muy complejo y dif cil de definir encontraremos un garc a l cido en algunas cosas pero ciego en otras por ejemplo el tema tico es un punto ciego en su personalidad una contrapartida de este punto ciego moral es la necesidad de reafirmar su notoriedad a partir de medidas que pueden ser muy irresponsables cuando dej el gobierno el precio de la electricidad era de 50 centavos de d lar y el del gal n de gasolina de diez centavos el precio internacional era mucho mayor por ejemplo de dos d lares en el caso de la gasolina por qu pudo hacerlo porque una empresa era electroper estatal y otra petroper tambi n estatal y l necesitaba proteger su ego magullado por los resultados de una p sima gesti n econ mica su necesidad personal de no quedar tan mal lo llev a devastar dos empresas estatales esto ha cambiado desde entonces hasta hoy ya es el pol tico responsable que muchos creen ver yo creo que no
1291445 si el apra ya hace eso muy h bilmente desde fuera del gobierno como podemos observar con su influencia en el poder judicial en el organismo electoral en los gobiernos descentralizados podemos imaginar lo que ser cuando tenga el poder va a convertir al estado en un bot n
1291446 a estas alturas alan garc a no me parece un animal ideol gico no tiene una propuesta consistente que pueda considerarse alternativa en el debate con humala lo m s radical que dijo fue que quer a renegociar los contratos con las empresas extranjeras para que el estado tuviera m s participaci n en las utilidades te parece distinto eso ya lo hab a dicho la candidata derechista lourdes flores

1291449 el trabajo de la universidad es excelente se forman muchas personas calificadas y hay muchas oportunidades de mostrar nuestros proyectos en congresos cient ficos y de crear cosas diferentes tenemos amigos y profesores muy entrenados con la tecnolog a siempre en la vanguardia siempre dispuestos para ayudar
1291450 el plus que tiene la universidad con respecto a otras que tambi n son de muy buen nivel es que en la nuestra adem s de aprender procuramos buscar innovaciones el criterio de la carrera de inform tica es siempre aprender innovando

1291452 sab amos que las empresas solas no iban a ser competitivas que la econom a del nordeste del brasil es una econom a perif rica dentro de un pa s perif rico como el brasil y que no pod amos insertarnos en el mundo si no junt bamos todos los esfuerzos la industria de la tecnolog a de la informaci n est asociada a parques con mucha historia como los de silicon valley boston singapur al cabo de seis a os todo indica que sali bien primero se fueron sumando las pymes y luego las grandes compa as multinacionales vieron que algo estaba ocurriendo aqu y no quisieron quedarse fuera
1291453 si el directorio concluye que la idea tiene m ritos para ser incubada hacemos un estudio m s profundo de mercado de viabilidad t cnica econ mica luego se analiza el perfil del emprendedor muchas veces la persona idealiza la idea que tiene pero uno ve que el proyecto no tiene perfil para hacer un buen emprendimiento el tercer an lisis que hacemos es t cnico ya existe un producto desarrollado una idea y por ltimo se hace un an lisis financiero una vez que queda claro que la idea puede funcionar la empresa est aprobada para incubaci n este proceso lleva entre tres y cuatro meses se es nuestro filtro inicial c e s a r se asocia al negocio provee su infraestructura f sica sus contactos su experiencia su rea de marketing su rea contable su rea jur dica etc tera es el socio mayoritario del proyecto y a medida que se van cumpliendo ciertas metas la participaci n del emprendedor en el proyecto va aumentando hasta que abandona c e s a r
1291454 un fracaso absoluto porque suponen la existencia de un capital de riesgo que no existe en lugar de ir a buscar directamente qu necesita el mercado que es lo que hacemos nosotros

1291465 as of now even those families earning p20 000 a month can hardly make ends meet how in the world can mrs arroyo label those earning p6 700 and up rich
1291466 applying president arroyos sona statement to actual data it would appear that 4 3 of households consume 90 of residential electricity using meralcos own definition of rich customers at 1 000 kwh and up this would mean that a mere 1 of households consume 90 of residential electricity either way mrs arroyos statement flies in the face of reality and is a big statistical farce
1291467 in fact industry figures would show that the power consumed by upper income homes consuming at least 500kwh per month is only 9 55 of total power consumed thus the only way to explain the presidents speech is that her speechwriter made a mistake in placing the decimal point on electricity consumed by the rich it should have been nine percent not ninety
1291468 given the data that we have gathered so far it is clear as day that it is the ordinary consumer more than 70 of whom are poor will benefit from the removal of vat on oil and power for a president who describes herself as an economist this manipulation of statistics to justify an unjust and oppressive tax like the vat brings her to a new low this would make her not only a fake president but a fake economist as well

1291474 all of these issues will be threshed out where it is now the supreme court so the constitutionality validity whether that is binding or not we will leave this to the sc dahil doon yung final arbiter
1291475 the moa is now with supreme court it will undergo close scrutiny as to validity and constitutionality we will await the sc to make that determination

1291489 not only that during my research ive had people from other areas of the uk wanting to know more about our project so they can see about doing something similar in their area
1291490 green dog walkers will receive clear instructions to never confront another dog walker in an antagonistic manner the friendliness and even creative humour of the project will be the tone at all times

1291564 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems
1291565 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
1291566 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
1291567 on june 4 1996 an unmanned ariane 5 rocket launched by the european space agency exploded just forty seconds after its lift off from kourou french guiana ariane explosion the rocket was on its first voyage after a decade of development costing 7 billion the destroyed rocket and its cargo were valued at 500 million a board of inquiry investigated the causes of the explosion and in two weeks issued a report it turned out that the cause of the failure was a software error in the inertial reference system specifically a 64 bit floating point number relating to the horizontal velocity of the rocket with respect to the platform was converted to a 16 bit signed integer the number was larger than 32 767 the largest integer storeable in a 16 bit signed integer and thus the conversion failed

1291581 these fundamentals represent solid opportunities and a sound plan for growth with potential for good results over the near and long term

1291589 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters

1291595 my government send me here to underscore that the us attaches equal importance to issues of democracy and human rights
1291596 we have been extremely impressed with the progress this country has made over the past 17 years
1291597 but there is concern in washington which is echoed here too that the political space is being closed
1291598 as anyone can see in the last 17 years the government has had an unwavering stance on the need to build a democratic country
1291599 democracy is the express will of the ethiopian people and there is no alternative to it the fact that private electronic media has become operational since 2005 indicates that the space is not shrinking
1291600 i am very pleased with the vision skills and in depth experience that the new senior management core team brings to address the significant opportunities available to our company to quickly move through final project funding construction and production

1291603 at first only two doctors came and i took them to my home area of kifamba in rakai district where they treated sick people
1291604 we have a programme in that area called kifamba zukuka which in english means wake up kifamba
1291605 over the years many more doctors and health workers decided to join the team these are people who have chosen to spend their annual leave visiting uganda and treating the sick free of charge providing free medicine
1291606 but of course i dont take them to my birthplace only they have since been to so many other places in uganda including kalangala kira town mukono and a few districts in western uganda
1291607 they also have a special affinity for africa as their continent of origin they know that somewhere in africa are real kinsmen and descendants of their great great grandparents from whom their fore fathers were forcefully and painfully separated by the slave traders
1291608 it has served as an eye opener to us leaders that we have got to do something
1291609 our people are sick and we have got to improve medical care
1291610 land is still our problem we have so far failed to find the land to begin construction of the hospital
1291611 even if some of them missed seeing the doctors there are many others who have done so and benefited and to me this is very good our american friends have now come to get a better idea how big our problem is and for sure they will provide more help
1291612 we have made sure that there is a dispensary in every sub county and we have posted a doctor at butenga health centre four
1291613 but the problem is that it is difficult to keep doctors in our health facilities for long they tend to leave for greener pastures
1291614 while services activity fell at a slower rate during july the risks to future trends in the sector remained clearly skewed to the downside
1291615 the record contraction in new business severe cost pressures and deteriorating sentiment all point to the continuation of difficult times ahead
1291616 the data just confirm that the economy has pretty much ground to a halt going into the third quarter

1291654 on the back of splendid results for 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 despite fierce competition in many markets we are elated that zain continues its excellent performance in the first half of 2008 highlighted by crossing the 50 million customer milestone these impressive results reflect the exceptional operational efficiencies in a company that is investing heavily and rapidly expanding across two continents
1291655 we have started to reap the rewards of our recent large investments particularly in iraq nigeria and sudan with these 3 countries now serving more than half of zains 50 million customers and we expect similar rewards when our operations in saudi arabia and ghana commence commercial operations
1291656 we look keenly forward to launching our modern network and commercial offerings in the kingdom promising to offer the saudi community world class telecom services we are confident that our investment in the kingdom will reap rewards for all our stakeholders
1291657 one networks preferential offerings removing borders and high roaming charges have been warmly welcomed and we expect it will be the catalyst for further growth in customer acquisition as we soon plan to link the 2 continents
1291658 zain aspires to be a top ten global telecom company by 2011 and increasing the companys capital will provide the company with the liquidity necessary to continue its ambitious expansion strategy while reducing the borrowing costs of the companys operations and increasing shareholder value in the long term

1291667 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1291668 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1291669 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
1291670 its impossible to put a 20 goals prediction on any player but what we know is that if we give him a couple of chances he will score goals

1291672 he has shown in pre season and in other games last season that not only can he score he can score two or three in a game thats an asset any team needs
1291673 hes got an instinct and a composure in front of goal he likes the challenge of the premier league and of coming up against defenders so i think the league games will bring even more out of him

1291688 demand from power plants and a change in the crude mix for processing at koyali to produce more gasoline and diesel would bring down naphtha production for august and september
1291689 hopefully by end of august we will start the pilot project
1291690 this is a win win situation at a time when airlines around the world are retrenching employees to cope with the skyrocketing fuel price

1291696 it has been a policy in this country for quite a number of employers to keep the passports for safety reasons
1291697 we view this seriously unless and until we maintain an appearance that we are a conducive place to do such business our conditions of work and employment are meeting up to international standards then we might lose out in the long run

1291750 its about time we are able to adequately exhibit art on line the basic jpg is not a great representation of a painting weve worked long and hard to find a suitable technology to properly present paintings and we believe weve found the perfect answer
1291751 it is important that jpgs are able to be represented in a manner and fashion that allows users to inspect the work at close range and at multiple angles it is also extremely important that the user experience appears seamless that the work can be viewed through a standard browser utilizing commonplace technologies weve been able to achieve both objectives no extraordinary applications or downloads are required just the standard flash enabled browser which is basically any and all of them
1291752 but the technology is only a platform to represent the content

1291792 i am going to predict once again that we will have a sea change i am really bullish honestly if i was going to start a linux business today it would be something on the desktop or a mobile device
1291793 the reason is that a laptop computer is going to be a couple of hundred bucks in a couple of years you are going to have fully functional laptops that are incredibly cheap intel and amd are building systems on a chip that is reducing the cost of building these kind of devices the highest cost items on these things is memory and storage so if you look at the world in the future of the 200 laptop linux is the only game in town
1291794 early successes will push microsoft to price compete but its not just the price that is going to make the difference but the fact that with linux you can tailor the experience for woman over 40 in asia for example
1291795 i think rather than embracing openness on the desktop side they will do the opposite they will retrench they will do anything to protect that microsoft office cash cow i mean that is their big monopoly in terms of really displaying monopoly price characteristics jesus that is an expensive suite of products
1291796 for me the biggest loser here is microsoft that is just a kick in the teeth for them i would not want to be in the windows mobile sales group now

1291798 it is going to be tough fight i think the android guys are going to come out with some really good handsets at christmas next year and i think google is extremely good at attracting new developers they have as buzz about them and a track record of developing killer development tools
1291799 the assumed reason for google to develop android is to keep that mobile computing world as open as possible so that companies like google can provide services paid search music downloads you name it and not have to go through an os vendor or a carrier nokia definitely has the same ambitions they want to be similar to apple when it comes to distributing music and entertainment and all these mobile vendors see that future and they all want to be there
1291800 well we support the kernel development effort and that is the one thing that all these developments have in common they all use the linux kernel so to the extent that we can provide forums to allow the groups to collaborate on technical issues at the core of their technology then we are out to do that as well as legal issues we have a forum for council from all these companies to come together to discuss the legal issues which has been a pretty popular forum for a lot of companies within the mobile linux and mobile industry in general
1291801 they seem to get some kind of bye you ever noticed that
1291802 but then the reality is that they just make killer products no one can argue that the iphone or the mac desktop experience is not a great experience

1291817 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1291818 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1291819 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1291820 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1291821 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets

1291844 plaintiffs purchased at an inflated price and were also damaged by the funds failure to properly redeem the shares of the fund investors at a price representing the correct net asset value
1291845 these statements were materially false or misleading because the fund in fact employed a strategy of investing in highly risky securities that were illiquid or otherwise became difficult to value

1292007 the professional development session worked out even better than we imagined each industry partner met three to five confident and articulate young individuals and the mot scholars responded to the challenge of selling themselves in only five minutes very well
1292008 the panel gave brilliant insights on tips for success in interviews the work environment and how to engage in the process of developing as a whole person and the comments during the debrief proved that everyone surprised themselves that is a sure sign that the process sparked something new
1292009 the professional development session was informative engaging and challenging the format and structure was a welcome variation of the standard development session
1292010 the experiences shared by the panel and tips for improvement and success were most definitely beneficial to scholars and industry representatives alike the fact that the panel came from various but relevant areas of expertise made for a well rounded and insightful training session
1292011 the speed interviews tested skills such as thinking on your feet and using a small amount of time efficiently unlike a regular interview where there is a certain amount of flexibility in terms of time and subject matter a five minute interview requires that you show the best of you to the interviewer from the moment you greeted them to the time the bell rang
1292012 i think it was an excellent session it allowed caymanians to be exposed to a higher level of professionalism in terms of interviewing and networking
1292013 i think government made an excellent move to capture this generation for the future in building upon caymanian heritage within the tourism sector

1292032 the launch of our customer newsletter is another exciting initiative that has materialised from our 25th anniversary celebration
1292033 we trust that it will be of value to our customers and that by reading it they will gain a better understanding of our goals and future plans for the cayman islands
1292034 in developing the content for our newsletter we focused on topics that are useful and relevant to our customers
1292035 our main objective in creating the newsletter was to stay connected with our customers and continue to share important information about their water supply
1292036 our new turks and caicos net news website which was launched just a matter of weeks ago is already attracting some 1 000 visits daily and we expect this figure to increase ten fold within a relative short period of time
1292037 although the cayman net news website alone received over one million hits in one 24 hour period the day after hurricane ivan in 2004 these events are the exception rather than the rule and the day to day growth in normal traffic is very gratifying
1292038 what a great hotel which brings the true feeling of a cayman islands experience to the international visitor great hospitality and wonderful food at the marriott hotel
1292039 congratulations to walter regidor general manager and his entire team thank you for a wonderful stay
1292040 this is fantastic please thank all your colleagues for their generous support without this sort of support the foster home would not be able to provide the quality of care we do
1292041 for the 2008 09 rotary year our club has selected the eco weekends as it includes a successful positive result on youth education and environment all in one programme
1292042 we are pleased that rotary is able to be instrumental in shifting the eco weekend concept into a fully operational programme that will benefit youth and the cayman islands for years to come
1292043 this new partnership with the rotary club of grand cayman represents a substantial commitment to educate caymans youth one on one using hands on techniques giving them real life experiences
1292044 launching the eco weekends is going to have a great impact on the community as these youth apply their new knowledge
1292045 our textbooks came alive on this trip and allowed us to further appreciate our ecosystem from a participants perspective
1292046 only three weeks into their new year the rotary club of grand cayman has already shown their commitment to the theme make dreams real
1292047 the eco weekend students will gain information to make their textbooks come alive as well as be mentally equipped to make good decisions and share their new knowledge with their families and peers we see a bright future ahead
1292048 unfortunately our officers can find themselves in difficult situations which require them to use force however we do not tolerate the use of excessive force and officers are duty bound to respond appropriately to the situation
1292049 they were roughing him up in his neck and tackling him even with the handcuffs on
1292050 they had him smashed against the car and all of us were yelling at them to stop
1292051 they roughed up him bad they didnt go to the boy the right way they pushed him and they grabbed him back and then theyd push him again so he wasnt resisting arrest
1292052 it wasnt fair how they beat that child it was wrong
1292053 i was invited over and it was paid for by the cayman islands government i was speaking on constitutional changes and thats what i was doing i wasnt sunning myself up it was in my time and i havent taken any time off it was an official visit
1292054 the mps came at the invitation of the cayman islands leader of government business and the trip was funded by the cayman islands government no information about costs is available
1292055 there was a recruiter doing large scale open session interviews for bartending jobs in three different caribbean locations about a thousand people showed up for what was really only a handful of jobs
1292056 id work at bamboo from 4 00 pm till 2 00 am and then be up in time for my classes which began at 8 00 am and ran till 2 30 pm id have like a nine minute nap at home before heading out to work
1292057 two years ago i first began to think about the rollover
1292058 i can appreciate that this is a small island and the caymanians dont want to be dominated by expats but people like me are not asking to vote were not asking to run the country only to make a home here
1292059 but now because of the rollover instead of investing my hard earned savings here this island that is kicking me out i now have no choice but to take it back with me to canada
1292060 basically i lost all of my stuff the water was over the roof of my car and almost all my household things were destroyed
1292061 whereas i stayed here and helped rebuild the country helped the caymanians clean things up to bring the country back but i feel like i was punished for having stayed

1292080 ill tell you what i think i think the elite in foreign affairs have taken the lazy way forward what i would call very lazy lets go again the way we did three or four years ago and lets go for another vote the voters will accept it the voters will not accept it nor should they be given the insult of being asked to accept it that is lazy and foolish
1292081 no i am not talking about micheal martin because i genuinely feel he knows enough about polls he knows enough about going for elections as does anybody who has been elected so therefore i do not think that the thinking about this is coming directly from him i think it is coming from what we call the mandarins but i dont like to use the word the high ups in the civil service in brussels and back in ireland who say oh listen were a bother to everyone lets go again with another referendum
1292082 they listened to my moaning and my groaning and my upbeat and my downbeat as it went along but they were there for me and they worked like blacks

1292093 and if professor robert hazell is right in his suggestion that a country like spain could veto scottish independence then the nation states still have cards left to play

1292097 we as coaches certainly believe that playing on an international level with full sized indoor courts against other competitors from around the world helped our caymanian players to elevate their own standards and expectations of themselves and this is reflected in the awards that they achieved and the sense of self satisfaction and gratification that each player expressed
1292098 all of our players displayed great enthusiasm and appreciation for the opportunity to participate in an overseas program of this magnitude and the opportunity to meet and interact with other players from around the world
1292099 our current players are definitely looking forward to next years overseas camp while bearing in mind that despite the setbacks here in cayman the only way to make it to a higher level is to work harder
1292100 we as coaches feel that our players are prepared to do just that and this is something that we will continue to instill in each of them

1292141 falling commodity prices are certainly adding weight to the dollars recent gains but a degree of caution should probably be exercised before becoming too convinced that this is an established trend not least as the scope for rate cuts from the fed in the second half of the year remains a real possibility
1292142 however oil prices may now be moving into an established downward trend as inventories build demand particularly in the u s is tailing off and perhaps most significantly some are realizing that the speculative run higher for crude could be at an end

1292152 from a team perspective losing brad is a big blow for all of us
1292153 he is an outstanding super 14 player a good guy with great leadership qualities but we are not going to hold him back he could even be back in a few years to play for us
1292154 he is still young enough to return to us and become a very valuable member for the sharks
1292155 we are going to miss him and we all wish him well
1292156 i wouldnt consider another option in south africa the sharks is my home where i grew up but this is a unique opportunity as young guy to broaden my horizons
1292157 i want to emphasise the point that i am not turning my back on the sharks or springbok rugby this is a unique opportunity for me as a young player to grow and improve by playing in different conditions
1292158 its a nice opportunity to finish my degree overseas its encouraged over there
1292159 former wallaby coach eddie jones now with saracens and i had good chat and we agree that experiencing rugby from a different perspective may help me grow and improve as a player

1292183 you should stop blaming your parents for your quarrel with reality
1292184 well go on then you say your mother gave you paregoric
1292185 it was a medicine made from camphor and alcohol with a small amount of morphine they gave it to children for cough medicine
1292186 well my mother says she used to rub it on my gums when my teeth were coming in
1292187 so im lying there and i look at the picture of grumpy and he seems to be frowning at me it was scary his eyebrows moved up and down and he blinked then i looked at happy and his red grin got wide and crazy and his nose started stretching and bending sideways his big eyes were crossed and his tongue stuck out it scared me so i looked away and closed my eyes then i could see stars glittering and a big bright golden crescent moon in slow motion a cow floated up into the black starry sky and sailed over the moon
1292188 i think so but i felt so good i didnt care
1292189 you were too young to even know what paregoric was
1292190 years later my mother found those pictures of snow white and the seven dwarfs when she was cleaning out the attic she said do you remember these and i said yeah and then she told me how when i was a baby teething i would cry and cry because teething hurts so she said she rubbed paregoric on my gums after that she said i stopped crying and just looked up at those pictures until i fell asleep
1292191 did you use any other drugs when you were a kid
1292192 it made my eyes itch i sneezed a lot i had to take antihistamine for years sometimes the antihistamine allowed me to dream these amazing technicolor dreams if i took it at night
1292193 some people say we only dream in black and white but ive dreamed in color
1292194 when the pollen was extra bad i had to stay indoors while other guys were playing baseball i was inside drawing pictures and writing stories our kitchen had a linoleum floor with all kinds of squiggly designs in it and if i stared at those squiggles i saw faces and other things
1292195 but there is something more intimate when faces emerge from the floor tiles i also saw them sometimes in the towels hanging in the bathroom in the little threads

1292208 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1292209 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down

1292253 i think it was good that i was let go because it gave me time to mature and grow up and build a fan base being on american idol
1292254 instead of going into an album having to build fans i now have fans going into releasing an album it made it a lot easier hopefully i will continue building that relationship with a bunch more people and get more fans
1292255 i think its kind of cool to be on the same label that i was on before just because i know everybody
1292256 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time

1292321 die ifa ist ein top medienereignis das den wandel in der medienbranche widerspiegelt
1292322 mobilit t ist auch dort ein megatrend aus diesem grund haben wir uns entschlossen die ifa zum anlass zu nehmen unternehmen die sich auf die rapide fortschreitende konvergenz von web mobile und broadcast einstellen m chten ein besonderes angebot zu machen
1292323 die zufriedenstellenden auftragseing nge von der drupa werden unsere operativen gesch ftsergebnisse im zweiten und dritten quartal gegen ber den ersten drei monaten verbessern
1292324 wir konnten unsere weltweit f hrende stellung in der branche auf der messe verdeutlichen nach wie vor ist das aktuelle marktumfeld aber von schwierigen rahmenbedingungen gekennzeichnet zum mittelfristigen ausgleich dieser effekte dient unser bereits eingeleitetes ma nahmenpaket zur verbesserung unserer kostenstruktur
1292325 aufgrund der schwachen umsatzentwicklung sowie der zus tzlichen kostenbelastungen haben wir im ersten quartal des gesch ftsjahres wie bereits angek ndigt ein negatives betriebsergebnis erzielt
1292326 das zur kostensenkung eingeleitete ma nahmenprogramm treiben wir mit allem nachdruck voran so dass die einspareffekte wie geplant realisiert werden k nnen
1292327 es ist das beste und aufregendste was ich je in meinem leben gemacht habe f r mich ist ein traum wahr geworden das ergebnis meines musikvideos hat mich sehr begeistert das gesamte team hat meine pers nliche erwartung weit bertroffen und ich freue mich jetzt schon auf eine aufregende zeit am set mit meiner auserw hlten die arbeit am zweiten song hat bereits begonnen und wer wei vielleicht wird hollywood auf meine einzigartige idee aufmerksam
1292328 interseroh und alba arbeiten in unterschiedlichen m rkten erg nzen sich aber ber die gesamte wertsch pfungskette zum nutzen beider unternehmen sehr gut
1292329 ziel ist es die marktposition von interseroh im europ ischen rahmen auszubauen und zu st rken im aktuellen konsolidierungsprozess wollen wir eine aktive rolle einnehmen
1292330 die idee der alba group fu t darauf dass zwei eigenst ndige und gleichberechtigte unternehmen am markt gemeinsam agieren wenn dies zu ihrem gegenseitigen nutzen ist

1292336 diese auszeichnung macht uns sehr stolz auf das erreichte und ist uns ansporn den von uns eingeschlagenen weg fortzusetzen
1292337 es bleibt unser erkl rtes unternehmensziel weiterhin gesellschaftliche verantwortung zu bernehmen und unseren mitarbeitern nachhaltige perspektiven zu bieten ebenso hat die zufriedenheit unserer nationalen und internationalen kunden weiterhin oberste priorit t
1292338 wir haben es geschafft uns in einem schwierigen und sich schnell wandelnden markt zu etablieren
1292339 nicht minder spannend sind die aktuellen entwicklungen aus und in unserem hause so haben wir mit dem netzwerkanalysetool xnereus bereits einen erfolgreichen start als hersteller hingelegt
1292340 vor allem mittelst ndische unternehmen fragen sich h ufig ob auch sie von flexiblen ocr und data capture l sungen profitieren k nnen
1292341 diese berzeugen wir gerne vor ort von den m glichkeiten der abbyy technologien aber auch f r bestehende kunden und gesch ftspartner halten wir produktneuigkeiten bereit und m chten die messe zum austausch ber branchentrends nutzen
1292342 anche il presbitero quando celebra leucaristia deve servire dio e il popolo con dignit e umilt e nel modo di comportarsi e di pronunziare le parole divine deve far percepire ai fedeli la presenza viva di cristo
1292343 questo sacrificio poi come la stessa passione di cristo sebbene sia offerto per tutti
1292344 il signore riceva dalle tue mani questo sacrificio a lode e gloria del suo nome per il bene nostro e di tutta la sua santa chiesa
1292345 devotamente e con fede i misteri di cristo a lode di dio e santificazione del popolo cristiano secondo la tradizione della chiesa
1292346 troppo grande il mistero delleucaristia perch qualcuno possa permettersi di trattarlo con arbitrio personale che non ne rispetterebbe il carattere sacro e la dimensione universale
1292347 lars celebrandi scaturisce dallobbedienza fedele alle norme liturgiche nella loro completezza poich proprio questo modo di celebrare ad assicurare da duemila anni la vita di fede di tutti i credenti
1292348 unautentica azione liturgica esprime la sacralit del mistero eucaristico questa dovrebbe trasparire nelle parole e nelle azioni del sacerdote celebrante mentre egli intercede presso dio padre sia con i fedeli sia per loro
1292349 lars celebrandi deve favorire il senso del sacro e lutilizzo di quelle forme esteriori che educano a tale senso come ad esempio larmonia del rito delle vesti liturgiche dellarredo e del luogo sacro
1292350 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder

1292356 way i see it you can keep working here and break even but i dont see the point
1292357 the main cause has been the influx of asian made or chinese boards into the uk
1292358 the danger is if this continues at the current rate the industry is going to die
1292359 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1292360 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1292361 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1292362 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1292363 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1292364 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1292365 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1292366 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1292367 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1292368 suspending my journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1292369 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1292370 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
1292371 in the first inning he got a good fastball up and away and he pounded it to right its not easy to play on the road thats pretty good
1292372 were close friends off the field ill talk to him tonight
1292373 he was able to foul off some pretty good pitches and i got him
1292374 the last one was up and off the plate a little and i swung through it
1292375 he started throwing his breaking ball and he had enough on his fastball he made some pretty good pitches
1292376 i kind of sat back on it and pena was aggressive it fell in that little spot where we both wanted to make that last out and we should have talked more but soria came up big at the end
1292377 they were swinging at a lot of pitches up in the zone and luckily thats kind of where my release point was today and i got away with it
1292378 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1292379 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1292380 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1292381 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1292382 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1292383 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1292384 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1292385 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1292386 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1292387 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1292388 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from
1292389 they had nothing new to report the story was about water ice
1292390 note the aviation week story said very very clearly three times or so no life on mars detected and phoenix can not detect life in the first place
1292391 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition
1292392 we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1292393 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1292394 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1292395 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1292396 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear

1292532 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1292533 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1292534 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1292535 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1292536 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1292547 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that

1292601 making a decision was only the beginning of things when someone makes a decision he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision
1292602 the closer one gets to realizing his personal legend the more that personal legend becomes his true reason for being
1292603 intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life where the histories of all people are connected and we are able to know everything because its all written there
1292604 we are afraid of losing what we have whether its our life or our possesions and property but fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand
1292605 when you want something with all your heart thats when you are closest to the sould of the world its always a positive force
1292606 when somone was in such a pursuit of their personal legend the universe made a effort to help him succeed

1292610 its not what enters mens mouths thats evil its what comes out of their mouths that is
1292611 understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his personal legend if he abandons that pursuit its because it wasnt true love

1292617 desde hace meses sindicatos asociaciones la propia direcci n del hospital y el grupo parlamentario socialista vienen reclamando al gobierno auton mico del pp una mayor dotaci n de personal de este servicio porque la escasez de profesionales lleva a los que est n cumpliendo con su trabajo al l mite de su capacidad f sica y psiquica

1292619 si a estas alturas cuando a n no han empezado los turnos de vacaciones nos encontramos ya con tantos problemas el caos este verano va a ser mayor a n que el pasado porque la junta no ha tomado a tiempo las medidas necesarias

1292638 penso che non riuscir mai a ripagare i debiti che ho fatto per studiare certi giorni penso che quando morir avr ancora le rate delluniversit oggi ho un piano per restituire il prestito che dura 27 anni e mezzo ma mi pare troppo ambizioso perch il tasso variabile e riesco solo a pagare gli interessi sono sicura che quando compir sessantanni i debiti della scuola di legge saranno ancora l a farmi compagnia
1292639 ma ho lo stesso debito adesso di quando ho finito la scuola perch ogni mese riesco a fare soltanto il pagamento minimo che copre a malapena gli interessi sul capitale che mi hanno prestato e siccome la rata anche salita insieme ai tassi dinteresse non ho fatto nessun passo avanti
1292640 per sopravvivere ho dovuto trovarmi un secondo lavoro faccio il tutor per alcuni studenti la sera e durante il fine settimana e accetto ogni lavoretto che mi passa per le mani solo cos posso permettermi di vivere da sola prima di fare la scuola di legge avevo lavorato per due anni nel settore non profit ma mi ero subito resa conto che senza un master non avrei mai potuto accedere ai livelli di lavoro che pi mi piacevano e cos la specializzazione in legge mi sembr la scelta migliore ma la mia famiglia non era in grado di pagare la retta n io avevo soldi per farlo cos ho chiesto due prestiti uno pubblico e uno privato
1292641 avevo scelto di andare proprio a villanova perch l davano una borsa di studio chiamata public service che copriva ben il cinquanta per cento della retta se tu ti impegnavi a lavorare nel settore pubblico nei primi cinque anni dopo la fine degli studi questo mi impedisce oggi di fare lavori pi remunerativi ma ho anche la met dei debiti dei miei compagni di corso
1292642 negli ultimi dieci anni due milioni di studenti meritevoli non hanno potuto frequentare luniversit perch non avevano i soldi necessari
1292643 e inaccettabile ripete obama unamerica in cui non puoi mettere a frutto il tuo talento perch non sei ricco di famiglia perfino la retta dei college cresciuta del 40 per cento negli ultimi cinque anni e cos lingresso al college che per generazioni di americani stato il passaporto per un futuro migliore oggi un sogno che per molti sta svanendo
1292644 io sono la meno indebitata della mia classe la maggior parte dei miei compagni di scuola che non hanno avuto la borsa di studio e oggi lavorano come avvocati negli studi privati devono restituire una cifra che va da 120 a 150mila dollari io nel settore pubblico guadagno 45mila dollari lordi lanno loro almeno 20mila dollari in pi per chi ha trovato posto in un piccolo studio legale prende intorno ai 65mila dollari ma avendo il doppio dei debiti se la passa ben peggio visto che deve pagare pi di mille dollari al mese chi invece entrato nellempireo negli studi con pi di 500 avvocati guadagna oltre 100mila dollari allanno del gruppo di amici con cui ho studiato eravamo in cinque ben tre hanno scelto di fare lavori che non amano e che anzi detestano per poter estinguere il debito
1292645 sto attentissima a come spendo i soldi segno su un quaderno ogni spesa che faccio dal caff al biglietto dellautobus perch devo tenere ogni cosa sotto controllo se voglio arrivare alla fine del mese
1292646 non penso esistesse un altro modo volevo davvero andare a quella scuola e leducazione che ho ricevuto mi permette di poter fare il lavoro che desideravo senza la scuola di legge questa carriera non sarebbe stata possibile ma non mi basteranno trentanni per ripagare il debito ho unamica di famiglia che si laureata a villanova 15 anni prima di me e aveva un prestito simile ora ha avuto dei figli e lavora part time e non riesce sempre a pagare le rate
1292647 io penso che sia osceno che un ragazzo debba indebitarsi per tutta la vita per poter studiare

1292650 were hoping huge economic developments is the main goal theres a lot of flat land there that could be made available to build maybe industry or some kind of businesses which is really what carroll county needs to survive in todays marketplace
1292651 so it could be as early as 2015 which is very exciting for us because the sooner we get it built the better its going to be for the county
1292652 i knew commissioners had a dealing with many many things throughout the county whereas the other offices are sort of keyed in on just that specific office this way with the commissioners seat i have learned a lot about all the other offices that i havent had the opportunity to work in
1292653 theres two sides to every thing and you have to make a decision theres just no way around it and you do make people unhappy but you have to weigh out what is best for the county when you are thinking about making a decision on anything

1292660 theres a lot of oil that has not been drilled for here i think its out of pure selfishness that theyre drilling in other countries when we have a bunch of oil here that still needs to be drilled for
1292661 i think off shore drilling is a bad idea especially in alaska it just ruins the environment more they can harvest hemp three times a year which would give us the oil we need not including the sugar cane or the corn

1292720 the great strength of unionism is that it is possible to be a left wing unionist a right wing unionist or a centrist unionist
1292721 unionism is bigger than left right politics and is able to encompass all people with all political positions on socio economic matters by aligning themselves in a clear and unambiguous way with a centre right political party the leadership of the uup is effectively telling its members with centrist or left wing political leanings that they are no longer welcome
1292722 when mr mccausland claims unionism is bigger than left right politics he is effectively saying that northern ireland should not be a full part of the uk
1292723 left right conservative labour politics are the politics of the uk the politics of the union are bigger than what passes for unionism in northern ireland
1292724 the dup may settle for the politics of ourselves alone but our leader david cameron is determined that people in northern ireland should no longer be treated as second class citizens in the uk

1292727 i want to congratulate pupils all over scotland for their achievements today i know todays results represent months of dedication and hard work by them and their teachers combined with support of their parents and friends have resulted in the certificates they have received today
1292728 as scotlands young people continue to aim high and achieve so much we can look to a future where scotland is smarter and we can compete on equal terms with the rest of the world even in these difficult economic times the continuing healthy uptake and attainment in science and modern languages by our young people demonstrates the continued drive to make scotland a more competitive place to do business
1292729 for those who have not received the grades they were aiming for today there is comprehensive advice and support out there to guide them through the many options that can help them realise their goals
1292730 it is evident that by investing in our employees through the delivery of well structured and tailored training we can realise a truly skilled workforce that will improve productivity raise skills standards and improve the quality of customer service everyone reaps the benefits employees companies and ultimately the wider economy apprenticeshipsni will further enable employers to develop and enhance the skills of its workforce
1292731 employers undoubtedly have a vital role to play in encouraging and facilitating apprenticeships i urge all employers both large and small to really make it their business this year to find out more about apprenticeships and how they can help their business grow as well as raise the skills level of the northern ireland workforce
1292732 there has never been a more challenging time for energy policy in northern ireland i welcome the opportunity to engage with the chairman and chief executive of niaur on how we address the numerous challenges and balance the interests of business householders and the environment
1292733 our distinctive childrens hearings system which is recognised by experts across the world makes a huge difference to young peoples lives guiding them through difficult times behaviour and circumstances
1292734 this may include ensuring appropriate services are in place to help vulnerable children who have been abused or neglected or even those who have committed a crime so that they can get their lives back on track
1292735 by improving support for those who deliver that system both professionals and panel members they can in turn focus their skills on creating a better and brighter future for the children who need our help
1292736 the creation of the single national body will also allow us to reduce bureaucracy in the system while ensuring services continue to be delivered locally and with great consistency in decision making for the benefit of everyone involved
1292737 we welcome the publication of the consultation document on the reform of the childrens hearings system in scotland scra looks forward to reviewing the proposals and contributing to the consultation process in support of the governments view that the hearings system is the best way of providing assistance and support to scotlands vulnerable children and their families
1292738 i welcome the publication of the consultation document and look forward to considering in more detail the proposals which will help shape the future of the childrens hearings system
1292739 for too long regulation has pitched government regulators and businesses against each other
1292740 this government simply will not allow regulation to be a battleground any longer at a time of global economic uncertainty it is crucial that we all work together to deliver the kind of competitive environment in which businesses can flourish
1292741 that means all regulation should be carefully road tested to determine exactly how it will impact on business thats a key recommendation of todays report and one that we are determined to take forward as a government
1292742 todays report will signal a new era where we can work together with business to deliver this greatly improved partnership approach to the regulations we introduce as a government
1292743 regulation in scotland emanates as much from westminster and europe as it does holyrood so i am particularly pleased the report recommends westminster pays greater attention to scotlands distinct circumstance in framing regulations
1292744 and i am also convinced of the need for the scottish government to make its own case on regulations affecting scotland directly to the eu rather than relying on westminster departments that is something we will take forward at both eu and uk level
1292745 the government is extremely grateful for the work done by professor russel griggs and the rest of the group they have our guarantee that we will now look at the recommendations carefully and work closely with them on how best to take the better regulation agenda forward
1292746 to achieve what we believe is possible as is set out in our annual report to make scotland the leader in regulation in terms of its appropriateness and proportionality to all parties involved will take a real culture shift across business government and its regulators

1292750 there are many aspects of our current food system which are damaging our environment through wasteful practices and producing poor quality food
1292751 it simply does not need to be the case that londoners cannot have access to locally produced top quality food but we have to have a radical rethink to find ways of making this happen

1292841 i dont actually believe ea is in the business of exploiting other peoples licenses with bad quality games
1292842 weve been there most of our competitors are there or have been there thats not what we do were not really after that market
1292843 my team and our developers know a good game when we see it the products were putting out this year from hasbro i dont know how theyre going to do with
1292844 it feels like its demographically similar but its very highly innovative i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1292845 a good run in the competition is a distinct possibility with the group stages offering a relatively comfortable passage to the knock out stages
1292846 if the tie is not sewn up by half time it would be a huge surprise given the standard of the opposition
1292847 there was absolutely no reason for me to change the captaincy this season
1292848 it was important for me to understand richards situation when i arrived here and to get it resolved and now everyone is happy
1292849 i have been delighted with the response that richard has made since he has signed
1292850 he has been part of this squad and this club for a long long time and i felt it was important that we made sure he would continue to be a big part of things
1292851 the strength and the pace that he has at the back will be one of the keys to the way we play this year
1292852 i do feel he needs a better and more potent partner alongside him than vassell and this maybe an area hughes is still

1292860 these days people are so paranoid of a little too much fat
1292861 i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1292862 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
1292863 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
1292864 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
1292865 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
1292866 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
1292867 your debate about the future of the settlements and about the necessity of the presence in the territories just served to strengthen us to continue with the terrorist attacks the people of the peace camp in israel those who spoke of the end of the occupation and of retreat pushed us forward in our decision to continue with the suicide bombings

1292878 its true its quite a wealthy country and they have some structures in place to deal with health but we wanted to be in place in case something very important occurs
1292879 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1292880 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1292881 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1292882 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1292883 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1292884 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world

1292948 death without due consideration overcoming barriers to mitigation evidence by warming capital jurors to the accused
1292949 t he primary explanatory variable was the jurors perceptions of the attorney client relationship
1292950 reveals that jurors are more receptive to mitigation evidence when they view the relationship between the attorney and client as warm and friendly
1292951 ironically that same study of capital jurors revealed that they became less receptive to mitigating evidence if they perceived that the attorney and client worked too closely together

1292955 a fter hundreds of hours debriefing actual jurors and watching mock juries deliberate
1292956 i now know that a great deal of lawyers accepted wisdom about jury psychology is completely baseless
1292957 lawyers are skilled at many things but understanding and connecting to jurors is generally not one of them this shouldnt be a surprise when you consider that most lawyers actually have no frame of reference in the first place they rarely see juries in action the vast majority of civil cases settle before trial and few litigators ever serve on juries or watch mock jurors deliberate in addition lawyers typically have little in common either socially or economically with the average juror
1292958 for generations lawyers have told each other that the jurys opinion of the lawyer is important to their decision in the case trial lawyers think that what they wear and how charming they are influences jurors they think they can dazzle juries with their eloquence this is a huge misconception
1292959 another area thats rife with legal folklore is jury selection many lawyers judge prospective jurors using outmoded stereotypes reflecting an overly simplistic view
1292960 a good voir dire is designed to elicit information that helps you to see the jurors as individuals this sounds obvious but many lawyers dont seem to get it instead they use this valuable opportunity to try and educate or condition jurors this is largely a waste of time

1292972 the court no ones asking the life history and the things that bring you to this place but thats not what you started out saying maam
1292973 prospective juror l yes i have to really go and think about that a whole lot i cant just take their word
1292974 the court im going to excuse you from your jury service maam but im going to require you to sit through this entire trial so you can get an objective view of how people of how people do testify
1292975 the court if you fail to appear on any day of the trial that will be considered contempt of court because this is a direct order
1292976 i think what youre saying youre contradicting yourself about what youre saying and we have had jehovahs witnesses that do sit on juries
1292977 prospective juror d made a comment which is completely wrong just because mr gaither is here does not mean he must be guilty of something that is the antithesis the opposite of what our judicial system is about
1292978 mr gaither sits before each and every one of you right now and he is innocent until there has been evidence sufficient to what i will instruct the jury on to prove him guilty and thats beyond a reasonable doubt nobody here has heard one piece of evidence about anything and despite what prospective juror d said in her misguided beliefs about not judging people that was absolutely wrong he sits here an innocent man until evidence has been presented until and if evidence has been presented sufficient to prove that hes guilty does everyone here understand that if you do not understand that raise your hand right now i am vehemently serious about that
1292979 so if i have misled any of you into thinking that i am some angry shrew up here i am not i really and truly am not and if any of you believe for one single minute that you are not free to say what is true in answer to the lawyers questions please raise your hand right now and i will let you go that is a promise to you if you feel too intimidated to answer the lawyers questions honestly raise your hand right now and youve just got a free pass out of here and i wont berate you i wont be mad i will be mad only at myself for having caused this environment that you would feel that way so this is your opportunity anybody want to leave
1292980 dear mr vernon we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong but we think youre crazy to make an essay telling you who we think we are you see us as you want to see us in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain

1293046 the discussion will be open and is designed to have a clear and clean situation for everybody for the 2012 olympics which will be played in london
1293047 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let the young players have the experience
1293048 the moment i received the bronze medal in the olympics in seoul 1988 when germany beat italy it was my number one outstanding emotion
1293049 we need the leagues and the clubs but we need players

1293144 we are delighted to be welcoming the feeling to the regent they represent rock pop at its very best and will undoubtedly perform a fantastic show although please dont complain to us if you cant get the songs out of your head for the next six months

1293146 access to the proposed store will be across wet grassland which according to suffolk wildlife trust is of ecological significance

1293148 not only is the riverside walk much appreciated by local residents and many visitors for its wild flowers birds and tranquil atmosphere it is of considerable local conservation value

1293150 other important species which are present along the riverside and in adjacent fields and meadows include water voles otters bats toads slow worm and grass snake

1293152 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1293153 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1293154 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1293155 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1293156 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1293157 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1293158 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1293159 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention

1293161 the comment was made numerous times we just dont know what to do with this guy because that country rock thing is dead its over i thought man these guys havent been to a charlie daniels or a lynyrd skynyrd or hank williams jr show lately have they also i think a lot of them just couldnt get past the long hair and the leather

1293163 my image was nothing contrived i was a product of the biker bars and the pool halls and the beer joints and the bowling alleys i had played for so many years before i ever got a record deal
1293164 the boards action is against the interests of the nation and risks the safety of thousands of american traveling and living abroad
1293165 we must now rely on the u s supreme court to prevent texas from breaking a commitment made by the president and senate on behalf of the country as a whole
1293166 mr medellin raised that issue before the trial in pre trial he didnt raise the issue and he didnt raise the issue during the trial
1293167 if he had raised the issue at his probable cause hearing the court would have complied and it was never raised
1293168 they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth
1293169 a us appeals court has given the thumbs up to cablevisions new age dvr which stores recorded shows on remote servers rather than in home hard drives
1293170 cablevision would not directly infringe plaintiffs under the copyright act by offering its rs dvr system to consumers
1293171 in march 2006 cablevision announced that it would be launching a
1293172 sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be reproduced for a period of more than transitory duration
1293173 sheen and petersen are at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do
1293174 youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1293175 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1293176 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1293177 she walked out of her work into a parking lot and was gunned down she would have been notified in advance knowing that he was in the area
1293178 a powerful tool that will help us in the future protect our victims
1293179 at least 10 different ways that this legislation will help me
1293180 we think that it is a deterrent and a better way to monitor what we feel are high risk parolees
1293181 i have had cases where people violate an order of protection as soon as they get out of the courthouse and make phone calls and make text messages
1293182 ive had it where theyve been standing in the courthouse and they were doing it
1293183 corporations may now sometimes fulfill their public disclosure requirements under regulation fd by
1293184 we have no reliable record that the website ever showed that
1293185 if we were meant to fly we wouldnt keep losing our luggage
1293186 the government will begin issuing hundreds of thousands of new public service cards later this year which will be used to access state services such as welfare benefits free travel and medical rebates
1293187 internet users right to access the lawful internet content and to use the applications of their choice
1293188 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
1293189 our investigation and the findings of several widely respected engineers confirmed the complaints comcast was delaying subscribers downloads and blocking uploads it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be even worse comcast was hiding the fact by making effected uses think there as a problem with their internet connection or the application
1293190 an extraordinary amount of bandwidth even during peak network congestion
1293191 with him being an ex norwich player i shouted see you later bellamy and he just turned around and swore at me and he said something about prostitutes in ipswich
1293192 he was not very nice i was shocked because i had my daughter there and there were other kids around in the same area
1293193 i heard him swear and say something about ipswich prostitutes i think that it was atrocious because young kids where there he said it in front of the family stand
1293194 i was just absolutely gobsmacked there is no need to behave like that we pay lots of money to come to these games and i do not expect my sons to hear words like that i will take it up with the football club
1293195 both ipswich town and west ham are aware of an alleged incident that is being investigated internally if a criminal offence is identified then we will take things further
1293196 we are aware of an alleged incident involving craig bellamy and we will be giving every assistance required by suffolk police in their investigations of the matter
1293197 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened we take such allegations seriously
1293198 i havent spoken to anyone to find out what was allegedly said
1293199 physicians should use esas with caution based on the international guidelines for esa administration in cancer and on certain prognostic indicators to guide their use physicians need to identify the appropriate group of cancer patients who will benefit from esa administration while avoiding possible detrimental effects
1293200 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1293201 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1293202 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs
1293203 just another avenue for us to highlight that barack obamas energy policy is completely out of touch with what americans need
1293204 hes playing politics at a time when america needs real leadership
1293205 he says inflate your tires and tune up your cars and we dont need to drill
1293206 while the mccain team is busy amusing themselves the fact is that the idea theyre attacking is supported by among others top mccain surrogate joe lieberman of connecticut governors charlie crist of florida and arnold schwarzenegger of california the department of energy and nascar all of whom have urged americans to help save energy by minding tire pressure
1293207 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1293208 from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record doubt and spreading famine that could engulf our planet
1293209 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1293210 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1293211 we need to aggressively develop alternative energies like wind solar tide bio fuels and geothermal but we also need to expand our use of existing energy resources here at home
1293212 that means we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas
1293213 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
1293214 and anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1293215 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1293216 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1293217 increasing the fuel efficiency of replacement tires for our cars to the same level as those sold on new automobiles will save drivers 90 in fuel costs over the lifetime of the tires and will save the u
1293218 we all do have the power lets not wait for government
1293219 energy prices are not going back to the good old days
1293220 confident that we are more than capable and ready to address any threat situation in the area that may arise as a result of the ongoing peace negotiation
1293221 our position is that after initialing both parties initialed the memorandum of agreement that is a signing
1293222 productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids
1293223 the main barrier to essential medicines is not the current price of drugs the real obstacle is the fragility of the health systems you have health infrastructure that is dilapidated and supply chains that do not exist
1293224 we lack quality infrastructure to test the quality and purity of drugs
1293225 we are devastated by the loss of ben and catherine
1293226 china has focused on strengthening security and protection so beijing is already prepared to respond to any threat
1293227 we agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic
1293228 the 1918 pandemic is considered to be and clearly is something unique and its widely understood to be the most lethal natural event that has occurred in recent human history
1293229 the bottom line is we think the influenza virus itself was necessary but not sufficient to cause most of the deaths
1293230 may your troubles be less may your blessings be more may nothing but happiness come through your door
1293231 el latifundio entendido como grandes extensiones de tierras improductivas no est reconocido por el gobierno departamental aut nomo de santa cruz se lo persigue y sanciona por ser contrario al inter s colectivo y no cumplir ninguna funci n social ni econ mica social

1293235 we were willing to work with the city on that but they obviously werent interested
1293236 cheap unhealthy food and lack of access to healthy food is a recipe for obesity

1293238 people who buy shares will actually help me focus more on the novel
1293239 i actually will work better on my second novel the way the novel is right now if i have no obligations or responsibilities at all
1293240 if anyone buys shares they will have concrete motivation to promote me and that also will increase sales
1293241 if people buy shares i will probably i think make even more money than if i had not sold shares of my royalties
1293242 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk of increasing relative poverty and continued exclusion from quality primary health care services
1293243 unless discrimination against women and girls is addressed as part of overall strategies to improve child and maternal health high rates of maternal and child mortality will remain stubbornly entrenched
1293244 theyre going to do tests to find out what happened
1293245 i jammed yuniesky betancourt but he found a hole andy pitching coach rick anderson came out and talked about willie bloomquist and said throw him a good pitch down and away get him to hit a ground ball found a hole then i make a bad pitch to ibanez and that sours the night
1293246 thats the last thing you want a 6 5 game
1293247 just terrible pitches and balls flying out all over the place
1293248 i have said no to some very cheeky showing underwear i do not like to do that and ive said no to different bras that do different things
1293249 i love it i come into hair and make up now and its 10 minutes instead of two hours its way more fun to play frumpy then you can focus on story and character as opposed to having to always look great i feel like shes dealing with a lot of real issues
1293250 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover in the antarctic then it means there are going to be changes in the amount of habitat that the whales have available to them
1293251 and were not sure how adaptable they are to living in a different kind of habitat
1293252 this is indeed a tremendous opportunity for indian companies who are looking to not only expand their businesses globally but to also have experts from the region help provide a wealth of knowledge
1293253 ive owned and used sigmaplot for more than a decade and i love it
1293254 we do both clinical and pharmacological research and sigmaplot enables us to analyze and sort through large amounts of data to create and publish graphs that can be transposed to manuscripts and directly submitted to publications the product is that user friendly and great i cant wait to upgrade to sigmaplot 1
1293255 i have been using sigmaplot for 15 years and cannot envision being able to do my process optimization without it i frequently analyze process data from customers with non linear trends sigmaplot allows me to graph and trend the data in such a way that i can easily convey observations and recommendations to customers
1293256 he would not need a mask to play that role
1293257 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1293258 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1293259 ive decided to make a visit to mourn the people who sacrificed their precious lives in the war and to pray for lasting peace
1293260 its up to the individual what kind of shrine one visits but it is also necessary to behave by taking into consideration various things from the viewpoint of the chief cabinet secretary as a public figure
1293261 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1293262 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1293263 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1293264 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1293265 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1293266 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1293267 i have people out here who live by me who have four and five children and you can imagine how it is on them
1293268 its more important for us to utilize state dollars for textbooks workbooks we try to focus on those things
1293269 we found we were going in a lot of different directions
1293270 you are playing nursemaid counselor janitor every role you think a mom would play that is what we are doing
1293271 i think the cost of everything is going up including sending your child to school
1293272 for me it is really important over the next couple of weeks starting here at the olympics going on to the us open
1293273 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfill my dream to win gold
1293274 i know eight is the lucky number here maybe because my birthday and everything that has also brought me luck here in china who knows
1293275 i hope being able to carry the flag for switzerland which is a great honor for me starting with that and then hopefully performing well its going to be a dream olympics for me
1293276 i usually always stay at hotels all year long at tournaments so i said you know this time ill try this way
1293277 but i have to say the village is beautiful very nice very well done here with the vegetation and everything so its nice to be able to be part of the team like that
1293278 im here a few days earlier than in previous olympics
1293279 for our purposes usually were there 2 3 days ahead but now 7 8 days so actually thats a lot of practice and i had a good flight in from the states which is a long trip but i feel fine
1293280 everyone has a chance well see down the stretch who is going to have the best day and i hope its going to be me
1293281 the volunteers struggled to hold themselves back but its part of the spirit so its no problem
1293282 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs
1293283 it is just because it is so close to the olympics
1293284 but dont worry this doesnt affect ordinary people like you and me
1293285 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1293286 weapons were similar to those captured by police from an east turkestan terror camp in january 2007
1293287 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1293288 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1293289 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1293290 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs
1293291 win a comprehensive victory in the security battle for the olympics and to protect the harmony and stability of tibetan society
1293292 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1293293 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us

1293298 we are still talking with lehman and waiting for their next step
1293299 so far what they have done is just to scrap the previous report thats not enough
1293300 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1293301 net borrowings provided by the bank of england have reduced to 17 5 billion pounds compared with 26 9 billion pounds at the end of december 2007 and are ahead of the business plan
1293302 erdogan invited him and they have issues to discuss such as peace talks
1293303 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70
1293304 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place
1293305 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1293306 you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1293307 no strings relationships have helped cure me of love addiction
1293308 all my life ive been in long term monogamous relationships
1293309 i had to break that pattern by not allowing myself to have a relationship for a year stopping myself from committing to men
1293310 i havent been celibate ive had lots of dates and lots of sex but i havent been pushing to turn a date into a relationship this has been a huge thing for me
1293311 the big change last november was a reduction from 40 million people worldwide living with hiv to 33 2 million there was also a reduction in estimates of new infections from 4 to 5 million down to around 2 5 million per year
1293312 do i think the current estimates are good yes i do
1293313 i without asking any further question gave them my resignation letter because they pledged that they were told by the president to collect the resignation and produce it in a meeting of the the sgpc at kurukshetra on tuesday
1293314 india in fact the world is on the cusp of a most profound change visualize a business environment where the goal of improvement has given way to an unabashed commitment to destruction innovation imagine a new brand of employees jumping from project to project a new brand of enterprise with an entrepreneurial mindset a new society that embraces the idea of global village and change
1293315 o cara tinha tanta espinha no rosto que mal dava pra ver o piercing
1293316 these new enhancements were developed in response to our customer needs
1293317 dow jones insight allows organizations to identify and respond to any opportunities and threats in time to influence the outcome as a result we help organizations optimize their communications programs and drive winning campaign strategies
1293318 if you think about how an operating system is loaded its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1293319 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1293320 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1293321 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
1293322 market players tend to return to the yen as the low yielding currency is considered a safe haven
1293323 this group of new members demonstrates the expanding reach of the pismo ecosystem and we are very excited by the capabilities and expertise they bring to the pismo industry consortium
1293324 agilents extensive test measurement and probing capabilities combined with samtecs expertise in developing robust board interconnect solutions with access to mentors state of the art simulation tools will be extremely important for the next generation pismo specification aimed at supporting memory devices operating at frequencies up to 533mhz higher operating frequencies require designers to have access to more advanced tools to address signal integrity and crosstalk and require reliable probing solutions for debugging troubleshooting testing and validating pismo modules with high speed devices
1293325 parents have come to recognize social skills more than mere niceties for everyday life are the base for raising great kids who ultimately become successful confident and happy adults
1293326 these skills which include listening being polite and knowing how to share shape how a child will be perceived by their peers teachers adults and ultimately employers
1293327 more than ever our children must get along with others to function effectively
1293328 in this age of team sports and structured play it has never been more critical for our children to master socialization skills from childrens play groups to collaboration in the classroom kids today engage in significantly more structured group activities raising the profile and the necessity for good social skills
1293329 as preschools and kindergartens turn to an increasingly academic curriculum the necessity is that children come into the classroom with basic social skills in place
1293330 additionally there are many resources for assistance in teaching academic skills however the tools and help for teaching social skills are very limited it is really up to the parents to figure it out
1293331 while parents understand the need for behavior correction it can become frustrating
1293332 especially with the added time pressures of a typical busy family schedule we dont want to spend what limited time we do have being the bad guy and constantly correcting our childrens behavior
1293333 this knowledge coupled with the recognition that raising great kids is both incredibly challenging and unbelievably rewarding prompted us to create a tool that would provide help to moms nationwide
1293334 for generations parents have used games with their preschoolers to teach academic skills like colors numbers and letters
1293335 similarly noodleboro games were created to reinforce social skills they are designed to give parents a helping hand when it comes to raising great kids by making social skill learning a little bit easier and a lot more fun
1293336 because ive had so much happiness from hello dolly through the years i never expected to have this new layer of excitement
1293337 if you look at history you will see that as a result of the people moving away from the party of government regimes like the nazis have come into power
1293338 i dont want to think that the speaker disclosed them on purpose and i dont have any intention of comparing the democrats to the nazis
1293339 he was saying that the fact that debate has not been progressing in parliament is a serious problem and that the nazi regime arose from a similar situation
1293340 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1293341 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1293342 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1293343 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1293344 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1293345 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
1293346 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success
1293347 gee its kind of funny that youre calling in with a linksys router that isnt able to get an ip address had a lot of linksys router users call us today and tell us that
1293348 spice up your router or charter and linksys can bite me
1293349 we are excited to be part of the history and re investment in the st louis hills neighborhood
1293350 president bush is just waiting to see the full effect of the first stimulus package
1293351 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
1293352 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
1293353 my role was to help with planting mulching digging and supervising in a guest capacity
1293354 mary beth wanted me to go because im a veteran of world war ii were slipping away fast
1293355 i met a lot of good people theyre all good people
1293356 i was looking over the cemetery and could see through a big tree and some bushes a 2 3 year old boy sitting in a big pile of mulch
1293357 this little guy was filling this little bucket that wouldnt fill up
1293358 as a way of giving back to him for all his years of service
1293359 just a small gesture on our organizations part to show our appreciation
1293360 right now there are 32 funerals a day at arlington
1293361 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1293362 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1293363 une des plus dures de ma vie mais quand je suis rentr chez moi je savais pourquoi j tais sur terre
1293364 ces terroristes sont des assassins qui tentent dattiser la haine entre des communaut s qui jour apr s jour se respectent ou au moins se tol rent
1293365 les ennemis de la nation ont souill et ensanglant la terre du mahatma gandhi qui est n au gujarat et y a fond son premier ashram les terroristes poursuivent leur guerre contre linde tuer des innocents est un type de crime contre lhumanit tous ceux qui croient en lhumanit devraient se pr parer une longue guerre pour la paix
1293366 its because of people like you theres hunger in the world
1293367 all they know is they are mad about 4 a gallon gas the price of milk to logically explain it to people is next to impossible
1293368 all you hope for is the voice of reason to take over for people to realize that the effects of energy are much more exhausting than the price of corn and other products
1293369 ive been all for it for a couple years now
1293370 i know it affects food but everything affects foods now
1293371 weve got to get away from dependency on oil and gasoline by itself we need other options
1293372 it proves the point that ethanol is a good efficient fuel source
1293373 i guess you could say that it adds to our energy stability for our country when we can cut back on what were buying from overseas its a fuel that gives us control over our future
1293374 the more we can produce in our country the more we can have control over it
1293375 unfortunately ethanol is the flavor of the month to be beaten up for a lot for the worlds ills right now
1293376 its overall fuel cost to move your food from around the country
1293377 this is why your food prices go up ethanol has only contributed to 3 to 3 5 percent of why your food has gone up
1293378 i dont use it exclusively only cause i cant find it
1293379 its kind of a standard we use they should expect customers get 20 percent less on running on e85
1293380 the thing is thats the great thing about flex fuel vehicles people can make the decisions for themselves
1293381 but that speaks well of the hall of fame that they look at things besides the win loss record
1293382 as a coach i tried to do what was good for golf and for the kids
1293383 mikes love of the kids the game and the teaching of lifelong living skills to these young people are a major part of the success of our junior golf program

1293387 i was really fortunate to play with someone like keiser he took us a lot of places
1293388 hanging out with people like that it was just their demeanor they accepted the good as well as the misfortunes
1293389 just like with any sport golf teaches you a lot about yourself and life

1293391 the second big advantage of linux is also obvious its free as in speech or open source and therefore any code created on this machine wireless n networking and linux

1293395 we toiled and toiled and talked and talked about this for a long time and we have a great staff here and we didnt want to see anyone go

1293399 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1293400 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1293401 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1293402 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1293403 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september

1293406 if there was a competition for the country with the most pessimistic consumers the uk would be the winner
1293407 despite the undoubted pedigree of the competition the uk consumer easily wins the title of the most pessimistic in europe and probably the developed world even us confidence has been more resilient
1293408 surging inflation and rising unemployment are likely to have been the main contributors given the recently announced huge increases in utility bills which came after the consumer confidence survey was conducted there remains scope for a further decline in the coming months

1293414 its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become its ok for children to see people killed by guns spreading a little love right now would be a good idea
1293415 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea

1293426 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1293427 to be someone kids look up to is a great honor what matters is how you carry yourself off and on the field
1293428 people always say to me why would you place yourself in a position where you have to put pressure on yourself but its what gives me energy
1293429 i never do anything where i dont believe in what im doing i see that something could happen in u s soccer that change isnt going to happen in a year or two its more of a 5 10 or even 15 year plan i believe in it and i believe that in years to come this could be one of the biggest sports here in america
1293430 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend 4 hours with the kids than 4 hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1293431 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1293432 taking over from vaughan is massive but the lad whos coming in will believe he can fill those boots hes a very confident guy and an unbelievable cricketer the qualities that make him the player he is are the same ones he will take into his captaincy he will believe he can be the best captain ever hes that kind of bloke things are about to get very exciting
1293433 the captain needs his players and ill be there for him as im sure the other lads will too anyone taking a job like this will seek advice from a number of people and kev knows my door is always open to him its a tough job you are constantly scrutinised and the pressure is always there the one thing you need is people around you to talk that was one thing i dont think i was particularly good at or had but im sure kevin will
1293434 hes helped all of us out with our careers but hes going out like this he deserved to go out on a high not a series defeat to south africa

1293436 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1293437 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew
1293438 it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1293439 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them

1293447 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1293448 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression

1293452 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1293453 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1293454 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1293455 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1293456 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1293457 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression

1293460 gentili telespettatori vi stato raccontato che nelle altre democrazie il premier coperto da immunit bene siamo lieti di informarvi che non vero limmunit ce lha solo il nostro
1293461 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura
1293462 la stampa israeliana terribile quando ha un pezzo di carne tra i denti difficile che lo molli neppure se si chiama olmert maariv e yedioth ahronot hanno pubblicato le deposizioni del premier parola per parola verbali devastanti per olmert dalla procura spiegano che le prove acquisite vanno ben oltre la testimonianza di talansky olmert dovr testimoniare per la quarta volta

1293465 we have already provided 1 961 health cards to the construction labourers in the candolim primary health centre area up to june 2008 besides renewal of 552 cards and further imposed a fine of around rs 76 000 to those contractors who have not gone for health cards for their labourers

1293468 in the past six months 50 000 malaria cases have been reported across the country in the same period last year 200 000 cases were reported

1293470 the outbreak in bario was caused by a fast growing strain that multiplies rapidly within 24 hours instead of the usual 48 hours or 72 hours
1293471 this is something that we state health authorities are very worried about because it spreads very fast it can attack the body organs rapidly even the brain
1293472 the health teams deployed in bario are now collecting as much data as possible on the latest situation in the affected regions
1293473 we want to accurately identify those places infected by this fast spreading strain
1293474 we wanted to show that we were in support of the troops
1293475 the people over there believe in what they are doing

1293483 i know that people may be feeling the pinch financially and many arent selling their houses but it seems theyre happy to refresh their walls with artwork
1293484 we thought with the economy going as it is we would see less people here than last year but just over 10 000 attended and 1587 works were sold
1293485 its been a wonderful opportunity to expose my work and meet other artists i spend six to eight hours a day in my garage working alone all year and this is great for my confidence and i do think it makes a big difference if people can meet and talk to the artist
1293486 for me to have people see my work and what i do is brilliant i think the repercussions of this will be great and help me to sell my stuff through other galleries later on
1293487 its all about paint and colour for me and where i am at at the time
1293488 i had a wonderful opening night and it remained steady throughout the three days
1293489 i take the clay and start with sausages for legs and arms and then create these roly poly women who take on a character of their own
1293490 i really believe in encouraging new artists and this is a great chance for people to start to sell their work its lovely to see so many visitors come in and see that art can be affordable
1293491 as at 12 noon the community was still burning with over 500 people rendered homeless and their sources of livelihood totally ruined he added that the whereabout of over 600 persons is yet to be established
1293492 i intend that by next week this document will be placed as a memo adopted by the minister of energy for consideration and passage by federal executive council and that will form the first critical step for the implementation of the recommendation of the report
1293493 indeed all of us know that other national oil companies that have come into being after our national oil company are now by far ahead of us because they have restructured and operating in a manner that this report proposes to organise our petroleum sector and have a truly national oil company that will be commercially and profit oriented and that will compete with other national oil companies elsewhere in the world

1293495 in particular the nba must reject this affront on the judiciary by the attorney general
1293496 the justice of this case is that parties to this suit should maintain the status quo so that the subject matter will not be destroyed
1293497 the subject matter is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants on august 14
1293498 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications
1293499 a court order must be so explicit to the effect that the person who is bound by it should be able to comply
1293500 this is a clear case of policy and position paper failure here is a situation of two reluctances enl and michelle at the time enl was presented with choice option of c and d and they chose d they have statutory logic have rejected c as an offer
1293501 at the time enl rejected terminal c ground rule 7 subsists and he rejected c offered to michelle and accepted at this time the position policy was very clear and this is the position the committee recommends to the house there shall be no single concessionaire the rejected one offered to the reserved bidder
1293502 the gas master plan as proposed by the ministry of energy gas needs to be reviewed
1293503 there are some constitutional issues we have observed and they have to be treated because it does appear to us as if the extent of the gas master plan which is basically to promote domestic inflammation of gas before the export is not what is being done now
1293504 nigeria is so blessed so rich people are suffering we are flaring gas throwing it away as if it doesnt have meaning we are losing approximately im not lying we are losing over 15 million a day on flaring when we are giving these people license why didnt we insist that there must be no flaring other countries have done it
1293505 the gas master plan as you know is proposing to have three hubs in the entire country we want to look at the dynamics of having only three hubs and not having more than that and where and where are all those gas coming from
1293506 it does not belong to only one stakeholder it has to be all the stakeholders
1293507 we are going to review the gas master plan the bottom line is we are going to review the gas master plan
1293508 we believe that the ministry of energy gas they have had a road show
1293509 so as to learn first hand how to manage emergency situation
1293510 we are in a very problematic situation today especially the israeli embassies abroad because of the threats that we got from the terrorist organisation the hezbollah to strike israeli embassies in west africa
1293511 though they did not speak about a specific country but there is intelligence and information that speak about this possibility
1293512 are also aware and they are doing all in their power to ensure that anything doesnt go wrong
1293513 the first thing that is very important to us is for you to be informed and assist us to protect this place and to give us information
1293514 this is the reason that we need maximum help from your men to help in this situation
1293515 i mean we got the reports yesterday and it is retaliation for the murder of one of the hezbollah big operators the ahmoniyah which happened in february
1293516 i would like to seize this opportunity of course we will discuss it more at length in respect to our security here i mean whatever we need from your organisation is always unbelievable
1293517 my security officer and myself we are very happy we are very happy we feel that the level of security provided by the nigerian police at the embassy is satisfactory
1293518 i myself i feel very confident here and i think that in a situation where the political or global situation all over the world with a lot of threats in our hands what to do israel has been exposed and is still being exposed to all kinds of threats
1293519 the purpose of my coming is to find out what is the security needs of the embassy if there are some shortcomings on the part of the nigeria police force to see how we can put those shortcomings straight tighten the loose ends and ensure that we provide you with adequate security
1293520 if julius berger could decide to pull out of the niger delta region because of the alleged disturbances by the youths one expected that such decision should be taken with the recent happening in abuja
1293521 in line with their policy of withdrawing from areas of harassment in nigeria this should not be a difficult directive after the incident on friday august 01 2008 when one of its vehicles was burnt by an irate mob in abuja
1293522 had this same scenario occurred in the niger delta region the army would have been called upon to open fire on the mob then brand them as militants
1293523 mend expects julius berger a company which has benefited tremendously from the niger delta region where its crude oil was used as barter payment in most cases for the building of abuja to apply the same policy of leaving troubled areas as it did when it recently quit the niger delta region
1293524 failure to vacate its staff from construction sites and halt all on going projects in the fct abuja on the deadline will result in unprecedented deadly attacks on the expatriate staff of julius berger inside abuja and other parts of the country until they comply
1293525 or we would be left with no option than to pay back which will be catastrophic
1293526 books acquire an arrogance through their sheer accumulation that at a point in the development of culture evoked the impression that libraries must contain everything suddenly the dust that covers the books becomes visible the air in the library is oppressive to breathe it is a sacrifice and to pass an entire life there is intolerable

1293546 shes down to earth never afraid to have fun and clearly not scared of early mornings he said
1293547 most of all she has a dynamite personality which we know australians love
1293548 this is a fantastic opportunity for fifi and were so excited for her ms davies said
1293549 fifi is incredibly talented and has a broad audience appeal we knew she would ultimately appear across many mediums nationally
1293550 but her role with seven means she cant continue to do breakfast radio and we just cant see the shebang without her bright personality
1293551 when fi told me she had been offered a job at sunrise i was really happy for her he said
1293552 unfortunately i knew it would mean the end of the shebang and ive decided to pursue other opportunities at the end of the year
1293553 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing mr stevens said after the meeting
1293554 our forecasts had the australian dollar reaching a peak of parity to the us dollar at the end of the september quarter before depreciating into year end mr grace said
1293555 we now believe the australian dollar has reached a peak early in the september quarter and will be adjusting our forecasts over coming days to reflect that view

1293557 although the fbi has no information indicating this individual is connected to specific terrorist activities the fbi would like to locate and question this individual
1293558 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqui is alive
1293559 she is injured but alive and she is in afghanistan
1293560 if shes in us custody they want to know where she is
1293561 who has got her and does she need medical care
1293562 we saw it on the news it was a surprise to us and the coaches
1293563 its a pretty bitter pill to swallow for the marlborough sub union
1293564 but were going to fight to the bitter end and the bitter end is hopefully a long way away
1293565 we wanted to stay under the radar but i guess that hasnt happened
1293566 to come back from that was a great result and the boys showed a lot of belief
1293567 weve kind of prepared as part of the process to be in it
1293568 she was obviously female and her age was obviously assessed at 40 to 45 years of age
1293569 youre looking at perhaps a european female wandering around the 1740s
1293570 which is much earlier than i understood there to be a european settlement
1293571 its possible that a group of explorers capsized and a body got washed up in new zealand
1293572 if that was going to be the case youd expected other sorts of evidence
1293573 there would have been oral evidence within the maori community thered be literary evidence people writing about it thered be other artefacts other skulls that were found none of those things have happened
1293574 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced

1293776 a nadie le gusta la guerra reconozco las tremendas dificultades de afganist n pero tanto a mi pa s como al de ustedes le interesa que la primera misi n de la otan fuera de las fronteras de europa sea un xito debemos hacer esto por el pueblo de afganist n y por nuestra seguridad conjunta estados unidos no puede hacerlo solo
1293777 me esposaron y me pusieron al sol durante tres horas despu s me levantaron y me hicieron caminar un rato y luego me dispararon cuando me di cuenta estaba en el piso me dijeron te vamos a disparar una bala de goma y nunca me imagin que fueran a hacer eso a abrir fuego contra m mientras estaba esposado
1293778 esta pol tica deber a ser condenada a nivel internacional mediante las organizaciones de derechos humanos y deber an ser castigados por un tribunal internacional y no por un tribunal israel a fin de cuentas liberar n a este oficial despu s de un mes o dos o un per odo de tiempo corto ante los medios estar encarcelado pero no en la realidad

1293783 la ausencia de mala intenci n invalida los cargos de tortura
1293784 estos documentos proporcionan m s pruebas si es que eran necesarias de que el departamento de justicia autoriz a la cia a torturar a los prisioneros a su cargo el departamento de justicia tergivers la ley y en algunos casos incluso la ignor para permitir que los interrogadores utilizaran m todos atroces que en una poca estados unidos consider cr menes de guerra

1293827 i am here from far away an alien not seen in the light of day elusive ill stalk your children at night and your people will pay for their short sight
1293828 suk told me that he heard hiroshima was destroyed in a single bomb but i know better anyway i will take this dirt to the top of the highest tower in america and fling it off making their lands infertile we will make our way to their land and fight an unseen war there are many japanese there willing to fight who have been enslaved and put into concentration camps american will pay
1293829 this is a 1 in 10 shot if we fail to land in the right place the mission will not succeed
1293830 if no one does anything then we are like slaves who will let insignificant foreign countries push us around if today is not the right day for take off then it is a good day to die
1293831 the winds show take us to american but if we get stuck in any of these vorteces
1293832 the winds will take us too far south or nowhere at all
1293833 if we were north on the mainland it would be different
1293834 remember what you told us before we must be elusive or the americans will be expecting us many bombs have already been sent from the mainland this factory was closed not more than a year and a half ago because some coward told them the empire of japan had surrendered to this tiny nation
1293835 i am here from far away an alien not seen in the light of day elusive ill stalk your children at night and your people will pay for their short sight
1293836 i had a dream last night and i heard it there

1293839 this balloon is state of the art when we get too low sand bags will drop automatically sending us back up i built this enclosure to float in case we run out of sandbags thus minimizing failure potential
1293840 yes i didnt want to say anything to worry the two of you but it looks bad we will be out of supplies in a week or so and there is no real land in sight and were going nowhere
1293841 and there is a storm brewing we may not make it to our goal
1293842 can we cut the wires and land in the water we could live on the small island and boat somewhere later
1293843 we would not survive hitting the water from this height the craft might though depending on how it enters the water
1293844 and the island is too small without more vegetation and animals we would die anyway if we stay in the balloon there is still a chance
1293845 no there is a very high chance it would explode completely and wed be dead
1293846 amp amp theres got to be some way we must land in the water and boat somewhere
1293847 if we stay calm we may get through this but otherwise we will not
1293848 hikarus dead what happened he must of died of asphyxiation no we went too high and the air was too thin
1293849 we must be too far south mexico maybe we can land there these people have no qualms with us
1293850 we are still too high to consider landing were going to have to ride it out
1293851 tie hikaru down so he doesnt fall out we can give him a proper buriel later
1293852 sir i dont know we cant know sir isnt that japanese
1293853 i think so but well let the linguists figure that out i am not about to speculate on firing up another war with the japanese unless this is for real
1293854 good god this is awful tell your men to deny this to the end and get all of it this incident is hereby classified all the way to the top im sure my superiors will agree
1293855 what if someone saw the balloon land from far away what should my men tell them
1293856 tell them it was a weather balloon dammit tell them it was a weather balloon
1293857 pick up all of it and i mean all of it this situation is now classified dont tell your wife family newspaper nobody we dont want to fire up fears or speculation of war unless this is for real and this was not nuclear if people think the japanese can nuke us there will be panic be on the look out for newspapers report em to anyone if they break absolute silence well shut em up

1293864 no sir this morning i was practicing my striking techniques on those delicious pill bugs in your garden

1293870 the unicorns were trying to teach the trolls how to play rugby
1293871 one troll was offended when a unicorn kept piercing the ball and running around with it on his horn and another became enraged when the corns told him hed be playing the hooker and a third troll didnt want to be the hookers prop he wanted to be the lock instead
1293872 the sheeps had no luck at all trying to referee
1293873 what we will do is simple we will break up the fight let everyone cool off for a bit then discuss to everyones understanding soon enough
1293874 just a little nibble promise i wont damage it much
1293875 well its the only one i have and im going mad trying to find out who gave it to me
1293876 yum never seen or tasted one like this before too bad you dont know where its from or who gave it to you but im sure youll find out some day best to just keep on living until then right where have you been lately weve missed you at the coffee shop a nice tall mocha would be the perfect thing to wash that down with care to join me
1293877 well i do have my duties to get to you know king and all
1293878 what after spending all day chasing a floral delivery you wont take a few minutes out to chat over a cup of coffee a girl might feel slighted
1293879 within two weeks i can tell you whether or not youve really got a problem
1293880 i sure hope you can mr wells ill pay you whatever it takes
1293881 mr wells i had been hoping that you could help me find out why my happy and content marriage has failed to include me lately
1293882 im afraid that will require my daily rate plus expenses plus phantom fees plus taxes
1293883 im sorry maam it seems that your suspicions about your husband and the sordid love triangle were correct after all
1293884 early on it was unique and different but as it became a global chain the standardisation made it lose some of that coolness and edginess it was quickly copied and lost its lustre
1293885 australia was never like that we were curious about it wed read about it it was something to try
1293886 but once tried i dont know that it offered a particularly fantastic or unique experience that wasnt offered by other chains
1293887 firstly its the product and the taste and secondly the place and the service
1293888 its much easier for the local store to differentiate itself as being local whereas starbucks had this slightly schizophrenic positioning where it wanted to be the global local store
1293889 the american seattle based coffee of starbucks was never going to resonate and penetrate australias very big coffee drinking community
1293890 theres no question starbucks in many ways is an admirable company
1293891 starbucks has done very well in international markets where there has not traditionally been a coffee drinking culture
1293892 starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that ive tried
1293893 its a stronger taste which i like its a unique experience and its renowned for being good which is why people love it
1293894 its okay but there are privately owned cafes that id rather go to
1293895 this whole big chain thing doesnt really do it for me the coffees pretty ordinary
1293896 were going to start recording in september and hopefully have the album out in january or february
1293897 we wrote a lot of colour it in four years ago so we dont want the new record to sound like that this one is less straight forward but still spirited
1293898 we havent been doing many gigs recently weve just been writing pretty solidly
1293899 i wasnt even too keen on doing this one but the boys get really bored so were doing a couple im just looking forward to getting the new record finished and then trying to persuade everyone that the newer songs are better than the old ones
1293900 hi im phil ive had a great life lots of kids and lived in a lunar cis hab so you know that outside of some aluminum silicates there aint nothing in me that wasnt meant to be my poetry is just inside the collagen bundles and although ive chosen to be configured as a lampshade extensive hours with jojoba oil leave me plenty capable of assuming other forms i am an excellent babysitter for children in need of backpacks
1293901 hey there im nina im a hot little piece of scapula looking for a long term partner im cute i wear well and im pre sculpted for buttons and lanyards let me help you tie one on okay sweetie
1293902 hi this is patrice i like ponies and rocket shows and my favorite endorphocreme flavor is nannybooboo

1293904 so youre talking to the dead are you little sister this stupid traditions made made you superstitious im afraid dont let father know that i told you this but i dont believe that anything survives after death ive decided to be an epicurean you shouldnt worry about all those old stories they are nonsense
1293905 but what about when our ancestors join us at these dinner
1293906 you dont mean you think the dead are literally there its symbolic a show of respect dont be an idiot
1293907 so just as you and your friends stand around apollodorus in the palaestra waiting for him to speak so i stand here waiting for you to tell me more
1293908 you would make a good politician if you were a man
1293909 you know how to flatter so since i am your rhetor what do you want to learn from me
1293910 if no one sees the shades of the dead then why are there so many stories about them homer tells about people meeting shades doesnt he
1293911 and as plato points out to us homer is full of lies
1293912 what about furies who comes to fathers dinner parties he often tells stories about meeting the dead
1293913 furies is nothing but a parasite who tells amusing stories so he can fill his belly with other peoples food the only people who see shades are either crazy or drunk
1293914 i didnt have any wine this morning before i saw that girl i must be crazy then
1293915 or maybe marcus just doesnt know what hes talking about
1293916 are you all right lucretia you arent going to faint again are you
1293917 im okay just stay here with me please and talk to me some more read some greek to me the part in homer when odysseus goes to the underworld
1293918 i must be somehow more clever that odysseus for he had to travel far to see the dead while i only go to the necropolis just outside the city walls
1293919 they can talk to you if you give them blood
1293920 thank you brother i think i will go to bed now i have had an eventful day
1293921 i may be able to find out things that few other people can
1293922 i am special i have to do certain things that other people shouldnt
1293923 ill put the body next to one of the cats
1293924 apollo himself told orestes to avenge his father by killing his mother clytemnestra but he still felt guilty about it and took responsibility for what he had done
1293925 my name is lucretia too i am your brothers great granddaughter i think
1293926 i didnt know what it was like when i was but now that i can think about it i know that it is cold and lonely and dark
1293927 so far it seems like there will be something else
1293928 i dont know i dont want to think about being dead please dont do this to me again
1293929 she was entirely unhelpful she has no idea whats coming and doesnt want to think about it no better than a living person really
1293930 we are not afraid to harm ourselves if we feel it is necessary like our great ancestress who killed herself to conquer shame
1293931 i dont think i wanted to die so much as to make them all sorry i wanted my father to have spent all that money on the stupid wedding for nothing i wanted to put them out to cause a stir to have some control for once
1293932 our criminal justice system just took a gigantic leap forward this is a proud day for mississippi
1293933 i think its totally unjustified and unfair and this matter will probably wind up in litigation
1293934 whatever the problems were hes done a lot of work and its going to be hard to find the people to do the autopsies he was doing
1293935 dr baden has said mississippi would be in chaos if we didnt have dr hayne
1293936 this is a man who works 20 hours a day to determine the cause and manner of death
1293937 is a heartening development because i think to the extent that office is sending a message the status quo is no longer acceptable
1293938 leaving it up to the prosecutors just hasnt been working

1293954 the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story
1293955 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues

1293958 these kinds of things happen in other parts of the world too and of course it will naturally have a psychological effect on tourists
1293959 but i think this is an individual incident at the same time there has been no fundamental change to the fact that we are basically a safe travel destination
1293960 i believe that through stepping up our work we can get the message across once again that china is safe and good value
1293961 we must release news in a timely way to ensure people know the real situation
1293962 we have made a brand new publicity film and we will increase work in this regard to put across the image that china is a safe destination
1293963 ich habe gelernt wie einfach es ist einen krieg anzufangen und wie schwer ihn zu stoppen

1294190 as with all unsolved murders this case remains open and subject to review a 50 000 reward from the charity crimestoppers still remains available for information leading to the arrest and conviction of jills murderer
1294191 we continue to appeal for any new information and keep an open mind in relation to this case
1294192 this investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999 by the mets internal review group the crown prosecution service criminal case review commission two senior independent treasury council and the court of appeal
1294193 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case

1294197 is it true that in england you considered handing over madeleines custody to a relative
1294198 did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughters disappearance
1294199 are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter
1294200 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1294201 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1294202 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
1294203 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong

1294227 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season
1294228 its just a shame that the most classless uneducated lowbrow fanbase in the league gets this sweep red wing fans dont deserve their team

1294253 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1294254 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1294255 it was a different experience for me but its good for the players to integrate with the fans
1294256 its not very often the fans get the chance to see us close up and get our autographs its brilliant for the kids especially and were happy to do it
1294257 it only happens once or twice a year but its brilliant because the kids are on their holidays and it gives them a chance to mingle with players
1294258 its always good to interact with fans because you get a feel for what they expect and what they think of you
1294259 its important for the players to know that if spending a few minutes talking to them and signing their shirts helps them to become footballers or successful in their lives then were pleased to do that
1294260 its good for us to have competition i would have liked to see him come in as well i have said all along that all the top teams have competition for places
1294261 we had it last year with myself and bostjan it was good and healthy it made him play well and it made me have to play well to get into the team
1294262 im sure there will be new players coming in again and it will be good for the club it lifts my game
1294263 i have had no problems so far so i am really pleased with that i havent had to miss a days training in pre season which i am delighted with
1294264 the main issue is not the moscow bar but the gangs of wolverhampton
1294265 if you close the bar they will just move somewhere else in the city we need to get these people off the streets the police obviously know these people why arent their houses being raided why arent they being arrested
1294266 dont get me wrong though its not the sort of place youd take your girlfriend but the real issue is not the bar its the gangs
1294267 there have only been two incidents of violence in the actual bar
1294268 one person was punched in the eye months ago and we prosecuted that person and assisted police if you compare our log with other bars in the city ours has far fewer incidents
1294269 i am not saying we have not been at fault
1294270 we have made mistakes but we have learnt and are learning from them i have a good working relationship with the police on the ground floor the ones that do the licensing checks etc and i will be working with them closely in the future
1294271 if the bar was that bad 200 people wouldnt go to it
1294272 i have five sisters and my niece works at the bar there is no way my sister would let her work there if it was dangerous

1294280 do you really think that being more responsible with our resources will cripple the economy
1294281 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1294282 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
1294283 we want to actually present perth as a city on the world map
1294284 melbourne attracted something like 60 000 international visitors for the commonwealth games we can do it
1294285 were spending large amounts of money hundreds of thousands of dollars giving ourselves the best facilities in the world
1294286 sports stadiums perth arena the replacement for perry lakes weve got the world sailing championships coming to perth lets get out there lets get positive
1294287 we intended to make this announcement this week irrespective of other events going on and have to get on with the business of government irrespective of whatever else is happening
1294288 people in western australia are paying for these new facilities i would have thought they would want to know what were going to do with them
1294289 when melbourne did theirs it was something like 700 million but a major part of that was upgrading their facilities were doing it anyway
1294290 i saw a picture of myself it looked like it was taken at blacktown station and then i didnt know what to do after that
1294291 i told my parents its not me please believe me
1294292 i told them that it wasnt me i told them to get more hard evidence but they said theyve got all the evidence that they needed thats it
1294293 i was about to break down i didnt know what to do
1294294 police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1294295 i had never been to a court before i was just so confused and shocked

1294317 not at this time but wed love to do it
1294318 i am going to predict once again that we will have a sea change i am really bullish honestly if i was going to start a linux business today it would be something on the desktop or a mobile device
1294319 the reason is that a laptop computer is going to be a couple of hundred bucks in a couple of years you are going to have fully functional laptops that are incredibly cheap intel and amd are building systems on a chip that is reducing the cost of building these kind of devices the highest cost items on these things is memory and storage so if you look at the world in the future of the 200 laptop linux is the only game in town
1294320 early successes will push microsoft to price compete but its not just the price that is going to make the difference but the fact that with linux you can tailor the experience for woman over 40 in asia for example
1294321 i think rather than embracing openness on the desktop side they will do the opposite they will retrench they will do anything to protect that microsoft office cash cow i mean that is their big monopoly in terms of really displaying monopoly price characteristics jesus that is an expensive suite of products
1294322 for me the biggest loser here is microsoft that is just a kick in the teeth for them i would not want to be in the windows mobile sales group now
1294323 the symbian move is a smart one but something they are going to have to overcome is that they are saddled with this old architecture that was designed for small handsets not for smartphones per se so they are a little more chained down and its going to take them some time to roll out the open platform get the governance model working get the foundation set up get the licences all cleared
1294324 it is going to be tough fight i think the android guys are going to come out with some really good handsets at christmas next year and i think google is extremely good at attracting new developers they have as buzz about them and a track record of developing killer development tools
1294325 the assumed reason for google to develop android is to keep that mobile computing world as open as possible so that companies like google can provide services paid search music downloads you name it and not have to go through an os vendor or a carrier nokia definitely has the same ambitions they want to be similar to apple when it comes to distributing music and entertainment and all these mobile vendors see that future and they all want to be there
1294326 well we support the kernel development effort and that is the one thing that all these developments have in common they all use the linux kernel so to the extent that we can provide forums to allow the groups to collaborate on technical issues at the core of their technology then we are out to do that as well as legal issues we have a forum for council from all these companies to come together to discuss the legal issues which has been a pretty popular forum for a lot of companies within the mobile linux and mobile industry in general
1294327 they seem to get some kind of bye you ever noticed that
1294328 but then the reality is that they just make killer products no one can argue that the iphone or the mac desktop experience is not a great experience
1294329 and when you kill a man youre a murderer kill many and your a conquerer kill them all youre a god

1294410 weve got a fantastically exciting line up this year bringing in creative and ground breaking work from all over the world
1294411 the programme features some of the very best deaf and disabled performers on earth
1294412 whether you have been interested in deaf and disability arts in the past or not now is the time to get interested
1294413 we have some acts who are already famous and those who are destined to be so
1294414 dadafests commitment to profiling innovative work has earned the festival superb recognition as a showcase for deaf and disability arts in our region
1294415 as a certified broadcast captioner and realtime writer who works with the deaf and hard of hearing community week in and week out i laud congresss passage of the higher education opportunity act with the inclusion of the training for realtime writers act language through my daily work i see firsthand the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing community and the difficulties that some in the community have in fully accessing communication having the opportunity to give back to the men and women in america who are hard of hearing has been one of my most rewarding achievements this funding will encourage more individuals to enter the realtime writing workforce and deliver positive changes to the 30 million americans who are deaf and hard of hearing on behalf of the officers and board of directors of the national court reporters association we thank congress and our congressional champions for moving this vital piece of legislation forward
1294416 with this passage of the higher education reauthorization bill congress is keeping its promise to the 30 million deaf and hard of hearing americans who have come to rely on captions as a means for communication access this service can only be provided by qualified stenographic realtime writers this critical funding will be truly instrumental in helping the captioning profession meet the growing demand for full access for the deaf and hard of hearing community
1294417 on behalf of the 23 000 members of the national court reporters association i sincerely commend congress for keeping its promise to all americans for full communication access
1294418 closed captioning is a vital service that provides the hard of hearing with the information they need in their day to day lives
1294419 although the law requires that all programming be captioned our nation still faces a serious shortage of captioners i hope that this funding will help alleviate that shortage
1294420 ensuring closed captioning is available for the hearing impaired is a fairness issue as well as a safety issue despite requiring 100 percent closed captioning we are educating only half the realtime writers we need to get it done i am pleased that this long overdue program will increase awareness and interest in careers in court reporting and realtime writing so we can preserve the integrity of the public record and make sure individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing can stay informed
1294421 i dont have any friends here i dont know anybody here everybodys hearing and im the only deaf person here
1294422 residential care facilities are not set up to have a deaf client
1294423 theres a lack of communication there its frustrating because you wonder how much he understands
1294424 im not like these people here im deaf but i dont have problems like these people do i feel pretty angry right now i just want to move i want to be out of here i would like to get a job i could clean the restrooms could clean windows could do a lot of work
1294425 because at least some of the staff are trying to communicate or deal with that situation
1294426 its not ideal but its been okay good for him because thats what there was
1294427 my real mom hit us and there was a water pipe that she had used and hit me on my back
1294428 even with the assistance of very skilled and qualified interpreters we were not equipped to meet sades therapeutic needs due to his deafness and the barriers that this represents in this hearing environment
1294429 this is a kid who really has had a lot of disruption in his life and being deaf makes it even more difficult to navigate through those difficulties and it would require some sort of specialized service to get his feet on the ground
1294430 it saddens me to think that sade has had to endure that for all these years and its saddening and frustrating to think that he hasnt been able to fulfill what he needs in life to fulfill and its no ones fault but the fault of the system i suppose
1294431 im aware of other individuals that are in similar or even worse situations than sade and the simple process of bringing those people together in a single apartment or home and having staff available to teach to them to become more independent to me it seems like a no brainer
1294432 i really want to move elsewhere its really boring here

1294440 we have a strong and sustainable business guided by a clear and consistent strategy and we enter the second half in good shape
1294441 however our markets are being affected by inflation high energy and commodity prices and the consequences of the slowdown in the west
1294442 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1294443 net borrowings provided by the bank of england have reduced to 17 5 billion pounds compared with 26 9 billion pounds at the end of december 2007 and are ahead of the business plan
1294444 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1294445 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1294446 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1294723 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
1294724 i guess its only newsworthy when a cancer doctor who hasnt done any of the research himself discovers it
1294725 i consider it alarmist premature and without any scientific basis
1294726 that may be due to the fact that so many of these studies have been done by scientists funded by the industry
1294727 the problem is that we still dont know and the science has been heavily politicized henry lai was never alarmist he just presented his findings and refused to budge from them
1294728 we thought they were collaborating and interested in the science

1294736 my mother was a flamenco artist in the san francisco bay area a very well known singer and dancer who had been ensconced in the scene there for years
1294737 i didnt really take it too seriously whatever your parents do natural rebellion sets in and you automatically reject it
1294738 the city donated its beautiful municipal flamenco center for our rehearsals i did a radio interview there was a lot of local interest
1294739 this is a chance for the public and presenters to see the show first
1294740 it came about as an idea in a conversation between us
1294741 it was about 10 years ago we were sitting in a rather sterile conference room in a sacramento office building
1294742 we got to talking and it came out that she had this ambition to create an international flamenco festival
1294743 i knew from working with flamenco artist maria benitez in 1990 that there was market for flamenco here wed proven that year after year and we were looking for a particular kind of idea that would work in the summer
1294744 i think it took hold there because it came at a time when there was nothing like it i agree that when you see irvine you dont think oh this would be a super place for a flamenco festival it was definitely a risky visionary idea on dougs part
1294745 but he went at it full force from a marketing perspective and it has sold out consistently year to year and its located near enough to the big cities that people will drive down from los angeles or up from san diego to see it
1294746 flamenco really reached a high point of popularity with the american public starting in the early 1990s
1294747 i think it has to do with the fact that flamenco artists realized they had to raise their production values if they were going to bring it to concert stages around the world
1294748 there was an era of very commercialized production in rock style arenas that generated a lot more interest in flamenco
1294749 our show is really harkening back to an era when flamenco was a little more raw theres going to be a lot of improvisation we left certain things very open in rehearsal when we get onstage well just let things happen according to the emotion of the moment audiences can feel that
1294750 its an interactive art form duende happens when artists are completely captured by their inspiration theyre involved in a very deep mysterious connection to their art it doesnt happen all the time not every night but when it does you never forget it

1294758 i have also mastered the art of jazz and tap dance and have been trained under the guidance of oscar fernandez
1294759 belly dancing involves muscle movements and breath control i realised that unlike other forms of dance that involve leg movements belly dancing was more about muscle control especially around the hip stomach and the chest the subtle movements of the hips stomach and chest make your muscles flexible it also involves breath control and is something very similar to pranayam i would say belly dancing is a wonderful form of exercise too in fact it has helped me cut down oodles of weight
1294760 i am an ace at karate sword fighting and kickboxing too
1294761 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue

1294815 hes a fantastic player and an important player for us
1294816 i hope he canscore a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times
1294817 weve only been training together for a few days so its not a lot of time but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games
1294818 the understanding between us and steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool
1294819 it was perfect to score my first goal because thats always important for strikers ive only been training for one week and so its understandable to feel tired

1294837 ein jahr nach der ver ffentlichung des motu proprio summorum pontificum durch das benedikt xvi die vorkonzili re liturgie freigegeben hat gibt es in frankreich wenige gesuche f r die feier der alten messe
1294838 es gibt etwa f nf oder sechs personen pro pfarrei die um die au erordentliche form der messe bitten

1294865 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1294866 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available

1294868 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude

1294963 apart from this abstraction desai offers her characters no possibility of growth or redemption though relieved by much humor the inheritance of loss may strike many readers as offering an unrelentingly bitter view but then as orhan pamuk wrote soon after 9 11 people in the west are scarcely aware of this overwhelming feeling of humiliation that is experienced by most of the worlds population which neither magical realistic novels that endow poverty and foolishness with charm nor the exoticism of popular travel literature manages to fathom this is the invisible emotional reality desai uncovers as she describes the lives of people fated to experience modern life as a continuous affront to their notions of order dignity and justice we do not need to agree with this vision in order to marvel at desais artistic power in expressing it
1294964 for me there was a real disconnect with the characters nobody told the truth the judge was mean spirited to the core and sai is irrelevant
1294965 i think sai just wanted someone to love her desperately i really thought it was interesting how in the end they are all together again its about family
1294966 there was such an overwhelming sense of responsibility for these characters to help each other they expected so much from each other i personally connected with the symbolism and think this book is beautifully written with exceptional prose
1294967 isnt it interesting how every culture has its own level of prejudice in india it is status social status it seemed that their struggles were all about becoming legal
1294968 i felt there was an ability to see another side of the characters except the judge he only loved his dog i think the vast minority of people have the ability to rise above their own circumstance saaed seemed to have the personality but still went nowhere
1294969 we dont realize how much we have how fortunate our children are to be afforded the opportunities they have in life for the characters in this book it is definitely about survival and expectation
1294970 wed tried pepsi and virgin cola and various others too
1294971 but they werent really a positive alternative they were acceptable but they werent coke and people really want coke
1294972 given that most of the cubes customers come because they like the places diy attitude
1294973 one way of doing that was to make the cola ourselves
1294974 the talks were on today yesterday after they resumed on sunday
1294975 we should take note of the fact that the parties took five days off last week to discuss with their principals so logically there is no way they will meet their original deadline if you take that into consideration
1294976 that shows progress and the three parties have a lot of work to do there must be accommodation and sincerity in the spirit enunciated by the principals at the signing of the memorandum of understanding
1294977 the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda it is quite encouraging that zimbabweans are coming together under the auspices of a brotherly country and neighbour south africa the omen is very good
1294978 it is our hope that in a few days to come the negotiators would have reached some decision of some sort the extension is an indication of progress
1294979 the bank will bring more peace to acholi the people who bank in it cannot again allow instability in the district they will fight to protect it
1294980 the present laws relating to separation of couples and termination of marriage are inadequate to respond to the myriad causes offailed marriages particularly the remedies of declaration of nullity and annulment do not cover the problems that occur during the existence of marriage legal separation on the other hand while covering problems during marriage does not put an end to marriage
1294981 though both divorce and a declaration of nullity of a marriage allow the spouses to remarry the two remedies differ in concept and basis
1294982 in annulment the marriage of the parties is declared defective from the beginning albeit it is considered valid until annulled
1294983 since august 3 1988 couples have been given a way out of failed marriages through article 36 of the family code the remedy provided under article 36 is declaration of nullity of the marriage
1294984 leave class early if you dont want to get punched in the face
1294985 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1294986 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit
1294987 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1294988 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1294989 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things

1295036 decidimos suspender las medidas de fuerza por dos semanas hasta el 15 de agosto inclusive como consecuencia de que comenzamos las negociaciones esta semana para discutir los puntos que no contempla el aumento que se otorgo al sector de los profesionales de la salud para esta semana tenemos pautada otra reuni n a n no sabemos bien qu d a por lo que estamos esperanzados comenzando este camino de negociaci n

1295039 los 21 millones alcanzan para dar el 24 por ciento de bolsillo a todo el escalaf n docente con nuestra proyecci n aunque tengamos que resignar dinero porque no ser a ese porcentaje al b sico como nosotros votamos en las bases lo que s se necesita es que la grilla que propusimos que absorbe los 21 millones la vea el gobierno y se siente a homologarla para lo cual tuvieron todas las vacaciones
1295040 ellos lo nico que hicieron fue ofrecer los 21 millones y siempre presentaron montos porque creemos que no quieren hablar de la cantidad de docentes ni de escalaf n porque seg n datos de los paritarios de c ccaro ellos en alusi n a los actuales funcionarios de gobierno no quieren blanquear 45 mil horas que est n fuera del sistema educativo con las que se pagan a funcionarios y a otra gente que no es docente hay un mont n de cuestiones que entorpecen un acuerdo marco donde est n declarados todos los cargos de los docentes y todas las horas c tedras este es un tema que ning n gobierno quiso tocar
1295041 el presupuesto educativo es millonario pero ah es de donde sacan a dos manos dinero que no es para edificios que no es para material did ctico ni para salario docente
1295042 la legislatura ni los otros partidos se pronunciaron sobre la educaci n y si hoy estamos as es por el robo de los otros gobiernos no nos olvidemos del pasado
1295043 cuando el dinero deb a haber salido del presupuesto de salud
1295044 se sacan algunos tems del presupuesto de educaci n para pagar cosas que se hacen en otros ministerios
1295045 el gobierno no quiere sentarse a blanquear la grilla salarial porque eso implicar a blanquear tambi n las horas y cargos de todo el sistema

1295048 un di logo en armon a para que discutamos esa redistribuci n de los 21 millones que ofrecimos como monto m ximo
1295049 por la gente de planta de la direcci n general haberes que concluy con que la aplicaci n de la contraoferta del sutef implicar a una erogaci n de 30 475 020 68 y no de 20 843 455 17 como ellos mismos hab a aceptado p blicamente
1295050 entre la grilla del gobierno y la del sutef hay un 40 por ciento de diferencia
1295051 no es cierto lo que dice la c pula sindical cuando plante que las cifras de ambas partes estaban bastante cercanas
1295052 ac hay una diferencia de much sima plata que es imposible de cubrir para las arcas del estado
1295053 esto es crucial que lo sepan los docentes de cada una de las escuelas para que definan si los n meros que maneja el sutef son los que ellos consideran prudente para arribar aun acuerdo
1295054 pareciera que la c pula del sutef no quiere acordar nada y mantener un conflicto por tiempo indeterminado
1295055 el ministro de educaci n les envi el informe de haberes e inclusive aclar ndoles m s las cosas a trav s de un cuadro comparativo porque adem s de los 9 6 millones de pesos de m s se les observa que en el art culo 1 del decreto 952 dec a taxativamente que el aumento que se otorgaba entonces ser a rediscutido y en la propuesta oficial del 28 de julio se remarc que esa norma quedaba absorbida en esta nueva oferta
1295056 pero parece que los dirigentes del sutef no consideraron esto a pesar de que como ellos quer an tantas aclaraciones nosotros pusimos un p rrafo espec fico dedicado a aclarar este asunto
1295057 a que nos sentemos a dialogar y discutir la redistribuci n de los 21 millones de pesos si realmente estaban de acuerdo con este monto
1295058 a estas alturas ya hay un conflicto que no se entiende porque comenz con un reclamo del 24 por ciento para todo el escalaf n interpretando err neamente lo que se hab a firmado a nivel nacional y luego se asegur que con 21 millones se pod a acordar siempre y cuando sea distribuido como ped a el gremio
1295059 pero hoy analizamos la grilla que nos elevaron desde el sutef y los propios empleados de planta de haberes determinaron que hay una diferencia de 9 6 millones de pesos
1295060 a todos los docentes de la provincia a que reflexionen y tengan en cuenta el esfuerzo important simo que hicimos para ofrecer este monto y destrabar el conflicto para que no persistan en su postura que cada vez se torna m s incomprensible
1295061 ojal se pueda en un marco de armon a dialogar con el sutef u comenzar a salvar las diferencias

1295074 ich bin froh dass endlich die richtigen schritte gesetzt wurden um die situation der pflegebed rftigen und deren angeh rigen zu verbessern

1295077 seit m rz 2008 besteht die m glichkeit nicht bezahlte ausl ndische verkehrsstrafen von sterreichischen autofahrern durch sterreichische beh rden eintreiben zu lassen allerdings ist grundvoraussetzung f r die strafvollstreckung dass jeweils zwei involvierte l nder ort der verkehrs bertretung wohnort des fahrers die gesetzlichen m glichkeiten zur zwangsweisen eintreibung von geldstrafen geschaffen haben
1295078 bekommt man von einem der brigen 17 l nder einen strafzettel nach hause geschickt sollte man ihn trotzdem nicht sorglos wegwerfen
1295079 in italien beispielsweise k nnen sich die strafen binnen k rzester zeit sogar verdoppeln wenn man der zahlungsaufforderung nicht nachkommt dann muss man f r z b das unerlaubte befahren einer busspur immerhin 170 euro bezahlen
1295080 es gibt f r die italiener derzeit keine rechtliche grundlage um in sterreich strafen einzutreiben will man allerdings wieder in unser s dliches nachbarland reisen ist es ratsam diese strafen sofern sie gerechtfertigt sind zu bezahlen
1295081 erst einmal sofort berpr fen wann das delikt begangen wurde

1295085 auf ausbau leistbarkeit und sterreichweit neue einheitliche tarife bei der mobilen pflege sollte besonderes augenmerk gelegt werden es ist nicht verst ndlich warum jeder sterreicher dieselben abgaben bezahlt jedoch kostenbeitr ge f r mobile pflege und station re betreuung unterschiedlich sind nimmt man in der steiermark einen mobilen pflegedienst in anspruch so zahlt man das doppelte wie in ober sterreich

1295208 people universally tend to think that happiness is a stroke of luck something that will maybe descend upon you like fine weather if youre fortunate enough but thats not how happiness works happiness is the consequence of personal effort you fight for it strive for it insist upon it and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it you have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings
1295209 when you sense a faint potentiality for happiness after such dark times you must grab on to the ankles of that happiness and not let go until it drags you face first out of the dirt this is not selfishness but obligation you were given life it is your duty and also your entitlement as a human being to find something beautiful within life no matter how slight

1295303 i personally dont think we should have a prohibition on early abortion because i think if you cant enforce it then overall it does more harm than good
1295304 but canada is unique in the western world for having no prohibition on abortion at all you can have an abortion the day before you give birth in canada and that is perfectly legal
1295305 i think the way people think its other peoples problem and as long as it doesnt affect them personally theres not much action on that

1295311 none of the discussion that is taking place about wait times and access to medical procedures like cancer treatments or hip replacements is going on about abortion
1295312 but it is a problem for many low income women or immigrants or students who may not have access to the services they need
1295313 and if no one is doing anything to improve access
1295314 you dont decide who is a human being by listening to a judge or a government
1295315 twenty years after a landmark ruling that gave women more rights to have abortions the issue remains contentious

1295331 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1295332 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1295333 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1295334 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1295345 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1295346 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

1295376 curioso per aggiunge andrea emiliani grande esperto di guido reni dei carracci e del seicento emiliano gi soprintendente della pinacoteca di bologna che sia stata emendata la verit un simbolo gi occorre una bella resistenza morale per scegliere proprio quel simbolo con tutto ci che la gente pensa oggi dei politici ai miei occhi pare una comica la riproduzione era stata scelta come allusione governativa in bella vista accanto ai ministri e poi arrivato quel reggipetto non viene da sorridere pensando a quante cose vengono messe in mostra a canale 5

1295379 sono in tanti che vengono con la scusa del setto ma che in realt pretendono di correggere i tratti che identificano la loro nazionalit

1295385 un viaggio con il mio amico simoncelli un altro che tira di scherma ndr che avevamo programmato dopo marzo quando pur essendo il numero sei del mondo ho saputo che non sarei andato alle olimpiadi
1295386 basta con questa storia gli ho scritto un messaggio gli ho detto che capisco il suo momento difficile che ci sto male anchio
1295387 io non credo che lui abbia preso il doping lui uno dei pi forti e nel nostro sport serve davvero a poco il fisico certo conta ma fino a un certo punto e noi non dobbiamo mai arrivare allestremo
1295388 quindi se lui non lha preso e tu ovviamente non glielhai dato cosa pu essere successo
1295389 non lo so non trovo risposte so solo che mi ero rassegnato da marzo che avevo gi pagato il viaggio in canada e che adesso mi ritrovo qui mi dispiace per lui ma trovo orribile che si possa solo pensare che io centri qualcosa e adesso devo anche pensare alle gare
1295390 no no abbiamo tirato bene abbiamo vinto il titolo vincendo facile la finale baldini mi sembrava normale normalissimo

1295395 dopo tanti anni sono quasi stufo di scherma mi prenderei una pausa proverei a mettere in pratica qualche progetto intanto vorrei imparare bene linglese
1295396 se i cinesi non li aiutano troppo gli arbitri si pu fare
1295397 posso perdere al primo turno o andare fino in fondo insiste cassar ma intanto limportante esserci e la sfilata inaugurale non me la toglie nessuno

1295595 the ioc would be delighted to see a british football team participating in the olympic games
1295596 we are hopeful that a solution will be worked out between the national associations the boa and fifa for london 2012
1295597 as the fifa president has stated on several occasions a british olympic football team would not affect at all the privileges of the four british associations as members of fifa
1295598 if you start to put together a combined team for the olympics the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team
1295599 if this is the case then why the hell do they have four associations and four votes and their own vice presidency
1295600 this will put into question all the privileges that the british associations have been given by the congress in 1946
1295601 we always said we had an open mind about it on the proviso that there would be some kind of meaningful statement from fifa
1295602 that hasnt happened so lord moynihan can huff and puff as much as he likes
1295603 i had assumed the boa would respect our position but that doesnt seem to be the case whats the point of cobbling together a team for a one off event
1295604 and its fair to say that i dont think its very helpful for us to hear all this through the media
1295605 we have a board who have looked at it and the vote was that we dont want to take part
1295606 football is autonomous for the home nations we have our own leagues and our own international teams
1295607 the olympics is not a major football event but people might use it to tell us we have to compete as great britain in other tournaments
1295608 we remain totally opposed to any welsh involvement in a great britain side at the olympics
1295609 the fa is in favour of a gb football team for the london olympics in 2012
1295610 as hosts a gb team would automatically qualify for the competition and we feel it is very important to take part when the games are in our own country ideally wed like to be part of a team represented by all four home nations
1295611 boa chief simon clegg is in beijing but he will treat this as one of his priorities when he returns

1295623 interestingly its at this very intersection of issues that cloud computing appears especially compelling by offering easy access to more efficient it capabilities across computing storage and applications while providing direct and immediate access to both external innovation and innovation capability cloud computing offers an on demand scalable and repeatable resource that can be used the solve two of the major challenges facing it departments today well see in a moment how cloud computing can help with these issues in ways that traditional on premises computing is hard pressed to match
1295624 for almost ten years now we have been witnessing a decisive shift from client server software to software as a service google ebay and amazon com established the value of multi tenant internet applications in the consumer market and salesforce com google and others have been proving that this same multi tenant model is winning in the enterprise as well
1295625 this shift to web based applications has generated two powerful waves so far now we are seeing a third wave one that we are calling web 3 0 and it may prove to be the most significant and disruptive yet to the traditional software industry while the world doesnt need another buzzword i feel that both the emerging generation of entrepreneurs and developers as well as traditional software isvs need to grasp the enormity of web 3 0 and its potential to create change disruption and opportunity web 3 0 is about replacing existing software platforms with a new generation of platforms as a service
1295626 web 3 0 changes all of this by completely disrupting the technology and economics of the traditional software industry the new rallying cry of web 3 0 is that anyone can innovate anywhere code is written collaborated on debugged tested deployed and run in the cloud when innovation is untethered from the time and capital constraints of infrastructure it can truly flourish
1295627 certain web 2 0 functions may be accorded a relatively healthy spending priority

1295634 the other had some skin disease and had white patches on her thighs we went to many doctors but they could not cure it like her sister she found it hard to get married so i had to dedicate her too
1295635 but how could you do that when you were so angry with your own mother for dedicating you you just said yourself this is undignified work

1295646 wahai orang orang beriman apabila kalian hendak mengerjakan shalat maka basuhlah muka dan tangan kalian sampai ke siku kemudian sapulah kepala kalian dan basuhlah kaki kalian sampai pada kedua mata kaki
1295647 allah tidak akan menerima shalat seseorang di antara kalian apabila kalian berhadast sehingga dia berwudhu
1295648 aku pernah mendengar kekasihku shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda kemilau cahaya seorang mukmin kelak pada hari kiamat sesuai dengan batas basuhan wudhunya
1295649 sungguh umatku kelak akan datang pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan muka dankedua tangannya kemilau bercahaya karena bekas wudhu
1295650 maukah kalian aku beritahukan tentang sesuatu yang dengannya allah akanmenghapuskan dosa dosa kalian dan meninggikan derajat kalian
1295651 yaitu dengan menyempurnakan wudhu dari hal hal yang bersifat makruh banyak melangkah menuju masjid dan menunggu waktu shalat setelah shalat tahiyatul masjid yang demikian itu adalah ikatan perjanjian
1295652 barangsiapa wudhu secara sempurna maka dosa dosanya akan gugur dari jasadnya hingga keluar juga dari bawah kukunya
1295653 apabila seorang hamba berwudhu lalu berkumur maka dikeluarkanlah dihapuskan kesalahan kesalahan itu dari mulutnya apabila ia memasukkan air ke rongga hidung maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari hidungnya apabila ia membasuh wajahnya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah ia perbuat dengan wajahnya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi keluar dari bawah tempat tumbuhnya rambut dari kedua matanya apabila ia membasuh kedua tangannya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari kedua tangannya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi dari bawah celah kukunya apabila ia mengusap kepalanya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari kepalanya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan itu keluar dari kedua telinganya apabila membasuh kedua kakinya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan tersebut dari kedua kakinya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi dari bawah kuku kuku kedua kakinya kemudian perjalanannya ke masjid dan shalatnya merupakan nilai ibadah tersendiri baginya
1295654 tidaklah seseorang dari kalian berwudhu secara sempurna lalu mengucapkan asy hadu allaa ilaha illallooh wahduu laa syarika lah wa asy hadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rosuuluh aku bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah kecuali allah semata yang tiada sekutu bagi nya dan bahwa muhammad adalah hamba dan utusan nya melainkan kelak akan dibukakan untuknya 8 pintu syurga yang kepadanya dipersilakan untuk masuk melalui pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
1295655 aku pernah melihat rasulullah berwudhu seperti wudhuku ini lalu beliau bersabda barangsiapa berwudhu seperti wudhuku ini niscaya dosa dosanya yang telah berlalu akan diampuni sementara shalat sunnahnya dan perjalanan menuju masjid menjadi penyempurna bagi dihapuskannya dosa dosanya

1295661 all those who come to britain must play by the rules it is right that foreign students wanting to take advantage of our world class universities and colleges must meet strict criteria
1295662 by locking people to one identity with id cards alongside a tough new sponsorship system we will know exactly who is coming here to study and crack down on bogus colleges
1295663 i welcome the education sectors involvement in developing a structure that allows international students to benefit from the excellent educational experience the uk offers while giving them the opportunity to work in the uk for two years following graduation
1295664 however i will not tolerate the minority of individuals who seek to damage the quality of our education system through bogus colleges this is why we have introduced tighter checks to the current register of education and training providers the new system will toughen this process further and give extra protection from the damage bogus colleges can cause
1295665 i feel most people should respect other peoples cultures there is definitely something worth preserving
1295666 admittedly we have lost a lot of our language but if we dont keep working on it we could end up with virtually nothing left
1295667 with the work that the agency is doing hopefully ulster scots is making a comeback
1295668 we need to see what various people through the ulster scots community have to say regarding that implementation group and how the academy would work
1295669 i think there will be support for it given the considerable public sector support for the irish language over recent years i dont think there will be people who will now quibble if ulster scots is getting similar funding

1295673 we are looking very closely at hospitals which have already experienced serious outbreaks of this condition and were looking at what theyve done and put in place to reduce their numbers
1295674 we have actually brought over a team from england called the safer cleaner hospitals team to tell us about what approaches are being used and are having good success in great britain

1295815 high river has been successful in accumulating an impressive portfolio of precious metal assets both in production and in the advanced exploration phase
1295816 the recent announcement by high river of the agreement to acquire the remaining 50 per cent interest in the prognoz silver project is a very important development as it will provide the company with a high profile project that with the funding in place can be aggressively moved towards development and turn the company into a major silver producer

1295908 d amp h is always working to deliver innovative networking products to its resellers
1295909 we want to help those resellers assemble better solutions ones that create more effective ways for their end users to conduct business rhub has a strong solution that will let vars help their smb customers build more sophisticated communication infrastructures
1295910 the primary factor driving rhubs reseller channel expansion is to reach the small and medium size resellers who support their customers remotely
1295911 turbomeeting helps resellers improve customer satisfaction and enhances their ability to demonstrate products while driving down costs
1295912 fueling this growth is the expansion of web conferences beyond scheduled to ad hoc meetings
1295913 this requires users to have access to a web conferencing resource that is on tap at all times with little to no incremental cost per use rhubs turbomeeting fits this model well

1295917 we turn that around to develop mobile applications that fit to the business our applications are device independent too so our customers can avoid be locked into one hardware vendor
1295918 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests
1295919 sheen and petersen are at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do
1295920 youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1295921 when we first started there werent any bands that sounded like us because we were a bit different
1295922 theres millions of bands that can get into the top 10 now and at the time it was impossible to get into the top 10
1295923 so we wanted to lead the way again and not follow
1295924 it sounds like the suns shining its the afternoon and youre getting ready to go out disco dancing
1295925 we recorded it in london it was sunny and we wrote stuff extremely quickly hopefully it sounds like how it was made and it was supposed to sound quick and off the cuff and happy and upbeat and wide
1295926 and weve travelled everywhere in the world as well you cant help but want to expand your sound
1295927 a lot more vocals more stacks of vocals and not just one direct voice
1295928 we wanted to be happy with what we were doing and not sound like theres a lot of radio 1 indie and it all sounds pretty similar
1295929 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests
1295930 and we wanted to make something weird and fresh and radical that people would go yes i remember what its like to live again

1295933 it didnt feel like work it felt like making music
1295934 everyone wants to be his friend its a bit like school you know at school there was a kid who was pretty cool good looking good at homework sold loads of records that kid
1295935 if mark had put loads of trumpets all over this record it would have been the worst thing
1295936 he tried right at the end no its a kaiser chiefs record its not a mark ronson record
1295937 the idea of doing something to sell a record apart from writing really good songs is a little bit weird
1295938 i want people to remember the record as the one with the really good songs not the one that came in the inflatable packet with

1295956 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1295957 the incident took place at nayabans when deepak and his wife were returning after watching a movie
1295958 a heated argument took place between the auto driver and deepak when he refused to pay rs 12 instead of rs 10 auto fare
1295959 the auto rickshaw driver overcharged us he demanded rs 12 but we paid only rs 10 the reasonable fare following which a heated argument started between him
1295960 i was trying to resolve the issue but the driver took out a rod and hit on deepaks head he fell down and then the driver ran the auto over him in front of my eyes
1295961 we are investigating the whole matter the body has been sent for the postmortem and the report is awaited
1295962 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1295963 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1295964 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1295965 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1295966 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1295967 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1295968 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle
1295969 los montemarianos somos arraigados al territorio y muy luchadores nos convertimos en gente que ha podido recobrar las esperanzas despu s de creerlo todo perdido hastiados comenzamos a reconstruir el territorio desde sus din micas culturales utilizando la sabidur a propia del amor
1295970 una entereza que est acompa ada de una asimilaci n lenta del dolor acumulado nuestro reto es que ste no se vuelva rencor o venganza sino por el contrario que sea el pilar de la memoria de la comunidad
1295971 una compa era de colegio estaba desde hace un tiempo all y le ped que me llevara fue as como un 7 de abril del a o 2000 entr al colectivo participando en un taller de radio que estaba organizando el proyecto de comunicaci n para la infancia qued enamorada de este medio adem s todos nuestros tutores nos hac an sentir los seres m s importantes pues nosotros decid amos hasta los nombres de los programas los grandes eran s lo nuestros c mplices
1295972 al final do a lina no lleg pero se hicieron presentes personas que trabajan con ella en presidencia
1295973 expliqu a los presentes que no era posible tratar de pintar la imagen de un pueblo completamente avanzado con pol ticas p blicas adecuadas y muchas otras cosas que fueron totalmente opuestas al balance que se hab a hecho de la alcald a fue tal la rabia del alcalde por lo que dije que cuando se le invit a una reuni n que se estaba organizando en el colectivo el se or dijo que no ir a por que all ten an a una ni ita que siempre lo hac a quedar mal en todo
1295974 entre ellos estaba soraya bayuelo la directora del colectivo quien adem s es una periodista que siempre ha tenido la chispa encendida por la comunicaci n comunitaria despu s de unos meses se iniciaron labores con la casa de la cultura grabando los eventos del pueblo la comunidad estaba encantada con el trabajo
1295975 entonces se decidi comenzar en firme la formaci n en comunicaci n para ense arles a todos los chicos que sta es la nica manera de visualizar al otro de mostrarlo en todas sus facetas
1295976 por ejemplo hay mujeres desplazadas que empiezan talleres de radio y televisi n en sus comunidades pero cuando el colectivo va a comenzar a capacitarlas se da cuenta de que no saben leer y escribir es as como se gestiona un proceso de alfabetizaci n que les permite tener acceso a la educaci n que nunca recibieron
1295977 como ellas mismas lo han afirmado este proceso ha hecho que se sientan m s importantes que se olviden de muchas experiencias fuertes que vivieron en el pasado y ahora vean que son buenas para otras cosas
1295978 prueba de ello fue el primer festival montemariano de cine que se llev a cabo a finales de marzo en el marco de este evento se realiz la premier de 5 cortometrajes realizados por los j venes con estas cosas nos damos cuenta de que la educaci n hacia la paz no se lleva a cabo en las aulas sino en las mismas comunidades para que los chicos puedan mostrar y contar c mo quieren que sea su entorno y cotidianidad

1295981 el cine permite a las comunidades tener acceso a pel culas de calidad las cuales no podr an ver en otros espacios puesto que carmen de bol var no tiene teatros adem s crea identidad al mostrar los productos que la misma gente y los j venes producen pues emitirlos en una pantalla gigante los hace sentir protagonistas

1296014 there are a bunch of business opportunities in the internet however there is an equal amount of work at home scams to be cautious of if not careful you can quickly fall for a scam that will have you wasting a lot of time and even more money
1296015 it is vital that you take the time to research up on the company you will be dealing with prior to joining by knowing how successful they have been in the past and what kind of success people have had within the company you can get a better judgment of how you will fare
1296016 perhaps the most popular work at home scam on the internet is the myth of making money quick and easy there are so many mlm programs that claim you can make thousands of dollars in your first couple of weeks after two weeks and little to show for it most people end up quitting be cautious because there are very few if any businesses that you can make money easily in
1296017 out of all of the work at home scams on the internet multi level marketing is the most perplexing one the reason for this is because you can actually have success with mlm businesses if you do it correctly it is important that you get involved with a company that will truly help you recruit others otherwise you are stuck on the bottom with no way to make money
1296018 minimal progress has been made in adopting a more customer oriented crm based approach within the contact centre environment over the last 10 years when we compared this years findings with those from our inaugural 1997 report the picture is not positive
1296019 these findings indicate that the development of a more holistic and sophisticated approach to customer management is less of a priority than it was 10 years ago and there is a back to basics trend with contact centres focusing more on basic performance efficiencies and cost reduction
1296020 this is also reflected in the commercial drivers of contact centres only 16 of participating centres ranked creating direct customer relationships among their top three commercial drivers compared with over 50 10 years ago this underscores that there has been a major shift away from the tenets of crm over the last decade
1296021 this years survey confirms that when the basic service components are firmly in place customer service experience improves and client retention accelerates when we compared these service components to the level of priority or attention organisations place on them the results were enlightening
1296022 the choice of medium or channel was ranked among the lowest methods for customer service improvement less than 2 of participants selected this option in their top three choices for impact on customer satisfaction
1296023 taking into account that call resolution is the greatest indicator of customer service improvement we were surprised to learn that not all contact centres have aligned themselves to its measurement and targeting
1296024 contact centres still rely on the standard efficiency metrics abandon rate is the most commonly used target with 90 1 of participating centres using it as a key metric while only 63 4 of centres use first call resolution as a performance target these findings indicate a discrepancy between what customers want and what contact centres focus their costs and energy on
1296025 compared to last years benchmarking report these figures highlight the ongoing trend by organisations to reduce investment in training even though agent communication and service skills enhance customer satisfaction and the service experience

1296033 the ongoing doha round of world trade organisation wto talks is seen to be undermining regional integration and economic development efforts by african countries analysts have noted economist thembinkosi dlamini from the coordinating assembly of non governmental organisations cango said the negotiations currently going on in geneva switzerland undermined and compromised the efforts being made by the continent towards regional integration

1296121 what i believe was strictly true is that innumerable well observed facts were stored in the minds of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory which would receive them was sufficiently explained
1296122 practically every story of origin or foundational myth states that society was founded upon a murder one has the same plot in the bible with cane genesis 4 or in livys account of the origins of rome mircea eliade talks about what he calls the creative murder which can be found in myths from the middle east as well as from china and beyond however so far as my work is concerned i am still accused of simply rehashing an old freudian idea it seems that some scholars arent able to see how overwhelming the evidence is why do so many scholars dismiss the founding murder as insanity instead of accepting it at least a hypothesis
1296123 according to hocart anthropological evidence is always indirect circumstantial like a clue in a detective story if we isolate these clues we cannot reach any final verdict but they are so numerous ubiquitous and consistent that any doubt disappears
1296124 h aving been converted by comparative evidence they set out to find direct evidence in order to confirm their deductions
1296125 shows that in the theory of evolution not only was the circumstantial evidence decisive but it also allowed the finding of the direct evidence which now seems essential the same thing happens with mimetic theory there is no direct evidence for the apparently fantastic claim that the foundational murder is real and universal
1296126 the real obstacle in the case of the mimetic theory hasnt simply been the incompleteness of the record but the unwillingness an inability of our world to question its own fundamental assumptions
1296127 the general ambition apart from a few exceptions was to show that christianity was a myth like any other in a way we could say that i renew that project however i do in reverse because i realize that it is christianity that reads mythology better than any anthropologist and allows us for the first time to unmask the mimetic mechanism and particularly the nature of the scapegoat murder
1296128 yes there cannot be any positivistic separation between observer and the object of observation we are all implicated in the mechanism the mimetic theory demands an existential understanding to be fully grasped
1296129 borrowing from freuds terminology i would say that the mimetic theory is a narcissistic wound it is a wound to narcissism per se for it shows that ones desire isnt as free as modern individualism would like it to be and it is also a wound to the traditional theories of culture for it clearly states that the beginnings of human culture were grounded in a founding murder
1296130 in this context conversion means accepting the mimetic nature of desire otherwise one would fall back on the old authentic inauthentic binary opposition which is the perspective of mimetic desire that hasnt been acknowledged as such the inauthentic person is the one who follows directives from others whereas the authentic is the person who desires autonomously we have already seen how misleading and illusory this sort of individualism is the only way to overcome it is through a conversion which ultimately leads to a revision of ones own religious belief
1296131 one of the reasons its so hard to present evidence is mimetic theory
1296132 the fact that evidence has been erased may work as a super proof a meta evidence because it shows the crucial importance of the element that has been erased if someone removes the traces of a murder it means he is strongly implicated in it im convinced that there is a real event which is hidden covered up traces of which are erased nonetheless in a freudian sense this erasing of the traces isnt itself without traces
1296133 the threat of overt self criticism that would bring about the collapse of the individual identity and its convictions
1296134 i think you are right because so much effort goes into preserving concepts such as individualism and the autonomy of desire
1296135 in sociobiological terms it has an extremely powerful adaptive value
1296136 i do believe in the truth of the text i do not think all texts are truthful but i believe exactly like freud that ritual necessarily imitates an event which actually occurred in its narrative myth necessarily distorts that same event but in such a way that the principle of the distortion can be discovered to say that i simply mistake ritual and myth for the truth is a gross simplification of my work im not talking about an absolute truth of the text and im only saying that there is something hidden in the text which refers to an actual event the scapegoat mechanism

1296191 hey they are black cut them some slack we are ashamed what our ancestors did to them we cant attack them for any comments they make they are oppressed for so many years they are a gift to this world
1296192 miss jones madame prime minister oh im useless at these things harriet can you hear me
1296193 mr copper you might lower your voice and avoid attracting unwanted attention from upstairs
1296194 yes im delighted too but i rather think we need to be a little less noisy
1296195 the barrier has encapsulated their blasts but the inertial blowback when i activated it caused the floor to collapse im so sorry id forgotten all about temporally kinetic energy dr sato did warn me and whats left of the floor is unstable i was worried more of it would come down on top of us
1296196 cant escape certain doom from outer space only to be done in by oak parquet i suppose i should be grateful it was only a two meter drop mr copper pardon my curiosity but have you dosed me with something i was in severe pain the last i remember and i dont seem to feel anything of the sort at the moment
1296197 i used dr satos scanner to confirm that you had no broken bones or internal injuries but you do have a badly bruised coccyx and a lot of contusions i thought you could do with a little relief
1296198 nothing youd know something from back home it should wear off completely in a few hours
1296199 ah well before that happens and while im feeling quite up to it would you mind telling me what on earth youre doing here in knaresborough werent you supposed to be someplace safe in cornwall i thought we agreed that we couldnt be in the same place at the same time not with the daleks about
1296200 quite right and i shouldnt have come here at all if id thought the original parameters of the plan were operative but they arent
1296201 if you dont mind maam i think we need to leave the premises
1296202 the time locks power source is only good for an hour or so at most and wed best be as far away as possible when it burns out
1296203 the time lock appears to have included your cellar door i had to go round and break the window next to your coal chute to get down here ill pay for the repairs of course
1296204 i think we can unbar the outer chute doors mr copper and that will give us egress but it leaves us in the open vulnerable to non immobilized daleks did you have a plan beyond this
1296205 i think youll find that the three daleks in your parlour are the last ones in england
1296206 and now mr copper i must insist that you explain yourself
1296207 firstly im afraid i had no intention of letting you go it alone with this subwave business
1296208 you see thats precisely why i didnt tell you this before
1296209 i knew youd object and we didnt have time to argue
1296210 you might not have gotten an argument out of me mr copper ah here we are
1296211 oh dear it really is filthy in here im sorry do go on
1296212 simply put i didnt want you to die you were invited to join the institute because you are everything our mission statement champions and we didnt want to lose you if there were any chance to protect you from these things these daleks then we were going to take it
1296213 the institute is small yet ill grant you that but that only made your safety more important dont you see
1296214 no not really youve mentioned doctor sato several times now will i be meeting him
1296215 her dr toshiko sato was a young lady she was formerly of torchwood and she was my first recruit she was just like you she met the institutes mission statement parameters we are men and women of honor good will and special resources willing to risk our lives to meet the universe on a peaceful footing
1296216 for now its enough to say that she provided me with a great deal of technological help setting up and provisioning our institute
1296217 she wanted to bring one of her team with her when she left for good but it didnt happen she was a lovely girl and i shall miss her a great deal
1296218 im sorry mr copper but where did dr satos device even figure into our plan
1296219 i didnt wish to lose another institute member and i knew when we decided to trigger the subwave network that youd be found and killed by the daleks i was preparing for my cornwall run worrying myself sick about your situation when it suddenly came to me the time lock device might protect you so i got it from my safe put it in the boot of the car and drove for hours got here as quickly as i could which was nearly too late
1296220 i got to knaresborough in time to see those three heading up your walk i got as close as i dared just feet outside your front door as a matter of fact and triggered it when they gave that dreadful exterminate war cry of theirs im grateful they did actually it gave me enough time to flip the switch and ensure that their shots were caught in the locked field
1296221 and i am ever so grateful that you could do so mr copper lets continue the conversation once were out of the house
1296222 does this mean were back where we belong that the doctor actually saved us
1296223 they began leaving shortly after i got on the road i imagine thats one of the reasons i wasnt stopped and exterminated myself i also think triggering the subwave network may have had something to do with it but i cant be certain
1296224 just before i got into town the planets started disappearing from the sky i almost drove off the road when that happened and the earth started moving literally moving miss jones i dont think i shall ever forget it aha here they are my keys would you care to accompany me back to institute headquarters
1296225 my home its just outside london wont take long to get there
1296226 oh dear the power must have failed but where are the daleks
1296227 i havent the slightest idea mr copper but i have no doubt that torchwood unit or perhaps the doctor himself will soon have far too much to say about it before we absolutely must hear their explanations might i bother you for a ride a guest bedroom and another dose of that marvelous painkiller
1296228 this is the opportunity to do this now that we have a method for delivering the game we should try and see if we can do it go all the way back to the retro style

1296230 why dont you make another one of these games why dont you bring this game back

1296232 well retro games seem to be what people want but people want a new mega man game they want another story but at the same time they also want the classic feel
1296233 are we up for this challenge maybe we can actually surprise the fans and deliver what they want this is what were going to do
1296234 as a council we are supporters of the mayors for peace initiative and the hiroshima nagasaki protocol is an important part of that process its goal of achieving a nuclear free world by 2020 is one i wholeheartedly support and im pleased to offer our support for this global campaign relying on weapons of mass destruction to keep the world a peaceful one is madness if we wish to safeguard future generations we need to take serious steps to rid the world of the appalling prospect of nuclear war

1296356 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1296357 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch
1296358 of your credit crunch its you who made it happen its you who caused the housing boom and bust which spiralled into this crisis
1296359 the optimistic case rests on the business world beyond finance
1296360 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1296361 no the cause is your attitude towards investment banking banks had to be monitored whereas you flooded the money market with free cash for them to invest into any kind of frankenstein product

1296365 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets it is essential that we do so
1296366 the remarkably strong performance of the world economy since the near universal adoption of market capitalism is testament to the benefits of increasing economic flexibility
1296367 increasing flexibility not complete ask to people in east asia about what happened in 1997 and see if the same happened to china china hasnt embraced this totalmarketmodel and yet it has bought out washington in 10 years
1296368 in reality the past decade has seen mounting global forces the international version of adam smiths invisible hand quietly displacing government control of economic affairs
1296369 since early this decade central banks have had to cede control of long term interest rates to global market forces previously heavily controlled economies such as china russia and india have embraced competitive markets in lieu of bureaucratic edict the danger is that some governments bedevilled by emerging inflationary forces will endeavour to reassert their grip on economic affairs if that becomes widespread globalisation could reverse at awesome cost
1296370 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1296371 china has slowed down a lot already but its going to slow down more
1296372 we must maintain steady relatively fast development and control excessive price rises as the priority tasks of macro adjustment
1296373 we have had to cut back on our own orders to our local suppliers of zippers nylon and polyester
1296374 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends

1296378 number one are our products likely to be open sourced no
1296379 we do provide our source code in special situations but open source also implies free free is inconsistent with paying for lunches at the partner conference applause with that said there are a number of different things will we interoperate with products that come from like linux from the open source world yes we will

1296389 i am tired of hearing about bickering among the capitals chefs in order to raise their profile and celebrity status
1296390 it is time for the profession to return to the kitchen and decide between food or fame or at least fame gained by cooking
1296391 a number of high profile chefs are behaving like spoilt divas who have lost sight of why they began to cook in the first place
1296392 petulant children do not ordinarily make the best chefs we need positive role models not attention seekers who manipulate the publics outlook
1296393 we hear nightmare stories of terrible work conditions it is even shown on tv and it is to my mind sadly glorified

1296400 i told him what he already knew of our profound differences on this subject
1296401 the tour is bigger than anything the band have done before
1296402 they will be on the road for more than a year possibly pushing 18 months
1296403 the dates could easily run into three figures and will take them around the world
1296404 it is on the kind of scale you would expect from the rolling stones the fellas who have hatched the plan are very proud and excited
1296405 such policy initiatives those concerning the earth summit scheduled to convene in brazil in june 1992 derive from highly uncertain scientific theories
1296406 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1296407 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1296408 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1296409 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
1296410 on obama s side much of the animus evaporated when clinton conceded
1296411 obama himself never suggested that the clintons had harbored racial animus
1296412 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1296413 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
1296414 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
1296415 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
1296416 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
1296417 the discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
1296418 with working memory youre just keeping it active until you use it
1296419 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
1296420 rats treated with estradiol are definitely a lot more active and make a lot more lever presses
1296421 women take them thinking theyll be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy and they might help hot flashes
1296422 in distressed and downtrodden neighborhoods homeownership is a catalyst for political participation and neighborhood revitalization
1296423 by engaging residents in local issues homeownership contributes to the re empowerment of urban communities

1296425 after the strong decrease of the arctic ice during the last summer climate scientists all around the world are constantly asked how will the ice develop in the next years
1296426 to answer this question we did not want to guess but to rely on sound calculations
1296427 through this we are still not able to make a definitive statement on sea ice cover in september this trick enables us to compute the bandwidth of possible ice covers and to quantify the probability of extreme events
1296428 it is a first test and all participating researchers are eager to know how their prognosis has fared at the end of the summer in the end this small competition serves the optimisation of our models so that we are able to improve our predictions concerning short term seasonal fluctuations it has to be added however that even perfect models would not be able to rule out a component of chance regarding the atmosphere these forecasts will always be about probability and not exact prognoses
1296429 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
1296430 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
1296431 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
1296432 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
1296433 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
1296434 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1296435 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1296436 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1296437 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1296438 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1296439 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1296440 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1296441 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1296442 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us

1296446 in terms of the accelerometer nice screen decent computer power yeah you could make games on it if steve jobs wanted to encourage more games to be made it will be interesting to see how that evolves
1296447 if it wasnt for steve jobs basically saying dont waste my time with games we would not have electronic arts
1296448 they sold a million iphones first week 12 million sold supposedly in the first generation there are a 100 million plus dses i dont think were quite there yet
1296449 the truth is steve jobs doesnt care about games this is going to be one of those things that i say something in an interview and it gets fed back to him and im on his shithead list for a while on that until he needs me to do something else there but i think that thats my general opinion hes not a gamer
1296450 its difficult to ask somebody to get behind something they dont really believe in i mean obviously he believes in the music and the itunes and that whole side of things and the media side of things and he gets it and he pushes it and they do wonderful things with that but hes not a gamer
1296451 what actually resonates having spent earlier parts of my life doing cell phone entertainment and voice entertainment there are very few examples of entertaining games that play to what the device is actually designed to do which is to promote voice personal communication of live emotion someone will figure that out

1296470 the metals are under a fair bit of pressure we are seeing the entire commodity complex drifting on the back of this fear of the global macro economic environment
1296471 in the short term all the metals look technically weak
1296472 while this is arguably a seasonal build up the dominant warrant holder in copper has failed to keep pace with rising inventory allowing its position to slip
1296473 it doesnt look very good out there we are beginning to see the job losses appearing as a result of the bad performances everywhere once job losses cut in things are quite serious

1296481 you want to be looking at the banks that have tended to do well against a u s slowdown or do well relative to other banks in asia when there is a slowdown within asia
1296482 against that backdrop the japanese banks have tended to do very poorly in terms of share performance relative to others in asia and we dont think it will be different this time around
1296483 in our view asset quality and credit cycle will be the biggest issue confronting asian banks in the second half of 2008 and 2009
1296484 growth is slowing input costs are rising borrowing costs are rising and currency moves are adverse which would mean margin compression

1296487 all of us that are going to be sophomores this year know how hard we have to work we have worked hard this summer trying to make sure it doesnt happen
1296488 our biggest concerns right now are power outages and street flooding
1296489 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1296490 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1296491 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1296492 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone

1296495 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone

1296509 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1296510 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1296511 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of

1296534 in my experience most entrepreneurs get the best support from other entrepreneurs not from advisers the budding entrepreneurs on dragons den can see how much value they would get out of a relationship with someone whos been there and done that
1296535 is it a betrayal of the cic concept i dont think that it is and i think the staff customers and the clients who pay the bills are all in a better position than they were the only people complaining about this are some of those who comment on social enterprises
1296536 we now have probably one of the least effective public sector procurement systems in the developed world hence all this smarter commissioning stuff were all being wheeled out to promote but its not enough this event sadly is like prescribing nurofen for a brain tumour

1296569 hell that would be like fusing french and english speak one or the other but jumping between both is not more efficient certainly not more effective
1296570 most people rarely learn one language well enough to speak it well when you add another language the crippled use whatever crutch holds them up
1296571 when it comes right down to it ignorance art and vanity all play into it
1296572 ignorance of what you dont understand and the vanity of trying to take what youve got and make art out of it its much more satisfying to make up your own message than to clearly understand the message you are basing yours upon
1296573 had there been a mario in her past that she had forgotten
1296574 mario mendez is a teacher in rio de janeiro he teaches both pilates and yoga and he says that they dont mix
1296575 mario talks about doing pilates to develop dynamic capacity doing yoga to develop static capacity when you mix the two you diminish the capacity of both when you do the two separately to enhance the capacity of each separately you end up with a greater combined capacity
1296576 he goes on to say that pilates and yoga are specific ideas each with their own target different ideas with different targets but both ideas making sense in the body in the mind and yielding functionality yielding greater capacity
1296577 no ekim met him on his travels and published an interview he did with him i think its still on the web if you go looking
1296578 no i mean all these people blending pilates into everything under the sun yoga is just one of a plethora of blenders theres yogelates aquilates dancalates golfalates the list is endless and growing every day
1296579 like i said yesterday you swim upstream to find the source you swim past the mixers blenders and fusionists to find the pure language no spanglish comprendo
1296580 hiking shorts and shoes and what a comfy t shirt top we should be going up into the mountains for a hike instead of a talk on gyrologic
1296581 its too warm today for much else what a place this is
1296582 the wife of jeremys dean margaret suggested it said it was a totally boulder place to check out evidently back in the eighties when the mayor of dushanbe visited boulder he decided to send a tea house to its sister city
1296583 tajikistan everything is hand carved if youre into tea this is the place to be
1296584 after the way you bolted out of our yogelates class yesterday i felt maybe you were mad at me
1296585 no no it was nothing like that i was upset with the class and didnt want to talk about it
1296586 were you upset with me at the meeting the night before as well you left almost as abruptly after that as well
1296587 the other night i was trying to avoid your curiosity and yesterday i was trying to get away from my anger at somebody so abusing pilates by blending it into yoga
1296588 yes werent you dying to give me the third degree
1296589 didnt honey say that you two knew each other from attending a talk by ekim unroc and didnt she say he went surfing before he was lost
1296590 and didnt you say you stopped teaching pilates sold your studio and went off surfing somewhere
1296591 i didnt even know you knew ekim is there more to this story that i dont know about
1296592 oh honey im so sorry i didnt mean to make you uncomfortable
1296593 its okay its okay im just not ready to talk about it about him about us
1296594 and yesterday i was so wound up i couldnt talk because i just cant believe what has become of the method i so love
1296595 hold it just one minute james you were talking with james our james mr pilates james mr drop dead gorgeous james when did this happen how did this happen
1296596 well remember when you told me about talking with mandy
1296597 get out of here hold the phone the first time you met girlfriend youve been holding out on me
1296598 not really ive only seen him twice the first time was a few nights ago i want to win the trials badly all ive been getting hasnt been helping me prepare except actually working out with you i thought maybe he would teach me but mandy was right he refused well he refused but he did give me some pointers i left and that was it
1296599 last night i was so upset i had to vent i thought i could just go to bed and let it go i couldnt so i got up and went down to the studio he listened he helped me get a grip
1296600 and then we went and got something to eat at dennys
1296601 the trials are important to me he has helped me
1296602 come on dont be that way and everybody doesnt need to know okay youre my friend friends maintain confidences
1296603 i know or i wouldnt have shared them with you
1296604 the furnishings are so old world its like time stood still and were way back when
1296605 the one on the right is mandy the instructor i met in glenwood springs
1296606 fit like aerobics fit but believe me no notion of scoop
1296607 honey id like you to meet my friend tosh tosh honey
1296608 well we only met at ekims last talk but it was so profound for me you know and jen was there and i was there and like wow my whole pilates world opened up ekim told me to trust the idea to use it to share it and thats what ive been doing
1296609 oh after that i sold my equipment and went surfing
1296610 i heard thats what ekim did went off surfing until you know he was lost
1296611 the purpose of this meeting is to review the rules and how the judging works for the upcoming preliminaries that lead into the trials
1296612 if you havent already you can pick up a copy of the terms of participation and the release after the meeting
1296613 you have to be over 18 sign a waiver and pay the entrance fee in advance no late entries no take overs you get to participate in the preliminaries with no guarantee of making it to the trials a quorum from the university of pilates board of directors judges the preliminaries from there the participants in the trials judge themselves
1296614 are you saying that if you make it to the trials you get to be judges as well
1296615 well it goes back to a movie that ekim unroc saw called stick it it was a movie about gymnastics and pointed to the weakness of having judges evaluate athletes on personal bias rather on the merit of their movement most of the judges were never in their lifetimes able to perform the moves that they were judging in protest the lead character intentionally defaulted her performance influencing who ended up winning the event the structure so appealed to ekim that when he set up the trials he made it so that the participants judged themselves
1296616 doesnt that open the competition up for a lot of abuse
1296617 sure but ekim didnt care he always said that the idea of pilates will protect itself and in the time that we have been conducting the trials it seems to be the case
1296618 all the scores are public in this way participants get judged not only on their performance but on their judgement as well they may be a very good performer and a very poor judge or visa versa but that is rarely the case the better you can do it the better you can judge it
1296619 in past trials the results have been remarkable review the archives and see for yourself
1296620 so what will be the right way to breathe fog a mirror or percussive lips pursed or soft and what version of an exercise will be considered correct
1296621 it is true that there are many ways to breath and countless ways to approach the performance of each exercise from the view of ekim the beauty of pilates is its ideal nature so pilates isnt an arbitrary expression of movement or breathing one way isnt just as good or valid as the other there is an ideal target to the method so there has to be an ideal aim in which to hit the target
1296622 have you ever been taking a class and the instructor only acknowledged options without ever pointing to an ideal without ever saying that one way is better than another and how to reach for that i have and it confuses me makes me feel insecure if there is no right way how do i invest myself in any way
1296623 as weve discussed before contrology is the complete coordination of body mind and spirit ekim believed that is a state of being in the body in the moment of the doing all the archives of joes original work show the same exercises done in the same order it is towards that ideal that the trials are targeted your creativity can best be shown off by your purity of expression start adding your own stuff or changing the order around and you likely wont make it past the preliminaries
1296624 well how should we go from here what brand of pilates will get us best prepared to do well in the trials
1296625 in sun tzus book the art of war he stresses the point of know your enemy
1296626 theres a yogelates class im signed up for and i cant wait
1296627 its so good to see you again it will be just fab to work out with you tosh see you then

1296653 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
1296654 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

1296670 must be cognizant of the nature and requirements of the ccp have a high level of morality be able to act as a model for others be fully aware of potential dangers and threats to the party and be earnest and practical minded in serving the people and in staying away from corruption
1296671 we will not employ people who use their positions to pursue private gains and who are not trusted by the masses
1296672 ensuring the responsibility of regional leaders punishing those who have violated regulations relating to petitions upholding the proper order of the petition system upholding petitioners legal rights and promoting social harmony and stability
1296673 to minimize events that will disrupt social stability jeopardize safety during the olympics or hurt the national image
1296674 the grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid no government program can alter that fact someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma tvs the price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them one way or another rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset based consumption dependent economy will be finally discredited
1296675 decision to write off 90 of its us conduit loans
1296676 a us recession is now locked in but more alarmingly 55 loan losses point to the possibility of a depression
1296677 not only is something wrong with the dollar the banking system and the economy there almost literally is nothing right with any of them truth is that whistling noise you hear is the air streaming past your ears as we all plummet into the deepest economic abyss ever seen by mankind
1296678 what do our officials most fear they fear the publics loss of confidence events are driving their improvised attempts to stem a general loss of confidence in the dollar in them the financial and monetary system and the government as a whole
1296679 its ok now they cleared up the blast scene already im not worried
1296680 my colleagues said the scene was really awful lots of people rushed over to look and saw lots of police
1296681 the casualties arent that high i just drove there and had a look
1296682 of course it was absolutely carried out by the east turkestan pro independence group
1296683 since the early 1990s terrorist attacks have been the number one risk for olympic preparations and we are paying great attention to this issue
1296684 the danger of a terrorist attack directed at the olympic games has always been there we have made a comprehensive contingency plan for that
1296685 when i came to work this morning we felt the atmosphere was so tense because of the explosion we can go out now but all the streets are under police guard and people arent allowed to move around
1296686 sixteen people killed another 16 injured they are all armed police i heard that the suspects have been caught
1296687 we have a big gap here between the rich and the poor
1296688 there are some individuals who are pro independence stability is more important than economy here the uyghur people are not hostile to us
1296689 at the airport or on public buses all bags are subject to security checks
1296690 hundreds of armed police are patrolling the roads you cant even throw a piece of paper on the street
1296691 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington dc for you are a citizen of the united states
1296692 engaged in bizarre antics that your average zegna clad washington lobbyist would never have dreamed of
1296693 the hardline confrontational policy the united states has embraced under the bush administration has inadvertently demonstrated the limits of us power
1296694 the rejection of diplomacy has reduced the united states to a condition of self inflicted powerlessness regarding many problems
1296695 the vacuum is being filled in part by us adversaries iran syria hamas and hezbollah and in part by friendly arab regimes which seek to find a way forward in situations where us policy has contributed to stalemate
1296696 the new arab diplomacy not with the us and not against the us
1296697 many essentially friendly countries are openly willing to pursue policies the united states disapproves of presenting washington with a fait accompli and the choice of either openly criticizing the action of its so called allies or grudgingly tolerating it
1296698 t he united states has little leverage over the policies of even friendly countries
1296699 the government set up the truth commission tac in a bid to spur economic activities which slowed down after the crackdown on corruption suspects
1296700 corruption is everywhere in society and there are some people who were unwillingly involved in it
1296701 moreover the move to set up the commission will lessen the burden of the courts of law dealing with the corruption cases
1296702 it may bring respite immediately but it will not bring in any success in the long run
1296703 corruption increases the cost of transaction and the government ultimately needs to curb corruption and ensure good governance for a sound economy
1296704 the truth commission is the consequence of contradictions in the policy of the present government they apparently wanted to change the country without changing the policy framework so negotiations even with corrupt persons are a must
1296705 there is nothing to be optimistic or pessimistic about it i will just try to do my job and the end results will show whether the commission succeeds
1296706 the truth and accountability commission has been created to avert economic disaster he said
1296707 there is scope for discrimination as the commission is formed from certain groups of people
1296708 the government has formed the commission to help its own people to escape punishment
1296709 congressional authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to fannie mae and freddie mac
1296710 reconciled taiwans military posture chinas current military posture and strategy that indicates there is no pressing compelling need for at the moment arms sales to taiwan
1296711 the administration faithfully implements the taiwan relations act under which the united states makes available items necessary for taiwan to maintain a sufficient defense
1296712 is applicable for all us government agencies whether its the department of defense department of state or any other part of the us government
1296713 the passage of the procurement package is actually a matter of course since it has been approved by the us president its budget had been passed by the legislature and the relevant preparations are almost all in place
1296714 china now can afford an arms race with taiwan the islands economy will collapse first if it wants to lock in such a race with china
1296715 our real concern is us intervention should there be a military conflict across the taiwan strait given its small size no matter how many weapons it buys from the us the taiwanese military could hardly defend itself without the help of uncle sam
1296716 the us is well aware of the possibility that the technologies in weapons it sells to taiwan could pass to china sooner or later in one way or another so it never wants to sell its most advanced weapons to taiwan
1296717 policy makers in washington are not fools who certainly would have taken this possibility into consideration when they decide on what weapons to sell to taiwan
1296718 incluso esperamos que excedan en cierta medida nuestros objetivos originales ante la celebraci n de los juegos ol mpicos donde esperamos mostrar la fortaleza de nuestras marcas

1296722 ive never seen anything like this this team is unbelievable ive been around a long time but this is pretty excited
1296723 its unbelievable how we have a different guy step up for us this team doesnt ever give up we always think were in a game and we dont get intimidated by anybody were in this playoff race and everyone in here knows it
1296724 just great we just keep picking each other up the second half thats what weve been doing thats what winning teams do
1296725 furthermore as regional human rights courts have already recognized the right to freedom of expression is applicable not only to comfortable inoffensive or politically correct opinions but also to ideas that offend shock and disturb the constant confrontation of ideas even controversial ones is a stepping stone to vibrant democratic societies
1296726 not designed to protect belief systems from external or internal criticism
1296727 stressed the need to prevent the abuse of freedom of expression and the press for insulting islam and other divine religions calling upon member states to take all appropriate measures to consider all acts whatever they may be which defame islam as heinous acts that require punishment
1296728 operate as international anti blasphemy laws and provide international cover for domestic anti blasphemy laws which in practice empower ruling majorities against weak minorities and dissenters
1296729 the court has referred to the laws of other countries and to international authorities as instructive for its interpretation of the eighth amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments

1296737 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
1296738 do you really think that being more responsible with our resources will cripple the economy
1296739 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1296740 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
1296741 we were lucky as we are always looking for ways to improve the gardens and we managed to get some funding last year for the gazebo
1296742 it went up last august and we were thrilled with it so it is unfortunate that it has attracted the wrong sort of attention
1296743 i think we may not go to the expense of having the seats replaced as the feeling now is it might be better just left with the arches as a photo feature there are other public seats all around there
1296744 the gazebo was only put up last year at a cost of 6 000 and five iron seats that were made by a specialist firm in the north have been wrecked
1296745 it is nothing more than mindless vandalism and the area has had to be taped off on health and safety grounds
1296746 josh is so placid but i think its shaken him up as much as me
1296747 i am delighted and it was great to see the community really getting involved
1296748 we had young people and old people and a lot of teenagers working hard its absolutely fantastic
1296749 last year we had floods and we had the rain to contend with
1296750 but this competition is not just about plants and shrubs and visitors and views
1296751 its about how the villages are managed their ambience and the welcome they provide

1296755 he told me and my sister to hold my mothers legs he then raped my mother he moved up and down on my mother
1296756 he then went to my sister he said she must open her legs she said she cannot do that
1296757 first he raped my mother and he looked back and forth and afterwards he did it again we were still holding her legs
1296758 now i am not feeling very well its like this thing has just happened
1296759 i was forced to carry some of the remains of my siblings while waiting for the police to help
1296760 i called the police but they did not come so i did the next best thing which was to collect them myself because i could not leave them there
1296761 i took a taxi and went to the police station with the remains in a plastic bag i had to carry those remains while i was sent to and fro by the police before they could help me but i am grateful that they eventually helped me
1296762 i panicked when all their phones were on voicemail i was at my friends house and i had to call a taxi when i got there the police were picking up their remains i just fainted my brother sister friend and children were gone it was all too much for me
1296763 what saddens me is the people i lived with in that community wanted to beat me up instead of consoling me they wanted to know how i had survived
1296764 i dont know what to say or do i have completely lost my mind
1296765 it will take time for me to come to terms with their deaths and i dont want to go back there any more
1296766 all i can remember was that sipho came running home during the early hours of saturday morning and said that our home in cato crest was on fire
1296767 we panicked but managed to find someone with a car to take us there i cannot describe the pain i felt when i saw what once was my home down burnt to ashes and my family were a part of those ashes
1296768 lindiwe lost her nine year old daughter and 14 year old son she has been crying ever since and calls out their names at night
1296769 i dont know what else to do to console them anymore
1296770 i was so relieved when i heard the department of social development was going to help us with the funeral arrangements because we still have a lot on our minds and are still very confused
1296771 i believe that the police were still on their way but because he was still traumatised any waiting could seem very long
1296772 however we do prefer that police take peoples remains instead as we believe that they should be taken with respect and in a mortuary vehicle
1296773 we believe zytek automotive offers a fresh perspective in the way they use innovative solutions to do business in a financially successful and sustainable manner
1296774 he was quite a character he was a wonderful fellow
1296775 he could communicate with everybody he told the queen she was doing a fine job when he met her at the 300th anniversary celebrations of fort william
1296776 we cleaned out the house and sent many of the old pictures to dudley archives its a shame to just throw them away
1296777 my husband will be very upset to see it go as 60 years is a long time
1296778 a majority think house majority bill deweese should step down for his role in bonusgate
1296779 even though all those indicted in bonusgate were democrats three quarters say both parties are responsible for corruption in the state legislature three quarters say the legislature probably doesnt have the ability to pass the laws needed to fix itself but they want the governor to call a special session to tackle corruption in the capitol
1296780 negotiations are continuing but nothing is likely to be finalised until at least next summer when the area action plan for brierley hill is adopted
1296781 this will define details such as how much retail development is allowed in the area and will enable an informed decision to be made on whether or not we can make progress
1296782 a john lewis store at the merry hill would raise the profile and status of the centre no end
1296783 not only is it great news for shoppers all over the region but it will also bring a significant number of jobs
1296784 there is already competition between merry hill and rivals such as the bullring in birmingham but to secure a prestigious name like john lewis would be a massive coup
1296785 i walked past a man who was sitting talking on his mobile there were police officers on the platform and two seemed to almost follow me into the cafeteria they walked over to the man and wrestled him to the ground and arrested him it was really scary
1296786 i kept thinking about the fact i had been completely in the line of fire
1296787 it is too dangerous to demolish them in one go with explosives because they are too close to residential properties in the middle of the town

1296799 we had to walk away and were just in tears as we had been planning the wedding for 18 months

1296826 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
1296827 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
1296828 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
1296829 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours

1296843 ill stand out there in the rain storm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard
1296844 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1296845 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1296846 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1296847 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1296848 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1296849 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1296850 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1296851 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field

1296863 we need to rebuild our positions in cuba and other countries
1296864 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1296865 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1296866 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1296867 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1296868 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1296869 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually
1296870 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1296871 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1296872 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1296873 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1296874 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1296875 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1296876 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1296877 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1296878 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1296879 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1296880 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1296881 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1296882 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1296883 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1296884 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1296885 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1296886 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1296887 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1296888 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1296889 this is going to help so many people down the line
1296890 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1296891 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1296892 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1296893 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1296894 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm

1296910 this is just truly a real blessing we in return are distributing it to the folks who come through our doors everyone enjoys fresh grown local food there is just a big difference between something grown locally and something distributed from a country more than 2 000 miles away you can smell the sunshine in this food

1296927 there is a strong trend in the industry of restaurants providing more detailed information and choice in menu options for consumers
1296928 this is a positive trend and one that consumers have recognized a 2007 consumer survey showed that four out of five customers said there were more healthy options available and more food choices available than there were two years earlier
1296929 a lot of chain restaurants have added a couple of healthy options thats better than it was five years ago
1296930 but they need to offer a range of health options so parents and kids can find something that they can agree on

1296932 we dont think the consumer really understands that we use buyers just like department stores and that our selection isnt just a bunch of leftovers bought at the end of the season we want them to understand that our buyers are out there making decisions at the same time department stores and specialty stores are

1296940 durante los pr ximos meses vamos a ver como zapatero se queda s lo en su camino de b squeda de socios para los presupuestos generales del estado y con unos presupuestos prorrogados ser muy dif cil gobernar una espa a en crisis
1296941 si la separaci n entre psc y psoe contin a agrand ndose cosa que ocurrir en pr ximos d as con el debate sobre financiaci n auton mica es muy probable que el grupo socialista en el congreso se rompa y que el psoe deje de representar un proyecto nacional para defender cada uno sus intereses territoriales
1296942 si la fractura entre socialistas extreme os andaluces canarios y catalanes llegara a producirse el gobierno tendr a muy dif cil gobernar espa a correctamente en el medio plazo debido a la situaci n de desgobierno interno
1296943 esta divisi n interna del psoe y el debate sobre financiaci n auton mica puede hacer que zapatero no tenga socios internos ni externos para aprobar los presupuestos del 2009 ser a grav simo en la coyuntura econ mica en la que nos encontramos ir al 2009 con los presupuestos del 2008 prorrogados
1296944 las cifras del estado en 2008 eran para una coyuntura econ mica optimista y diferentes y resultar an inaplicables en una coyuntura de crisis con los presupuestos de 2008 prorrogados en 2009 la capacidad de zp para dirigir espa a en crisis estar a seriamente en entredicho y nos deber a explicar como va a abordar esta situaci n
1296945 vivimos una situaci n en la que los presupuestos dependen del apoyo de los partidos catalanes psc y ciu y del apoyo de los partidos catalanes depende de la financiaci n auton mica de catalu a le pedimos a zapatero que no cambie financiaci n de ventaja para una comunidad aut noma injusta e insolidariamente por respaldo a los presupuestos de la crisis
1296946 abandonar sus pactos si no cesan sus socios de insultar a los extreme os
1296947 es impresentable que los socialistas que gobiernan en extremadura sean los socios de gobierno de partidos en catalu a que insultan reiteradamente a extremadura el psoe o est con los extreme os o con quienes les humillan pero no puede estar pol ticamente en los dos sitios a la vez
1296948 la aportaci n de catalu a a la renta nacional a extremadura y a otras comunidades aut nomas no es solidaridad sino que es redistribuci n de riqueza puesto que en una espa a de ciudadanos libres e iguales la riqueza se reparte entre todos la solidaridad es otra cosa
1296949 kiwi discovery being a finalist is good recognition for the many hundreds of people who have worked with us over the years
1296950 we identified tourism as a being in a growth phase and queenstown was the place to build a business beyond the owner operator stage
1296951 we bought an existing business called value tours which was and still is a ski holiday operator and that became the start of a very long and successful relationship
1296952 tourism in queenstown then consisted of a number of smaller operators it was intensely competitive and many of them were struggling for survival if theres any difference between then and now operators are more co operative and less personally competitive today
1296953 the opportunity was first noticed by brian hutchins chief executive of fiordland travel which became real journeys he and i met and discussed the plight of rafting at the time and determined a way to consolidate it
1296954 were still enjoying good growth out of our existing product range so thats our current strategy but if any overwhelmingly attractive opportunities come along well take a look

1296957 i do recall that earlier in the year mr key was wandering around the treaty house grounds at waitangi looking for a friend and found one mr tame iti was the only one available at that time

1296965 no one knows where the balance of power lies at this moment
1296966 if there are two centers of power today it would be better for civil society even if the two camps are similar in aims
1296967 because it would provide a space for political influence and activism
1296968 there is 100 percent control of the political sphere nothing unexpected can happen without the kremlin pulling the puppet strings
1296969 putin has been the only decision maker with the authority of a monarch it will be years before medvedev develops his own power base that could provide a check on that power
1296970 this was democracy in the 1990s and it was bad for you putin has implied
1296971 when a problem flares up the government throws a few pennies at it its like emergency medical care
1296972 big business hates putin for what he did to mikhail khodorkovsky
1296973 the military hate him because he has ruined the army
1296974 they have traded political freedoms for a bit more bread and a calmer life
1296975 the public doesnt support civil society doesnt take human rights and the rule of law seriously
1296976 without public activism all we can hope for is mercy from the bosses they will throw us something and we will be grateful

1296980 aushev is a hero of the soviet union not by his words but by his deeds
1296981 the soviet union saw a tide of new weapons designs in the late 1980s which didnt reach a production stage
1296982 they can be described as new only in a sense that they werent built in numbers
1296983 i dont think that we are lagging behind in a critical way
1296984 the loss of technologies and the brain drain have led to a steady degradation of military industries

1296986 there is an acute shortage of key specialists turners welders millers
1296987 we built good planes in the past because we had a competition between aircraft makers
1296988 pulling all of them together under one roof will end competition and destroy what we had

1297014 he wasnt afraid to speak his mind he was an example for us all
1297015 we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1297016 it is ill advised to create a decision making process that requires parliament and the judiciary to ask and answer similar questions within a short space of time or at all
1297017 far from being a system of checks and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfill
1297018 half baked attempts to sugarcoat 42 day pre charge detention has left an embarrassing mess
1297019 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1297020 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1297021 it is an honour and a privilege to play for nelson mandela
1297022 i remember when i voted in 1994 and i wrote this song while standing in the queue
1297023 it is called winds of change and its one of the songs im going to play for madiba
1297024 jazz is an art form everybody has their own style and you learn a lot about your approach to culture in the way you listen to and play your music
1297025 its going to be similar to the remix i did with bongo maffin in 2000 i like to push the music and collaborating with these different artists adds a flavour to the music

1297030 we can see why there might be a rally in banking stocks in the short term but in the longer term we see more weakness ahead banks will need a lot more capital
1297031 i dont believe the emerging markets have completely decoupled there is no way a serious downturn in the us will leave asia immune
1297032 it is apparent that corporate activity in some sectors is slowing

1297035 we have already harmonised our export control requirements with that of nsg
1297036 all we want is a clean and unconditional exemption from the nsg
1297037 nsg guidelines require comprehensive safeguards applicable only to npt countries and since india has both civil and military programmes we have a unique position therefore such comprehensive safeguards are not relevant to india hence clean exemption from that is what we are seeking
1297038 they should exempt india from the requirement of comprehensive safeguards and add no other conditions
1297039 this is the worst communal flare up ive seen since 1947
1297040 the title of the film adds up to number 59 which is no doubt a symbol of tremendous power control status and success but given a choice an extra a in its title i e bachnaa ae haseenon would have made a world of difference
1297041 as the title and the cast suggests the film is primarily a romantic love story and by bringing the title to add up to number 60 the name then would have vibrated on number 6 of venus the planet of love peace joy happiness harmony etc
1297042 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel

1297046 i ummed and ah ed last year when i was asked whether i wanted the one day captaincy
1297047 but my gut instinct wasnt right now im more of a rounded figure as a player and ive got a lot more support from the lads thats one of the most exciting things all the text messages and phone calls from senior players in the squad who basically said were right behind you we support you give it your best shot once youve got the support of the lads around you theres nothing more you can ask for
1297048 and im sure he will take us forward in an exciting manner
1297049 i hope it wont restrict the way i play and i think it would be silly to start thinking that it will
1297050 i play the way that i play and its a way ive been successful so far in my career it is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and exactly the way you need to play against australia youve got to be positive and aggressive so hopefully it wont affect my batting
1297051 to understand that shot you need to know that i had just come down the wicket to murali three times i had hit him over mid off for four through mid off for four and then i had cut the doosra for four murali moved his mid off and mid on back and put men at deep square leg and cow corner all my options had been blocked
1297052 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him
1297053 i am trying to do something different in the film which is a romantic comedy
1297054 i signed harman because he suits the character in whats your raashee besides i liked harmans performance in love story 2050 he is a great dancer too
1297055 she is a good actor but i think she has a lot more to offer
1297056 i am trying to bring something special out of her in my next venture
1297057 this film is a challenge for me as it is very difficult to make a comedy but i like to face new challenges
1297058 i am a big fan of hrishi da and basu da i love to watch jyoti swaroop directed padosan again and again thats my favourite comedy film

1297082 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays
1297083 our nation comes from a history of deep division and strife let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road again lets work together and celebrate the promotion of unity within the organisation amongst our allies in the nation at large and amongst all our people
1297084 now as much as ever in our history we require disciplined leaders and members with respect for their organisation who care equally for all south africans and for all people who live within our borders
1297085 this forest is for wwf one of the most important places on earth it is at the cutting edge of conservation for this organisation
1297086 this is a place with stunning resources the only place where you can see lowland gorillas and forest elephants but more broadly a real spectacular forest from a biodiversity perspective
1297087 working at the highest levels with heads of states and foreign partners and at the same time working with local communities to try and find solutions which can sustain conservation in the long term so it is a flagship programme for our organisation
1297088 it is not something i see every day it is a wonderful landscape the gorillas are so special i have not seen gorillas for quite sometime so that was very special
1297089 i think there is a deep understanding within this organisation that conservation can only be successful if it works for people in particular who live in the areas we are trying to protect that we are broadly working for society we have recognised that for a very long time and the strategy that you now see developing in the congo basin for the amazon for the coral triangle and so on are focused on finding lasting solutions and lasting solutions means solutions that work for the people
1297090 the difference i see here is in the effort to integrate the local communities into the solution and also to enable sustainable economic activities to be carried out
1297091 that is the real future for a lot of protected areas
1297092 you cannot expect people to change their behaviours when they are not able to feed or send their children to school or have a better life i am very gratified to see how integrated the community leaders are in this project
1297093 is a ground breaking programme working with communities and working on the environment where the needs of the communities are so pre eminent
1297094 the meetings i had 18 months ago in yaounde obviously indicate to me that there is a real promise here you see some particular governments very serious about conservation and about really taking a leadership role in deciding how forest management can be done one of our tasks is to make sure that we are supporting those who want to do things the right way those who want to really find good solutions and to help make sure that they are successful we should not miss that opportunity here in cameroon
1297095 i think everyone recognises that this programme has been very successful in all aspects on developing skills within the communities on promoting cooperation amongst countries on protecting the environment and raising awareness i really think we are going to continue to support it
1297096 china development bank is willing to share its experience and provide financing to agricultural development in africa
1297097 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1297098 yes it is non negotiable that is our position and we are not moving from that position
1297099 the will of the people must be respected and this is why we are saying the transitional government must be led by tsvangirai for a period which is not going to exceed two years and create an environment where a free and fair election is going to be held

1297147 we are in a very problematic situation today especially the israeli embassy abroad because of the threats that we got from the terrorist organisation hezbollah to strike israeli embassies in west africa though they did not speak about a specific country but there is intelligence and information that speak about this possibility attack on israeli interests in nigeria
1297148 that shows progress and the three parties have a lot of work to do there must be accommodation and sincerity in the spirit enunciated by the principals at the signing of the memorandum of understanding
1297149 it is quite encouraging that zimbabweans are coming together under the auspices of a brotherly country and neighbour south africa the omen is very good

1297158 in general short holidays like weekend trips to a european city are becoming less popular probably due to a reduced spending power
1297159 fewer people make city trips which include a flight as these have become more expensive on the other hand city trips which are relatively cheaper than before like trips to london are making some headway

1297166 we are delighted to announce the addition of these new targeting capabilities together with the opportunities in our premium network this makes a very compelling argument for advertisers to continue to use otpmedia where campaign performance and acquisitions are key to success
1297167 wunderloops technology enables advertisers to serve users with ads that are both suitable and highly relevant creating an advertising environment which is hugely beneficial for both parties we look forward to working with otpmedia where we will be able to offer advertisers an extremely cost effective and highly targeted platform on which to reach their customers
1297168 we are always looking into new fresh innovative techniques to give us a better understanding of our customer and this is one of those methods the speed of data capture is important so that we can respond quickly to customer feedback we believe that edigitalresearchs research platform can deliver this
1297169 we have the speed in the race but if i cant get qualifying right we are going to end up at every race in the situation ive faced in the last two races
1297170 we need to sort it out and get back to the front so we can fight for the wins otherwise we are just following people and when you do that you cant use the speed
1297171 the car seems to be working well we just need to find a good set up again to fix a few problems and then we can be back in the hunt for wins
1297172 its been a bit difficult for me in the last few races but we are still in the championship
1297173 despite my problems finishing third yesterday and scoring more points than the guys in front of me in the championship was not too bad a result i will take it any way i can get it
1297174 we will see how we can sort things out for the next race and see if we can be stronger and fight for the victory
1297175 the global affiliate marketing landscape is undergoing enormous changes such as googles re launch of their affiliate network the industry is well placed to take full advantage of the current economic downturn leading more advertisers to take advantage of this risk free form of marketing

1297177 uk and european based digital companies launching offices in the us are on the increase for various reasons there is growing demand from advertisers to run campaigns internationally us brands need reliable and native speaking partners here and in europe and the size and language affinity of the us market make it very attractive to advertisers for example just recently eurostar amp british airways launched their affiliate programmes in the usa

1297239 when we first got here michael used to call from sudan and tell johannes that he would be in israel soon

1297551 mutis verdi is explosive taut and charged with raw energy its also loud brutal and disturbingly autocratic
1297552 riccardo muti is responsible for a lot of the problems he simply plays so loud that nobody has a chance
1297553 it was impossible not to notice riccardo muti s rather loud fanclub among the audience
1297554 what riccardo muti makes of verdi s most intelligent and advanced score borders on the scandalous the old trick as long as the music loud enough no one remembers
1297555 who for gods sake is responsible for the casting in salzburg and why on earth does riccardo muti accept this
1297556 no doubt that riccardo muti follows a long verdi tradition but that is the exact problem he only reproduces does not create anew

1297578 if there was any reason for presenting this opera in salzburg other than commerce none was apparent on saturday night shers production was utterly devoid of any dramaturgical substance and involved only the most overused of operatic gestures catherine zubers ostensibly renaissance costumes owed a bigger debt to pirates of the caribbean than to anything genuinely historical while michael yeargans sets were almost as stupidly vacuous

1297585 la manina con l orologio la sinistra la destra l altra per esclusione meno male non ne ho tre
1297586 magari mi scanso io ma se ci scansiamo nello stesso momento io sono quella dalla parte giusta sono quella che non deve muoversi
1297587 i knew that only nepo could outrun me in the last round but i thought that he would not win his game against bareev and therefore i accepted the draw offer
1297588 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1297589 i feel very proud to be able to contribute something to my country my nation and this is the way i know best
1297590 dont panic are now putting together our new wave pr event and we thought a meme might be a fun way to create some buzz identify potential speakers and find out who you feel the visionaries mavericks and pioneers of pr really are
1297591 the ideas simple were asking you to list the three communicators living or dead who have most influenced your way of thinking professionally and perhaps personally too who do you think the real innovators are whos been most responsible for kicking the industry forward and just who are the communication prunks
1297592 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1297593 n 2012 pia a de publicitate online va atinge 110 milioane de euro
1297594 this letter includes some really useful information for employers we are also updating our website so that all the relevant tools tables and guidance that employers use will be at their finger tips come september
1297595 your face is like seeing the face of god and you have accepted me
1297596 geen blijf te weten met de mosselexploitatie door gebrek aan ervaring van onze vissers en het dure prijskaartje van de exploitatie
1297597 due to unexpected blockade of the srinagar jammu highway the invitation cards issued to our valued guests may be treated as cancelled however simple marriage ceremony will take place on same dates august 6 7 and 8 kindly bear with us inconvenience is regretted
1297598 on the one hand the hindu extremists are stopping supplies to the valley while other are desperately trying to arrange mutton for wazwans
1297599 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1297600 we seek cooperation of the international community we are aware of japans sensitivity in view of that i reiterated our firm commitment to total disarmament and strict adherence to conditions of non proliferation as enshrined in various treaties
1297601 the jammu and kashmir government has succumbed to the pressure of the upa government at the centre on the issue and people of jammu and kashmir are being harassed and tortured by the police there
1297602 the pdp has sought disqualification of lodhi as mlc after he subverted the partys mandate and violated the anti defection law by joining another party
1297603 those who lost conviction have undermined value based politics and subvert law to their convenience there are precedents where members have chosen to resign and seek fresh mandate before changing parties but lodhi has followed the turncoats showing lack of character and integrity
1297604 i hope in time technology will sweep these things cap on fdi
1297605 i just do not believe in these accusations at all we do not want a situation where the indo pak dialogue would get affected
1297606 it would be formed after evidence is provided to us
1297607 if we get evidence we will certainly get to the bottom of this do not forget we have been victims of terrorism also it is in our own interest to get to the bottom of this
1297608 that of isi involvement has been sort of denied by pakistan and with good authority there is no truth in that there is no pakistani agency that is involved that is being referred to
1297609 we all have to live with one another awhile longer wouldnt it be good for everybody if the world came out of the olympics knowing and liking china a little more than before
1297610 what are we doing to prevent this illness from occurring here
1297611 weve had indications from virginia that they would welcome the museum
1297612 but weve not entered into any discussions to do so because we believe valley forge is the preferred location
1297613 how long were going to stick around remains to be seen
1297614 we may well lose the support of the board and abandon it
1297615 its not a little museum thats going to close at 5 or 8 at night its a huge commercial development
1297616 once they pave this its gone forever its going to break my heart is what its going to do because this land should belong to all americans
1297617 it would have been very easy to give this up
1297618 it depends on the cloud we have over us from npca
1297619 have their own parochial reasons why they are opposed to it
1297620 they dont want a successful museum next to a park thats deteriorated bureaucracy and the government is often petty
1297621 our concern is the impact of this museum development on the historic character of valley forge
1297622 if we build the museum its going to be good for the park and the park would be good for arc
1297623 if you are not prepared to take the action that needs to be taken if you cannot keep up and stay on top of things then you should leave this city government right now
1297624 the behavior exhibited by public employees is unacceptable i am furious at their actions
1297625 policies and procedures thats slightly abstract you had a real live person here who needed love and needed support and adults failed this person badly
1297626 this is serious work the fate of a child or a family could be in your hands
1297627 thats not to be taken lightly its not to be pushed over to the side its not to put papers in files some place and think the problem is going away
1297628 i had always felt that all things being equal probably the two biggest toughest hires were going to be police commissioner and dhs commissioner
1297629 it is so tragic it is so dehumanizing it is just astounding to me
1297630 ive just never read anything like that i hope to never read anything like that again
1297631 have not generated the increases in profit and cash flow anticipated
1297632 we do expect to succeed with the 39 stores and be a dominant player in the market that were known in in the years to come
1297633 its a question of getting the creditors to believe its better for them to hang in there and allow the workout to happen
1297634 you do not see a whole lot of examples of retailers shrinking attractively
1297635 it just doesnt happen that often doesnt mean it cant happen
1297636 its been an emotional roller coaster for each one of us in our own way
1297637 ive got to say that the familys been extremely supportive every one of them
1297638 i think its important to all of us that we recognize that we are family
1297639 and at the end of the day maybe thats the most important thing
1297640 it just seemed to me that whatever other personnel actions were going to be taken would have been taken at that time
1297641 the department of human services thats characterized in the grand jury report is from 2006
1297642 there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that this department will turn around
1297643 despite the exceptional nature of danieals situation not one supervisor gave her case extra attention or offered any guidance to laura sommerer
1297644 those responsible for checking on her safety seemed to think she must be fine as long as she was alive even if she was sitting alone in a stroller in a dark room all day wasting away
1297645 the actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
1297646 the grand jury has decided however to focus its criminal charges on those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
1297647 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands

1297666 were very comfortable with our position we could have raised substantially more money we turned people away
1297667 we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
1297668 our consistent focus has been to opportunistically reduce risk and in order to take advantage of this sizeable sale on an accelerated basis we have decided to further enhance our capital position
1297669 theres a realization that the stocks are not going to zero
1297670 an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1297671 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1297672 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1297673 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
1297674 our ability to attract a leader of sanjays caliber is a testament to the strong potential of the mobile devices business
1297675 we could possibly have negative growth in the third quarter household spending has been very weak
1297676 as the former riot police unit will be replaced by these new police unit we hope to sternly put law in order and to enforce peaceful rallies
1297677 the unit being set up now is not for defence purpose but to attack and arrest
1297678 this shows the basic principle of the police towards rallies it seems like they are treating the rally participants like terrorists or enemies this is a very dangerous situation
1297679 the local foreign affairs department made an apology tuesday to two japanese reporters
1297680 we strongly protest against the violent detention of a reporter who was reporting by fair means
1297681 we heard that the chinese side pointed out that it is forbidden to film military facilities and it seems like there was confusion because the scene of the assault was just 50 metres yards from a military facility
1297682 i could just see that the figure of the child it was lifeless
1297683 we try to protect our kids but we cant stand in front of them all the time
1297684 i dont know what we can do if these kids arent safe playing in front of their own houses
1297685 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1297686 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1297687 kami sengaja ingin membangun komunitas seni musik di restoran ini untuk menarik pelanggan semakin tertarik untuk datang
1297688 mereka yang datang ikut kelas kan bisa berjam jam tentu mereka butuh makan dan minum di situlah pendapatan diperoleh
1297689 menari adalah salah satu aktivitas olahraga jadi sebagian yang datang selain ingin makan mereka juga ingin olahraga yang tidak serius tapi menghibur
1297690 selain mendapat hiburan bisa menari dan menyanyi di sini saya bisa bertemu dengan banyak orang yang tentunya membuat saya semakin betah berlama lama di restoran ini
1297691 tetapi setidaknya tren ini tidak pernah benar benar mati tinggal cermat memilih momen dan melihat perkembangan tren gaya hidup orang membuat bisnis restoran dengan cara ini bisa tetap bertahan
1297692 indonesia adalah produsen kopi nomer empat di dunia sehingga kita bisa kembangkan industri kopi di indonesia
1297693 jadi kalau kita bisa dapat kopi tradisional yang harganya lebih murah kenapa musti harus bayar yang mahal untuk kopi merek asing
1297694 saya pencinta kopi dari sering ngopi saya bisa bedakan kopi mana yang enak dan yang tidak
1297695 misalnya saya ingin kopi yang ringan dan manis saya bisa pilih starbuck tetapi kalau saya ingin kopi yang serius dan berat saya pilih toraja coffee
1297696 menikmati kopi itu seperti juga menikmati wine di balik pahit dan hitamnya kopi ada citarasa yang sangat sulit digambarkan
1297697 dan trennya akan terus baik lebih dari 20 per tahun hingga 10 tahun mendatang
1297698 ini yang namanya ekonomi wisata bahari saat ada beberapa kawasan wisata bisa dikelola secara lebih baik maka akan mendatangkan nilai ekonomi yang tidak sedikit
1297699 luas terumbu karang di wakatobi mencapai 90 000 hektar dan di dalam lautnya ada 942 jenis ikan ada 750 jenis coral di seluruh dunia dari 850 di wakatobi karena laut merah hanya ada 300 jenis di lautan karibia juga cuma 50 jenis
1297700 jadi kalau ingin meningkatkan kunjungan wisman cruise harus menyediakan fasilitasnya dulu yang memadai
1297701 pengusaha manado yang ikut ikutan bisnis ini biasanya adalah pengusaha kopra yang tidak tahu bisnis wisata bahari karena money oriented maka usaha mereka tidak lama akan hancur

1297710 marco has reached the main base camp he is recovering the base camp has facilities to provide him with immediate medical help like oxygen and drugs so he will improve gradually
1297711 i dont think a rescue mission would be possible today
1297712 the weather is still bad flying in skardu and beyond was not possible this morning normally it takes two or three days to improve the weather in the area
1297713 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1297714 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down
1297715 they were far from me hours away but they were not turning around
1297716 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1297717 so far we have not received any report of casualties
1297718 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1297719 anybody who says we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1297720 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1297721 hasnt done much to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1297726 lang leve de lhasa ze zat negen maanden in de jeugdgevangenis van gutsa voordat ze werd vrijgelaten nochtans zou haar vrijheid niet lang duren in 1992 werd ze opnieuw gearresteerd voor het meedoen aan een andere demonstratie en ze werd meegenomen naar de beruchte drapchi gevangenis de straffen in drapchi waren wreed sangdrol werd gedwongen om slaag met ijzeren roeden en rubberen buizen te ondergaan evenals elektrische veeprikkers op haar tong te breien en spinnen totdat ze blaren op haar handen kreeg en zes maanden in totale duisternis terwijl ze in eenzame opsluiting zat er was ook zeer onplezierige dwangarbeid secreetmest voor de tuin gebruiken dan moet je omstebeurt naar de latrine en de drek aangeven als er aan de emmer wordt getrokken is het onvermijdelijk dat het overal rondspat en gemorst wordt en gaat het zelfs je mond in
1297727 we moesten zijne heiligheid de dalai lama hekelen en we mochten niet onze religie uitoefenen
1297728 zelfs toen ik voor het eerst naar de gevangenis ging wist ik dat dit soort martelingen plaatsvonden maar ik was zelfs bozer dat een indringer naar ons land zou komen en onze mensen zou vervolgen

1297731 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1297732 jackie is a sag member so if sag goes on strike he cant do anything
1297733 if there isnt a strike there should be an announcement any time
1297734 i have never said that i will not work with salman khan after
1297735 if dates permit i will surely be part of the show
1297736 it is an entertaining film and we have worked very hard on it
1297737 the combined market share for compact cars compact trucks and compact suvs is near its all time high
1297738 we expect these three segments to make up around 35 of the total market in july compared to just 23 in july of 2003
1297739 if you dont want to cut service its going to have to be hefty
1297740 the next fare increase i dont know what that number would have to be but it would have to be pretty substantial
1297741 the riders cant take another fare increase especially low income communities
1297742 i dont think the ts problems are a great secret here
1297743 its going to require a lot of things fares may be part of a solution to a larger problem or set of problems there are limits to what you can do with fares
1297744 i gotta say that as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit particularly because weve been losing lately
1297745 but it is a very attractive shirt i must say
1297746 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1297747 given the perception out there i hope that figure would be a surprise to people
1297748 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people
1297749 what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1297750 when she speaks about unifying the party i totally believe she means it and i know she is doing everything she can do to make sure that happens
1297751 one of the finest public servants we have in this country
1297752 were now in the process of bringing the party together so we come out of that convention entirely unified and ready to take on the last leg of this journey
1297753 if you are like me you are hungry for a change in direction
1297754 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1297755 everybody i think was taken aback because we had won iowa and there was this giddy sense that this thing is rolling this thing is moving and then we lost
1297756 i recite all this history because we do have three more months of work in this campaign and i think that theres a tendency particularly for democrats to start feeling kind of giddy again after a primary in the summer months
1297757 a fingerprint connected him to a license application and an alias on the application connected him to a murder in california

1297759 he would just say to everybody my name is clark rockefeller
1297760 everywhere clark went if the rockefeller name came up it was more of a burden than a blessing
1297761 we did a survey of chief executives and found that people are looking for information on the best way to design a building to be sustainable and green and there really isnt anything out there serving that need
1297762 also we have had the good design is good business awards going on for ten years here which is also a joint effort between architectural record and businessweek so this is a brainchild out of that
1297763 this generation is not satisfied with hearing a single perspective so we thought that the best way to tell the story of the marines was to share multiple perspectives
1297764 we thought the experiences of other marines would be the best way to tell what it is like to be a marine
1297765 so we developed a way for them to share their stories on our social networking site and to spread these stories virally across bigger social sites
1297766 this is a campaign to get peo ple to connect with our marines com and spread it outwards
1297767 people can take the stories to their own sites and to their pages on face book and myspace
1297768 many people will join the group and ask for advice on the social net working forum and others from the community will respond with their experiences
1297769 people would rather hear from other marines and their families than us speaking to them from the official side its great for mothers of marines to go on and meet other mothers
1297770 we have always been very up front about the fact that we are a war fighting organi zation

1297783 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus beberapa rasul sebelum kamu dan kami memberikan kepada mereka isteri isteri dan keturunan
1297784 kemudian kami utus kepada umat umat itu rasul rasul kami berturut turut tiap tiap seorang rasul datang kepada umatnya umat itu mendustakannya maka kami perikutkan sebagian mereka dengan sebagian yang lain dan kami jadikan mereka buah tutur manusia maka kebinasaanlah bagi orang orang yang tidak beriman
1297785 kemudian mereka pengikut pengikut rasul itu menjadikan agama mereka terpecah belah menjadi beberapa pecahan tiap tiap golongan merasa bangga dengan apa yang ada pada sisi mereka masing masing
1297786 maka masing masing mereka mendurhakai rasul tuhan mereka lalu allah menyiksa mereka dengan siksaan yang sangat keras
1297787 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mendatangkan al kitab taurat kepada musa dan kami telah menyusulinya berturut turut sesudah itu dengan rasul rasul dan telah kami berikan bukti bukti kebenaran mukjizat kepada isa putera maryam dan kami memperkuatnya dengan ruhul qudus
1297788 apakah kamu mengakui dan menerima perjanjian ku terhadap yang demikian itu

1297810 can any of you think of a reason why you wouldnt be capable of answering the question of which parent this little six year old boy should live with in a fair and impartial manner
1297811 yeah see my thing here is that my perception of these sorts of these things is that the guy in these cases always gets the shaft seems like everybody automatically assumes the kid would be better off living with the mom even if the mom is unmarried and has a lousy job while the father is married and makes a decent salary ive heard about that before id definitely stick to my guns on that decision
1297812 can any of you think of a reason why you wouldnt be able to be overall impartial in this case
1297813 with all due respect to you and the lady who is prosecuting this case sir i dont like lawyers
1297814 well ive known a bunch of lawyers in life and theyre just not my cup of tea
1297815 what but it says on your form that youre the office manager for a telecom company
1297816 and i wrote the truth sir however its a very small company and i work directly with the president of the company and hes barred in the state of connecticut he is shall we say an acquired taste
1297817 so lets get this straight you dont like him because hes a lawyer or you dont like him because hes a yankee
1297818 you do realize dont you that youre definitely going to be called for this jury now right
1297819 yeah you called way too much attention to yourself in there
1297820 okay you may be wondering why we called you in here privately while all the other jurors are taking their break
1297821 well i thought you might be mad at me for what i said earlier about lawyers
1297822 actually i was hoping youd repeat it everyone else thought it was hysterical but im a little hard of hearing and couldnt understand what you said
1297823 i see well sir it really wasnt meant to be a joke i guess its a little funny but its the truth i really feel that way i dont like lawyers
1297824 i see did you have a negative experience with one
1297825 oh yes i see that here very well it also says here that you dont think youd be able to render a completely fair verdict in regards to custody of the little boy
1297826 then wouldnt serving on this jury be a good opportunity for you to do something about all that
1297827 oh indeed it would your honor but thats the entire problem ive made tons of judgments about this case already
1297828 okay well you asked the father is married to this other girl right his wife is here with him right now shes sitting right over there she obviously cares enough about him to be here even though this isnt her son were talking about here and the father himself is here too he filed this lawsuit so he obviously loves his son and wants whats best for him and he looks like a pretty nice guy the mom and no offense to you miss this is just my observation now shes here all alone for all i know shes not married so right away ive got a bias here that says the child would be better off with a family that always support and take care of each other if the plaintiffs wife is here when she doesnt even have to be my gut reaction is to say that shed probably do a great job taking care of the boy
1297829 haha then it sounds like this will be a slam dunk for you
1297830 it just might be your honor but im flat out telling you im biased in this if thats the kind of juror you all want hey sign me up but im telling you now im not likely to change my mind even if and probably especially because i have to listen to some lawyer running his mouth for hours on end
1297831 hahahaha okay well thanks a lot we appreciate your time and your honesty you may rejoin the others out in the hall

1297837 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served and as president well ensure that economic justice is served thats what this election is about
1297838 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
1297839 if we invest in our families and in ordinary americans by helping them go to college with tax cuts for 95 percent of families to reward them for hard work and give tax cuts to help them save for retirement such are the ways everyone can have a stake in our economy
1297840 they resulted in a chain reaction of economic growth more jobs higher corporate profits and more tax receipts
1297841 we americans cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to be ok thats not leadership thats not going to happen
1297842 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies

1297851 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1297852 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1297853 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1297859 gore was one of the first politicians to grasp the seriousness of climate change and to call for a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases he held the first congressional hearings on the subject in the late 1970s
1297860 humankind has suddenly entered into a brand new relationship with the planet earth the worlds forests are being destroyed an enormous hole is opening in the ozone layer living species are dying at an unprecedented rate
1297861 made extensive use of the internet to increase student awareness of their environment
1297862 would result in serious harm to the economy of the united states
1297863 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
1297864 my strong message to the party is that there are a number of options
1297865 they need to find one that involves me they came and asked me to run because of my background and i still intend to run
1297866 ive known diedre willmott for a long time i hold her in the highest regard obviously diedre would make a very fine member of parliament
1297867 anyone that thinks that we will get elected because of the dysfunction in the liberal party is wrong
1297868 employers should be careful that they are going to get sued
1297869 they are treating employees unfairly in the first place and wasting human resources in the context that they are relying on these weight based stereotypes
1297870 the selectors are discussing changes in the pace department and whether to continue with michael vandort
1297871 thats something for us to discuss we felt that in these kind of conditions usually the medium pacers are effective as well ishant is an exceptional bowler with his height and everything he creates a bit of bounce on this kind of wicket we just need to make a smart choice
1297872 we will have a chat with the selectors we have a few options in our squad we will see what we can come up with
1297873 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1297874 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1297875 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1297876 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1297877 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1297878 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1297879 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle

1297884 masalah sebenarnya adalah globalisasi yang benar versus globalisasi yang salah jika kita berdiam diri membiarkan globalisasi mengalir tak terkendali itulah globalisasi yang amat salah besar globalisasi semacam ini hanya didominasi perusahaan perusahaan dan negara negara berkekuatan besar mereka tidak akan memerhatikan kepentingan perusahaan atau negara negara kecil
1297885 kalau sebagai umat beragama kita tidak aktif menentang struktur struktur sosial dan organisasi organisasi ekonomi yang menyebabkan orang menjadi miskin dan lapar agama akan terdegradasi menjadi momok yang masih punya arti bagi para penakut jika agama dan umat beragama tidak mengungkapkan cinta kasih allah dan tidak menjadi pionir dalam proses konstruktif terhadap keadaan manusia dewasa ini agama justru akan disamakan dengan ketidakadilan dan penindasan

1297897 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1297898 i think anybody would find it difficult to maintain a very high level of popularity when average people are having the problems they are having today in the uk and the us with the soaring price of gasoline and the cost of living going up
1297899 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1297900 the prime minister when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do but i am very clear in my mind that provided we can get across to people what were for the difference that the government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn this situation around
1297901 im optimistic we can turn things round and we can win
1297902 its clear from research that weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
1297903 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1297904 the government is clearly pussy footing around this issue unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1297905 falling commodity prices are certainly adding weight to the dollars recent gains but a degree of caution should probably be exercised before becoming too convinced that this is an established trend not least as the scope for rate cuts from the fed in the second half of the year remains a real possibility
1297906 however oil prices may now be moving into an established downward trend as inventories build demand particularly in the u s is tailing off and perhaps most significantly some are realizing that the speculative run higher for crude could be at an end
1297907 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1297908 what lord how lord how can i use this for your glory what do you wish i would see through this and how may your name be magnified
1297909 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1297910 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result

1297922 lake of the torches resort casino has continued its winning ways in the romero awards the most prestigious awards in the gaming industry by collecting a diamond gold two silvers and five honorable mentions in the 2008 competition
1297923 while i am not sure how lake of the torches continues to crank out such award winning marketing it is clear that they continue to get it and that excellent casino marketing focuses on its customers its employees and its communities kudos to lake of the torches and i would expect its competitors to be beating down its doors or sneaking around its rugs to see how it does it

1297925 our guests can be assured that lake of the torches will remain at the forefront of the gaming industry and can expect latest and best in casino promotions in the months and years to come
1297926 that is just enough time for online retailers to evaluate their sites and implement the necessary changes in a weakened economy more than ever it is important that retailers make the most of all sales opportunities it may require a small investment in terms of improving or acquiring new revenue generating tools but the increased profits certainly make it worth while

1297930 green means a healthy home healthy for guests and the planet it is not as simple as putting out a recycling bin and asking guests to conserve water going for the green takes more than fluorescent light bulbs

1297951 i attend to identify trends in new markets and to assess new market opportunities and i believe that this could be a key focus for many businesses given the changing market environment
1297952 this year in hyderabad we will have an added benefit in meeting quality indian wholesalers as well i consider the mart a must attend for all our colleagues in the sri lankan travel industry

1297960 our experience of other regeneration schemes throughout the uk has taught us that providing an element of housing will ensure this becomes a sustainable scheme over the long term as well as adding to the security and character of the development and surrounding area
1297961 this scheme will bring inward investment to the area and will create 60 jobs
1297962 the apartments will also be affordable which will allow first time buyers the opportunity to get on the property ladder something which previously seemed unimaginable
1297963 confirming agreement on a number of areas relating to policing and justice
1297964 they really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1297965 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they cant expect that when they havent spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1297966 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1297967 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1297968 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they cant deal with on top of all the others theyve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1297969 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1297970 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has

1297974 the department regrets that this service will no longer be available to the majority of patients who have used it over the last few years
1297975 the original service provided excellent benefits to patients as well as to pharmacists and gps and the enhanced service would have brought further benefits to all concerned
1297976 the opportunity for pharmacy contractors to provide the enhanced service is still available and the department welcomes that some contractors have decided to provide the new enhanced service to patients
1297977 we know that patients value this service and will benefit greatly from the improved access to a range of additional therapy areas
1297978 those contractors who currently are not providing the enhanced service are encouraged to give the matter further consideration and elect to provide a service supported by substantial new funding which expands the professional role of the pharmacist and improves patients access to advice and treatment for a range of minor ailments
1297979 nbta and the business travel community congratulate senators klobuchar thune leahy mccaskill and voinovich for introducing the fast redress act in the senate
1297980 these leaders recognize that an efficient and effective redress system for travelers who are unnecessarily flagged for secondary screening will make travel more convenient and productive for those individuals cleaning up misidentifications also will allow the transportation security administration to more effectively use limited airport screening resources
1297981 its so exciting to know that we are helping to advance legislation that will be valuable for thousands of business travelers and their companies when i met with senator mccaskills office the staff took time to understand the issues surrounding redress and how those challenges impact american businesses now i see that discussion had a real impact

1298022 whether you have been unsuccessful but still wish to secure a place at university if you have excelled and want to reconsider your options or even have had a change of heart and want to apply to university in the first instance clearing can help students in all of these scenarios
1298023 we have a team of experts at the university ready and waiting to take calls and emails and provide vital information and guidance
1298024 for me the clearing process gave me crucial information advice and ultimately the confidence boost i needed to help me fulfil my ambitions of higher education
1298025 i had always found the whole exam process difficult i would put in the long hours of revision but nerves would take over on the day which resulted in disappointing grades
1298026 clearing gave me a new lease of life allowing me to review my options get into a course of my choice and follow my dreams within two days of contacting the team at the university of aberdeen i had received an unconditional offer to begin a bsc in neuroscience with psychology i changed courses at the end of my first year to study biomedical sciences and i now plan to apply for medicine i could never have imagined that i would be on the way to fulfilling my ambition of becoming a surgeon when i opened my exam results that day but clearing really gave me the second chance i needed
1298027 it is important that students considering entering clearing approach the process as the start of a new beginning rather than a last ditch option clearing presents a vital opportunity to get a second bite at the cherry in fulfilling your dreams of a higher education and for most the outcome is extremely positive the crucial message is be brave and pick up the phone and discover what options are out there for you

1298118 the end of the season was great when i get in a rhythm and start playing regularly it makes a big difference i started scoring a few goals and that will continue as long as i cam on the pitch and im fine
1298119 we had a good time of it and there was a feel good factor about the club and we were buzzing as a group hopefully we can start the new season the same way as we finished the last one
1298120 kevin keegan is bubbly he knows the club inside out he knows what he wants and what the team needs
1298121 everyone has admiration for him he can give us success and first of all that has to be to do better than last year
1298122 but i look at it and say success would be to be in the mix for a european place last season was embarrassing for us it wasnt nice at all yes it was a failure we didnt perform well and finished down in the wrong half of the table
1298123 this year we have to improve and be challenging for trophies which is where we should be no one could be proud of what we did last season finishing down there hurts me and the rest of the lads the only consolation was that we eventually put a good run together and made sure our premier league place was safe
1298124 the manager is obviously very upbeat around the place he wants the fittest camp he has ever had and that has been the emphasis the fitter we are the better we will be so it has to be harder
1298125 there are only five teams in the championship that have not played in the premier league and we are one of them
1298126 and there are six clubs that are still getting parachute payments after coming down thats what we are competing against in this division we are trying to build to get out of it and the players have got to produce what they did near the end of last season
1298127 but weve got a good squad of players and weve added new players some youth and some experience we are trying to add another two or three
1298128 it will be a sad day when we move across the road but it will be a fantastic achievement for the football club with everything thats gone on its no mean feat by this football club to actually deliver what i dont think a lot of fans thought was every going to happen
1298129 with or without religion good people can behave well and bad people can do evil but for good people to do evil that takes religion
1298130 various processes in the universe can be displayed as a succession of states in such a way that the preceding state is a cause of the succeeding one and there is always a dynamical law prescribing how one state should generate another state but dynamical laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations and if we ask about the cause of the universe we should ask about a cause of mathematical laws by doing so we are back in the great blueprint of gods thinking the universe the question on ultimate causality why is there something rather than nothing when asking this question we are not asking about a cause like all other causes we are asking about the root of all possible causes
1298131 there is always something presumptuous almost distasteful about attempts to discuss the problem of evil in an academic context from the armchair or the study desk none of the above arguments are meant to constitute anything like a solution of the problem in the sense that they would enable someone to get it neatly crossed off on the checklist of possible obstacles to theistic belief for the question has to do with real human suffering something that we can only begin to understand properly through personal experience and something whose qualities and dimensions it is fearfully hard to grasp fully from the outside in areas where our own experience falls short what is more religious allegiance for the believer can never be a matter of having sailed into the calm lagoon of faith all problems and doubts left behind it is something far more dynamic even dangerous charged with the kind of recurring anguish that is conveyed by the poet hopkins as he recalls that night that year of now done darkness i wretch lay wrestling with my god my god the horrors of the human condition of what we do to each other and what we suffer as denizens of the natural world are beyond our human power ever fully to encompass with the intellect alone is this not one possible conclusion to be derived from the book of job the world is a terrible place even if it is also a place of great joy and beauty but even in a world where the overwhelming majority led lives of comparative joyousness the ultimate distress of one soul would be enough to make things fundamentally awry what the theist has to hold onto is the idea of vulnerability as inherent in this very idea of a physical universe of the kind we inhabit even a divinely created one and what faith has to build on to this though this will take us beyond the reach of philosophy alone is the idea that this very vulnerability may be the instrument of hope and redemption

1298138 i n most western societies there is now a class in which tedium vitae is very common almost normal this is the class from which the great majority of heroin addicts now comes the young of this class are disaffected and have good reason to be so they are for the most part poor though not of course in the absolute sense on the contrary they are healthier better fed dressed and sheltered than the great majority of the worlds population past and present and dispose of appurtenances whose sophistication would have astonished our forefathers but they are poor in the context of their own societies which is what counts psychologically such relative poverty counts in other ways too as amartya sen has recently argued and they are so badly educated this time in the absolute sense that any historical or geographical comparison by means of which they might put their poverty in some kind of perspective is completely beyond them they have no interests intellectual or cultural the consolations of religion are closed to them as for their family lives loosely so called it is usually of an utterly chaotic nature their sexual relationships are a kaleidoscope of ephemeral couplings often with abandoned offspring as a result motivated by an immediate need for sexual release and often complicated by primitive egotistical possessiveness leading to violence and conflict their emotional life is intense but shallow and their interactions with others governed by power rather than any kind of principle life is a matter of doing what you can get away with their economic prospects are poor they are unskilled in countries in which the demand for unskilled labour is limited any work that they do will be repetitive and dull and while a man might once have derived satisfaction from performing a menial task well from leading a life of modest usefulness to others this is not an age when such humility is very common in large part this is because people live to a quite unprecedented degree in the virtual world of so called popular culture from the very earliest age their lives are saturated with images of celebrities whose attainments are often modest but who have been whisked by good fortune into a world of immense and glamorous luxury this comparison with their own surroundings squalid if not poor in the literal sense is not only stark but painful and is experienced as an open wound into which salt is continually rubbed it is also experienced as an injustice for why should people with tastes and accomplishments not so very different from their own lead a life of fairy tale abundance the injustice of which they feel themselves to be the victim reduces any lingering inhibitions against causing harm to society which means in practice individual members of society crime ceases to be crime but is rather restitution or justified revenge and the fact that the abundance they so desire is itself empty and leads to dissatisfaction and boredom entirely escapes them the end result is that while profoundly dissatisfied with their present lot they do not have ambitions towards which they might actually work in a constructive fashion but daydreams in which every thing is solved at once in a magical way daydreams from which the emergence into reality is always painful any aid to the perpetuation of the state of daydreaming or reverie as coleridge and de quincy call it is therefore greatly appreciated
1298139 today most observers judge utopias or their sympathizers as foolhardy dreamers at best and murderous totalitarians at worst
1298140 the concept of moral persons being free and equal is now located in the public culture of our democratic society
1298141 rawls can evade the metaphysical question regarding the truth of moral principles only by taking the antimetaphysical and antirealistic position that is the concept of moral persons is not a metaphysical entity but only a product of our culture or rather the kantian ideals of liberty and equality have no significance outside our tradition of liberal democracy in that case the original position and the two principles of justice can make normative claims only for those who happen to share the same kantian ideals there is no reason to say that the conception of justice as fairness is objectively better than any other conception so rawls wants to regard moral facts and moral ideals as social and cultural entities this amounts to a surrender to normative positivism moral norms and ideals are no more than social or cultural facts normative positivism inevitably leasd to moral and cultural relativism kant took the transcendental perspective chiefly to avoid the evils of normative positivism and moral relativism in that regard rawlss kantian conventionalism goes against the spirit of kants own philosophy
1298142 kants vindication of practical reason is decisively different from the conceptions of reasonableness that rawls has put forward in the later versions of his theory of justice rawls depicts a conception of democratic citizenship within a bounded society as the source and context of reasoning about justice by contrast kant although he uses such terms as citizenship and public metaphorically deploys a conception of practical reason which does not presuppose that those who reason about justice and politics must be linked by common citizenship in a bounded society with a democratic constitution kant consequently views state boundaries and the system of states the exclusions and inclusions which define citizenship in those states as well as the nature of a just constitution as problems for justice rather than as presuppositions of justice as he sees it basic political institutions do not confer but rather need justification to invoke them in its absence is to appeal to spurious authorities in rejecting not only justifications that appeal to shared norms but those that appeal to shared citizenship kant embarks on a construction of justice whose broadest vision is of a cosmopolitan order within which states are to be justified by contrast rawls who views bounded societies as in part constitutive of reason must treat international justice as an appendix to domestic justice the formula of universal law proposes as the test of ethical adequacy simply that agents adopt principles which they take it could be adopted by willed by all others it is as kant puts it a conception of the reasonable which addresses the public in the strict sense that is the world rather than the restricted public of a particular society or state kants public is not the rawlsian public consisting only of fellow citizens in a bounded liberal democratic society it is unrestricted hence kants conception of ethical method takes a cosmopolitan rather than an implicitly statist view of the scope of ethical concern correspondingly he takes a more demanding view of the construction of principles in that he conceives of justification as aiming to reach all others without restriction
1298143 two currents of utopian thought the blueprint tradition and the iconoclastic tradition
1298144 tossed around as a term of abuse as it suggests that someone is not simply unrealistic but prone to violence
1298145 the blueprint utopians have attracted the lions share of attention both scholarly and popular
1298146 t he iconoclastic utopians offer little concrete to grab onto they provide neither tales nor pictures of the morrow next to the blueprinters they appear almost as ineffable as they actually are they vanish into the margins of utopianism blochs spirit of utopia opens mysteriously i am we are that is enough now we have to begin in regard to the future the iconoclasts were ascetic but they were not ascetics this point must be underlined inasmuch as iconoclasm sometimes suggests a severe and puritanical temper if anything it is a longing for luxe and sensuousness that define the iconoclastic utopian not a cold purity in an image obsessed society such as our own i suggest that the traditional blueprint utopianism may be exhausted and the iconoclastic utopianism indispensable the iconoclastic utopians resist the modern seduction of images pictures and graphics are not new of course but their ubiquity is a curtain of images surrounds us from morning till night and from childhood to old age the word both written and oral seems to retreat in the wake of these images
1298147 it is not enough to say that nazi ideology was a caricature of nietzsche since the essence of a caricature is that it helps us to recognize the original the nazis told their supermen to read the will to power and it is no good saying that this was a mere chance and that they might equally well have chosen the critique of practical reason it is not a matter of establishing the guilt of nietzsche who as an individual was not responsible for the use made of his writings nevertheless the fact that they were so used is bound to cause alarm and cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to the understanding of what was in his mind st paul was not personally responsible for the inquisition and for the roman church at the end of the fifteenth century but the inquirer whether christian or not cannot be content to observe that christianity was depraved or distorted by the conduct of unworthy popes and bishops he must rather seek to discover what it was in the pauline epistles that gave rise in the fullness of time to unworthy and criminal actions
1298148 certainly it would be entirely unjustified to insist on conformity with lexicographical usage however i think such a strange deviation from usage should have firmer grounds than a construction built from disparate elements of theories
1298149 poppers reasonable argument has echoed down the intellectual corridors of history each decade it gains more recruits in the immediate future it would be supplemented by end of ideology thinkers such as raymond aron in europe and daniel bell in the united states other refugee thinkers would confirm and collaborate poppers positions they would expand the category of utopians to include all those with a plan and they would charge utopians with violence implicitly or explicitly utopians meant marxists that much perhaps most of twentieth century mass violence had little to do with utopians barely intruded upon the argument
1298150 utopia is an attack on both the doctrine of original sin which imposes rigid limits on mens social potentialities and on all actual societies which always fall so short of mens real capacities the object of these models however was never to set up a perfect community but simply to bring moral judgement to bear on the social misery to which men have so unnecessarily reduced themselves for the fault is not in god fate or nature but in ourselves where it will remain to recognize this to accept it to contemplate and to judge that was the function of the classical utopia
1298151 h istorically that makes no sense we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
1298152 a campaign in which voters have voiced concerns about the safety of the first african american front runner in history
1298153 clinton has already faced harsh criticism for allegedly exacerbating racial divisions
1298154 much better would be for you to work up your email into a letter to which lyn julius could be invited to respond in the next issue of democratiya i think a free exchange of arguments is better than talk of retractions and so on what do you think
1298155 thats fine although one would think there would be no case whatsoever for an argument based on the passage i cited and i of course will now tediously cite yet more passages sometimes the evidence is such preponderant overwhelming obvious clear what have you that it is determinative or decisive as in this case when you have a patent contradiction between the assertion by julius and a sentence from the book a sentence that is not vague ambiguous less than forthright etc and is backed by similar passages that both precede and follow it in the book in short she has nothing whatsoever to construct an argument on with which to support her proposition there are no premises from which she may build a supporting argument but by all means lets proceed into the realm of magical realism of political fantasy of wishful thinking of states of denial
1298156 john walt and stephen mearsheimers the israel lobby and us foreign policy persuasive
1298157 in contrast to walt and mearsheimers account of a shadowy jewish cabal manipulating us foreign policy wisses book is a study of jewish powerlessness
1298158 the israel lobby is the antithesis of a cabal or conspiracy it operates out in the open and proudly advertises its own clout in its basic operations the israel lobby is no different from interest groups like the farm lobby steel and textile workers
1298159 the claim that an interest group whose ranks are mostly jewish has a powerful not to mention negative influence on u s foreign policy is sure to make some americans deeply uncomfortable and possibly fearful and angry because it sounds like a charge lifted from the notorious protocols of the elders of zion that well known anti semitic forgery that purported to reveal an all powerful jewish cabal exercising secret control over the world
1298160 given this long history of persecution american jews are understandably sensitive to any argument that sounds like someone is blaming them for policies gone awry this sensitivity is compounded by the memory of bizarre conspiracies theories of the sort laid out in the protocols dire warnings of secretive jewish influence remain a staple of neo nazis and other extremists such as the hate mongering former ku klux klan leader david duke which reinforces jewish concerns even more
1298161 the israel lobby is not a cabal or conspiracy or anything of the sort it is engaged in good old fashioned interest group politics which is as american as apple pie pro israel groups in the united states are engaged in the same enterprise as other interest groups like the national rifle association nra and the aarp or professional associations like the american petroleum institute all of which also work hard to influence congressional legislation and presidential priorities and which for the most part operate in the open
1298162 j j goldberg editor of the jewish weekly newspaper the forward and the author of jewish power inside the american jewish establishment nicely captures the difficulty of talking about the lobby it seems as though were forced to choose between jews holding vast and pernicious control or jewish influence being non existent in fact he notes somewhere in the middle is a reality that none wants to discuss which is that there is an entity called the jewish community made up of a group of organizations and public figures thats part of the political rough and tumble theres nothing wrong with playing the game like everybody else we agree completely but we think it is fair and indeed necessary to examine the consequences that this rough and tumble interest group politics can have on america and the world
1298163 we use israel lobby as a convenient shorthand term for the loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively work to shape u s foreign policy in a pro israel direction the lobby is not a single unified movement with a central leadership however and the individuals and groups that make up this broad coalition sometimes disagree on specific policy issues nor is it some cabal or conspiracy on the contrary the organizations and individuals who make up this lobby operate out in the open and in the same way that other interests groups do using the term israel lobby is itself somewhat misleading insofar as many of the individuals and some of the groups in this loose coalition do not engage in formal lobbying activities direct efforts to persuade elected officials rather the various parts of the lobby work to influence u s policy in a variety of ways much as other interest groups do one might more accurately dub this the pro israel community or even the help israel movement because the range of activities that different groups undertake goes beyond simple lobbying nonetheless because many of the key groups do lobby and because the term israel lobby is used in common parlance along with labels such as the farm lobby insurance lobby gun lobby or other ethnic lobbies we have chosen to employ it here
1298164 if michael doesnt like something hell explain to me why he doesnt like it hell say i just think the melody could be better or i think that a stronger lyric could go here
1298165 emotion pervades the law in the conventional story emotion has a certain narrowly defined place in law it is assigned to the criminal courts it is confined to those like witnesses the accused the public without legal training in this story there is a finite list of law related emotions anger compassion mercy vengeance hatred and each emotion has a proper role and a fixed definition and it is crucially important to narrowly delineate that finite list and those proper roles so that emotion doesnt encroach on the true preserve of law which is reason but the law in general is imbued with emotion not just the obvious emotions like mercy and the desire for vengeance but disgust romantic love bitterness uneasiness fear resentment cowardice vindictiveness forgiveness contempt remorse sympathy hatred spite malice shame respect moral fervor and the passion for justice emotion pervades not just the criminal courts with their heat of passion and insanity defenses and their angry or compassionate jurors but the civil courtrooms the appellate courtrooms the legislatures it propels judges and lawyers as well as jurors litigants and the lay public indeed the emotions that pervade law are often so ancient and deeply ingrained that they are largely invisible
1298166 w e do not have any way to establish the truth of a belief or the rightness of an action except by reference to the justification we offer for thinking what we think or doing what we do the philosophical distinction between justification and truth seems not to have any practical consequences
1298167 to affirm that there can be several different systems all giving us at the same time varying and yet legitimate true metaphysical descriptions of the world does not necessarily entail that there are many realities that nothing is absolutely real or put less dramatically that there is no such thing as a single context neutral description or account of the world that is as the world really is it only means that no metaphysical description of it can be outside every possible conceptual framework but reality itself is nor does it follow that any assertions about this real or true world beyond all conceptual frameworks are nonsense we need not accept a very different solution such as that offered by kant that there is a world in which there exists the thing in itself but that we can never directly know this world the conceptual frameworks we build in the realm of rational thought are not useless just because they cannot describe ultimate reality serious examination of reflection on these explanatory and interpretive schemes their differences and overlaps are crucial to expanding and deepening our understanding of reality even if these conceptual frameworks any or all possible combinations and collections of them cannot bring us the absolute truth if nothing else they enable us to understand the relativity of conceptual truths and structures and make us see what pascal meant when he said that the highest function of reason is to show us the limitations of reason
1298168 indian classical philosophy since it is always connected with religion must and does believe with complete assurance in the possibility of human beings actually attaining to a perfect knowledge of reality a scientia intuitiva that leads to the divine or the absolute truth
1298169 current experience is not of the sole and determinate reality 2 but the standards for the validation of current experience are legitimate
1298170 the current decision by mpshe was a decision that was taken on a clean slate

1298173 that shows progress the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda the omen is very good
1298174 if a breakthrough is near it might not necessarily be because more people are now involved if anything i think the more the people the more difficult it might be to reach an agreement
1298175 but nothing is obvious in politics remember the original six negotiators have been at it for over a year now and have grown familiar which could cloud their views on certain issues and impinge on their efficiency
1298176 its not a 2010 story alone south africa has been under spending we are running out of production capacity so it will be unrealistic to expect the economy to grow at 4 to 5 if we dont boost our capacity
1298177 a key driver of future construction industry activity will be governments planned spend of around r600 billion in infrastructural investment over the medium term
1298178 we are already seeing foreign contractors in some local projects

1298189 the federal constitution has three forms of protection for plants the protection of biodiversity species protection and the duty to take the dignity of living beings into consideration when handling plants the constitutional term living beings encompasses animals plants and other organisms at legislative level the gene technology act limits the scope of the term to animals and plants previous discussion within constitutional law relates the term w rde der kreatur dignity of living beings to the value of the individual organism for its own sake
1298190 international workers day despite its origins in the u s is not celebrated here but it is still a holiday in many countries and it is no coincidence that today i e may 1 2006 was chosen to be boycott day el gran paro americano for us immigrants
1298191 in 1884 a dying organization the federation of organized trades and labor unions passed a resolution that eight hours shall constitute a legal days work from and after may 1 1886
1298192 the idea of a general strike for the eighth hour day had caught the imagination of tens of thousands of workers
1298193 gave the signal for law and order forces throughout the country to act
1298194 the mass strike of 1886 was an attempt by the new class of industrial workers to use their power to gain some control over the conditions of their life and work the eight hour strike was both an assertion that the worker was a human being whose life should not be consumed in toil and an attack on the deliberate policy of keeping hours long and unemployment high in order to get the most work for the least wages
1298195 in 1889 the international socialist conference in paris with full knowledge of the american precedent designated may 1 as an eight hour holiday for the workers of the world elaborate ceremonies soon evolved with songs banners uniforms even dioramas to mark the date often with drawings of the haymarket victims uplifted as martyrology
1298196 if i cant dance i wont be part of your revolution
1298197 from the start the occasion attracted and absorbed ritual and symbolic elements notably that of a quasi religious or numinous celebration maifeier a holiday in both sense of the word red flags the only universal symbols of the socialist labor movement were present from the start but so in several countries were flowers the carnation in austria the red paper rose in germany sweet briar and poppy in france and the may symbol of renewal increasingly infiltrated and from the mid 1990s replaced by the lily of the valley whose associations were unpolitical little is known about this language of flowers which to judge by the may day poems in socialist literature also was spontaneously associated with the occasion it certainly struck the key note of may day a time of renewal growth hope and joy we recall the girl with the flowering branch of may associated in popular memory with 1891 may day shootings at fourmies equally may day played a major part in the development of the new socialist iconography of the 1890s in which is spite of the expected emphasis on struggle the note of hope confidence and the approach of a brighter future often expressed in metaphors of plant growth prevailed
1298198 writing in the midst of the devastation of the 1877 railroad strikes a st louis newspaper noted the country was in a feverish state of excitement from boston to san francisco from the lakes to the gulf that feverish state would recur repeatedly over the next two decades between 1877 and 1898 working people undertook a series of fierce battles with their economic and political antagonists craft unionists knights of labor farmers alliance members populists socialists and anarchists struggled for a more egalitarian society and a more just economic system as masses of working people shook their collective fist at the growing visibility of unbridled privilege industrial capitalists dug in their heels in an organized defense of their wealth and power these struggles peaked twice first in 1886 in an eruption of activism organizing and confrontation that came to be know as the great upheaval and second in the 1890s when populism and the homestead and pullman strikes linked farmers and workers together in a loose coalition of resistance at root these epic confrontations of the 1880s and 1890s were working peoples forthright responses to the unprecedented economic and political changes wrought by the new industrial order
1298199 no single factor can be blamed for the global food crisis an unlucky confluence of events over the past several years contributed to soaring prices
1298200 locked in an updated malthusian dilemma of numbers and land
1298201 viewed from the entitlement angle there is nothing extraordinary in the market mechanism taking food away from famine stricken areas to elsewhere market demands are not reflections of biological needs or psychological desires but choices based on exchange entitlement relations if one doesnt have much to exchange one cant demand very much and may thus lose in competition with others whose needs may be a good deal less acute but whose entitlements are stronger in fact in a slump famine such a tendency will be quite common unless other regions have a more severe depression thus food being exported from famine stricken areas e g the irish famine of the 1840s and bangladesh in 1974 as well as several indian famines may be a natural characteristic of the market which respects entitlement rather than needs
1298202 three potential pillars of transnational economic justice the bretton woods institutions as guarantors of global equal treatment and market completion
1298203 a refutation of malthus whose insights have relevance to the modern world
1298204 we may be seeing the beginnings of an attenuated malthusian response in egypt where there have been riots recently over food prices
1298205 against the possible existence of a society all the members of which should live in ease happiness and comparative leisure and feel no anxiety about providing the means of subsistence for themselves and families
1298206 we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america
1298207 malthusians have turned out to be wrong in the past when they extrapolated from events like food price inflation to prophesies about world catastrophe witness the embarrassingly wrong predictions in paul ehrlichs the population bomb about the impending mass world starvation in the 1970s due to what he considered vastly excessive world population growth they are also wrong about this current food price rise because it has nothing to do with population growth and is only a little related to the rapid expansion in world incomes in recent years

1298767 the enquiry is making good progress and we are following up a number of lines of enquiry some significant thanks to the assistance we have received so far from the public
1298768 we believe todays operation may give added impetus to the enquiry as there may well be people in the area who were there around the same time last tuesday
1298769 they may have seen or heard something which they did not consider material at the time and we would hope to be able to jog their memory and elicit information which might prove to be significant
1298770 as is often the case in such enquiries something they might not have thought worth mentioning could turn out to be vital to our efforts in compiling a picture of the events which led up the attack on mr branigan and bringing to justice whoever was responsible for his death
1298771 it may well be that people have been away from aberdeen since last week and have been unaware of our appeals for information
1298772 i would urge anyone who may have information even second hand information which they have heard from someone else to let us know i can assure them their information will be treated in confidence
1298773 we operate much like every other federal law enforcement organization

1298777 the vast middle class strong income growth favourable demographic patterns and organised retailing growth estimated at 40 per cent compounded annual growth rate cagr over the next few years are some of the factors that will drive the retail boom
1298778 the need would be around 15 000 20 000 people in each of these retail chains so in all the requirements would touch 80 000 85 000 every year in the next three to four years of which frontline sales staff will be 80 85 per cent
1298779 will be in retail specific areas like visual merchandising plannogramming the science of maximising space efficiency in the store and supply chain management retail management graduates and general mbas will be wanted
1298780 the percentage of middle class people in metros and tier 2 cities who are buying their own property has increased from about 35 per cent in 2003 to 60 per cent today

1298785 people with a masters in hospital administration mha will be in demand as they are key elements to a hospitals efficiency

1298787 with the rule of thumb being four mha people per hospital around 2 000 hospital chains will need 8 000 such people over the next five years
1298788 another area which would see a demand is pharma regulation and documentation officers
1298789 a lot of portfolio managers not necessarily fund managers but those who manage portfolios beyond a certain amount will be required they will be working with banks and financial institutions the requirement will be for 25 000 30 000 every year

1298791 over 50 000 new jobs are expected to be created in the banking financial services and insurance sector in the current year banks are expected to hire 15 000 20 000 people in the next one year
1298792 over 2 5 lakh rooms will be needed in the next five years to meet the demand from both the domestic and international guests over the next two or three years we will need over 1 lakh more rooms an average of 1 5 service personnel per room will mean an overall shortage of at least 1 5 lakh people across a whole range of hotel related jobs in india especially food production food and beverage services housekeeping and front office operations
1298793 technical maintenance people need to understand aspects such as provision of adequate power supply safety issues water supply sanitation signages and so on for soft services hospitality management experience is preferred

1298795 about 4 000 5 000 people will be directly employed by tv channels every year
1298796 in radio the demand would be for production people anchors technical and distribution sales professionals jobs for 2 500 people in the next two years
1298797 despite stagnation in the industry a lot of project based or contractual hiring and increasing domestic it requirements would lead to organic growth
1298798 professionals who have a holistic knowledge and can do multitasking like coding testing designing and communicating with clients will be in demand
1298799 india will need 4 9 lakh professionals in the it exports market 11 1 lakh in the domestic it industry and 20 5 lakh in the ites bpo sector by 2012

1298838 i think there is something that has brought maths to the fore i think probably because we live in a world with so many lies and so much lack of truth that it has become quite sexy to think of the one thing we have which is the only language that is truthful theres no way of disproving that two plus two equals four and therefore take that to the ultimate much more complicated areas and youre dealing with something which is truthful

1298842 for over 17 years smart has provided healthcare organizations with consumer relationship membership programs that strengthen patient loyalty by providing rewards and benefits accessible by a branded membership card so we thought that if a patient was going to carry a membership card why not have that card carry medical information too after a great deal of research smart recognized smart card technology as a natural extension of our business model and its value to the hospital and patient by adding medical data to secure smart cards we reduce the admissions time and increase patient admittance accuracy with the patients medical data carried in their wallet it allows emergency responders to read the medical data on the card and gather valuable life saving medical information even if the patient is unconscious we expect the patients will embrace using smart cards to manage their data not only at the hospital but as a method of connecting and controlling their personal electronic patient health records
1298843 right now there is a strong movement to empower patients and provide them with access to their medical information their medical information that is the essence of consumer driven healthcare the internet age market has responded with a host of electronic health record portals for patients to build and control their medical records however the problem with the model has been the inability for the providers to access that information during the delivery of services patients have spent time collecting records but have no efficient means to distribute that information

1299302 humans might have caused a very slight amount of this warming very slight but this warming trend is not going to keep on going my belief is that three four years from now the globe will start to cool again as it did from the middle 40s to the middle 70s
1299303 je pense que cette affaire est lun des plus grands canulars jamais impos s au peuple am ricain
1299304 ils nous ont bourr le cr ne depuis vingt ans en commen ant par lhiver nucl aire ndlr lalarmisme sur soi disant refroidissement des ann es 70 voir le b tisier la panique va suivre son cours puis dans 15 ou 20 ans nous regarderons en arri re et nous constaterons que c tait un canular
1299305 jentends beaucoup de jeunes chercheurs me dire quils ny croient pas
1299306 les hommes sont peut tre responsables dune toute petite partie de ce r chauffement vraiment toute petite mais le r chauffement actuel ne va pas durer a mon avis dans trois ou quatre ans le globe va se refroidir de nouveau comme il la fait partir du milieu des ann es 40 jusquau milieu des ann es 70
1299307 the global warming is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda
1299308 laffaire du r chauffement climatique est d guis e comme de la science mais ce nest pas de la science cest de la propagande
1299309 jai t horrifi par ce que jai lu dans la partie ii du rapport
1299310 cette affirmation que le giec est compos des 1500 ou 2500 meilleurs savants du monde vous jetez un coup doeil la bibliographie et vous voyez que cest faux il y a dedans un grand nombre qui ne sont pas des scientifiques
1299311 et pour parvenir faire monter le nombre jusqu 2500 ils sont d recruter des journalistes des gouvernementaux etc nimporte qui proche deux un moment quelconque et on ne demande lavis daucun dentre eux beaucoup dentre eux ne sont pas daccord
1299312 ceux qui sont des sp cialistes mais qui ne sont pas daccord et qui d missionnent jen connais un grand nombre on rajoute simplement leurs noms sur la liste des auteurs et ils font toujours partie de cette liste des fameux

1299314 i have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that lead to this ipcc report
1299315 je nai jamais t le t moin dune plus horrible corruption du processus darbitrage par les pairs
1299316 the evidence that greenhouse forcing cannot be detected in the lower troposphere for long periods shows that the warming which is evident in surface measurements cannot be caused by greenhouse forcing
1299317 le fait que leffet de serre ne peut tre d tect dans la basse troposph re pendant de longues p riodes montre que le r chauffement ndlr de la plan te
1299318 sur la base des faits scientifiques il nest pas possible dexclure lid e que le changement climatique soit d des causes naturelles et il est plausible que lhomme nest pas bl mer
1299319 il faudra encore beaucoup de travail avec beaucoup plus de rigueur scientifique pour am liorer les mod les qui sont actuellement utilis s
1299320 un groupe tr s actif qui s l ve contre les affirmations de la en mati re de r chauffement climatique
1299321 des 5 restants seulement environ 3 6 vient du co2 et quand vous voulez en savoir plus vous trouvez que les tudes ont montr que la contribution anthropog nique venant de lactivit humaine nest que de 3 2 par rapport au co2 naturel
1299322 ainsi si vous multipliez la part de contribution totale de 3 6 du co2 par la fraction due lhomme vous trouvez que la contribution anthropog nique leffet de serre est de 0 117
1299323 je nai aucun doute quune tendance de r chauffement climatique existe
1299324 la nasa est la premi re agence mondiale pour l tude de la terre et les conditions qui contribuent au changement du climat et au r chauffement
1299325 atmospheric co2 is not a primary forcing agent for temperature change
1299326 any cumulative human signal is so far undetectable at a global level and if present is buried deeply in the noise of natural variation
1299327 jusqu pr sent la trace dune intervention humaine est ind tectable au niveau du globe et si elle existe elle est enterr e profond ment dans les fluctuations naturelles
1299328 the intergovernmental panel on climate change had uncovered no evidence the warming of the planet was caused by human activity
1299329 i dont think it is the point whether or not you are paid by the coal or petroleum industry
1299330 le giec na d couvert aucune preuve que le r chauffement de la plan te r sultait de lactivit humaine
1299331 le r le de lexamen par les pairs des articles scientifiques ndlr le peer review a t tout fait exag r et le fait quun chercheur soit financ par lindustrie des carburants fossiles na aucune cons quence sur la validit de ses r sultats
1299332 there are strong indications from solar studies that earths current temperature stasis will be followed by climatic cooling over the next few decades
1299333 a partir des tudes sur le soleil on trouve quil y a de s rieuses indications que la pr sente stabilit de la temp rature ndlr depuis 1998 sera suivie dun refroidissement climatique au cours des prochaines d cennies
1299334 it is extremely dangerous for an unelected and unaccountable body like the ipcc to have a monopoly on climate policy advice to governments and even more so because at heart the ipcc is a political and not a scientific agency
1299335 there is no credible evidence that it is due to mankind and carbon dioxide weve been coming out of a little ice age for 300 years we have not been making very much carbon dioxide for 300 years its been warming up for a long time
1299336 il ny a pas d vidence cr dible que ceci ndlr le r chauffement actuel soit d lhumanit et au co2 nous sortons du petit ge glaciaire depuis 300 ans nous navons pas fabriqu beaucoup de co2 depuis 300 ans le r chauffement se produit depuis tr s longtemps
1299337 humans are polluting the air and adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere but the effect is tiny its like there is an elephant charging in and you worry about the fact that there is a fly sitting on its head its just a total misplacement of emphasis
1299338 consensus doesnt prove anything in science or anywhere else except in democracy maybe
1299339 le consensus ne prouve absolument rien en science comme ailleurs sauf peut tre en d mocratie
1299340 if you want to be an eminent scientist you have to have a lot of grad students and a lot of grants you cant get grants unless you say oh global warming yes yes carbon dioxide
1299341 i do it because as one who has spent many decade studying the subjet professionally i find that there are enormous gaps in the understanding of those making the most strident claims about climatic change in order to read the news rationally the educated reader needs a few keys to quickly sort the patently absurd from the possibly correct
1299342 je fais cela ndlr crire un article d non ant les aberrations couramment propag es en tant que quelquun qui a pass de nombreuses d cades tudier le sujet en professionnel je trouve quil y a un norme d ficit dans la compr hension de ceux qui prof rent les affirmations les plus alarmistes propos du changement climatique sil veut lire les nouvelles de mani re rationnelle le lecteur cultiv a besoin dun certain nombre de clefs pour extraire ce qui est totalement absurde de ce qui peut tre correct

1299355 the ipcc is not going to talk about tipping points its not going to talk about five meter rises in sea level its not going to talk about the next ice age because the gulf stream collapses and its going to have none of the economics of the stern review

1299357 over the last few years a new environmental phenomenon has been constructed the phenomenon of catastrophic climate change
1299358 au cours des derni res ann es un nouveau ph nom ne environnemental est n
1299359 this discourse is now characterised by phrases such as climate change is worse than we thought that we are approaching irreversible tipping in the earths climate and that we are at the point of no return i have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric it seems that it is we the professional climate scientists who are now the catastrophe sceptics how the wheel turns
1299360 ce discours est maintenant agr ment par des phrases telles que
1299361 the language of catastrophe is not the language of science
1299362 as one of the invited expert reviewers for the 2007 ipcc documents i have pointed out the flawed review process used by the ipcc scientists in one of my letters the hill times may 28 2007 i have also pointed out in my letter that an increasing number of scientists are now questioning the hypothesis of ghg induced warming of the earths surface and suggesting a stronger impact of solar variability and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns on the observed temperature increase than previously believed
1299363 en tant quexpert invit pour le rapport 2007 du giec jai insist sur le processus dexamen vici utilis par les scientifiques du giec dans une de mes lettres the hill times 28 mai 2007 dans ma lettre jai aussi attir lattention sur le fait quun nombre croissant de scientifiques sinterrogent sur la validit de lhypoth se du r chauffement de la surface terrestre par les gaz effet de serre il sugg rent une plus forte participation que ce quon lon pensait de la variabilit solaire et de la circulation atmosph rique grande chelle sur les temp ratures observ es
1299364 it is important to first develop an improved understanding of the earths temperature trends and changes before committing millions billions of dollars to reduce greenhouse gases ghgs unfortunately the ipcc climate change documents do not provide an objective assessment of the earths temperature trends and associated climate change
1299365 il est important dam liorer notre compr hension de l volution de la temp rature de la terre et ses variations avant de consacrer des millions des milliards de dollar pour r duire la quantit de gaz effet de serre ges malheureusement les rapports sur le changement climatique du giec ne fournissent pas une valuation objective des tendances de temp rature et du changement climatique associ
1299366 que la v rit scientifique dans le cirque m diatique

1299368 geologists know that the earth climate has done this all the time in its history we also know that man has not been around very long and could not have caused that so we know that there are many natural causes that have cause our climate to change
1299369 les g ologues savent que le climat de la terre a toujours fait cela au cours de son histoire nous savons aussi que lhomme nest pas l depuis longtemps et quil ne pouvait en tre la cause de fait nous savons quil existe de multiples causes naturelles qui ont fait changer notre climat

1299372 it is an abuse of science they are misquoting science they are misusing science they are making predictions of dire consequences in the name of science that will not comme true and science will loose its credibility
1299373 in ten years you wont hear anything about global warming

1299375 i taught my students that co2 was the prime driver of climate change
1299376 jai enseign mes tudiants que le co2 tait le moteur principal du changement climatique
1299377 as the proxy results began to come in we were astounded to find that paleoclimatic and paleoproductivity records were full of cycles that correspond to various sunspots cycles
1299378 au fur et mesure que les r sultats des mesures nous parvenaient nous tions stup faits de constater que les enregistrements pal oclimatiques et de productivit ndlr en poissons taient remplis de cycles qui correspondaient aux diff rentes cycles des t ches solaires
1299379 when i go to a scientific meeting theres a lot of opinions out there theres a lot of discussion about climate change i was at the geological society of america meeting in philadelphia in the fall and i would say that people with my opinion were probably the majority
1299380 quand jassiste une rencontre scientifique il y a des tas dopinions chang es il y a beaucoup de discussions sur le changement climatique
1299381 i think the proof in the pudding based on what media and governments are saying is were about three quarters of the way to disaster with the doubling of co2 in the atmopshere the world should be heating up like crazy by now and its not the temperatures match very closely with the solar cycles
1299382 je pense que le test crucial est bas sur le fait que les medias et les gouvernements disent que nous sommes au trois quarts proches du d sastre d au doublement du co2 dans latmosph re la plan te devrait s chauffer comme une folle en ce moment mais ce nest pas le cas les temp ratures suivent fid lement les variations des cycles solaires

1299386 cest la plus grande arnaque de lhistoire jen suis stup fait constern et absolument outr le r chauffement global cest une arnaque
1299387 these scientists know that if they do research and results are in no way alarming their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish but if they do research that sounds alarms they will become well known and respected and receive scholarly awards and very importantly more research dollars will come flooding their way
1299388 ces scientifiques savent que sils obtiennent des r sultats de recherche qui ne sont absolument pas inqui tants leur travail va demeurer sur des tag res o il se recouvrira de poussi re et aussi que leur carri re va s tioler
1299389 i am not alone in this assessment there are hundreds of other meteorologists many of them phds who are as certain as i am that this global warming frenzy is based on bad science and is not valid
1299390 harmonies discordantes une nouvelle cologie pour le xxi me si cle
1299391 im a scientist who believes in the scientific method and in what facts tell us
1299392 je suis un scientifique qui croit dans la m thode scientifique et dans ce que les faits nous enseignent
1299393 the climate modelers who developed the computer programs that are being used to forecast climate change used to readily admit that the models were crude and not very realistic but were the best that could be done with available computers and programming methods they said our options were to either believe those crude models or believe the opinions of experienced data focused scientists having done a great deal of computer modeling myself i appreciated their acknowledgment of the limits of their methods but i hear no such statements today oddly the forecasts of computer models have become our new reality while facts such as the few extinctions of the past 2 5 million years are pushed aside as if they were not our reality
1299394 the observed pattern of warming comparing surface and atmospheric temperature trends does not show the characteristic fingerprint associated with greenhouse warming the inescapable conclusion is that the human contribution is not significant and that observed increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make only a negligible contribution to climate warming
1299395 la conclusion incontournable est que la contribution humaine est insignifiante et que les augmentations du taux de co2 observ es ainsi que celle des autres gaz effet de serre apportent une contribution n gligeable au r chauffement climatique
1299396 satellite data and independent balloon data agree that atmospheric warming trends do not exceed those of the surface greenhouse models on the other hand demand that atmospheric trend values be 2 3 times greater we have good reason therefore to believe that current climate models greatly overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases
1299397 the current warming trend is simply part of a natural cycle of climate warming and cooling that has been seen in ice cores deep sea sediments stalagmites etc and published in hundreds of papers in peer reviewed journals the mechanism for producing such cyclical climate changes is still under discussion but they are most likely caused by variations in the solar wind and associated magnetic fields that affect the flux of cosmic rays incident on the earths atmosphere in turn such cosmic rays are believed to influence cloudiness and thereby control the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface and thus the climate

1299459 in the 1930s militarism was considered best in the 1960s mass production and mass consumerism then in the 1990s the main topic was the environment every 30 years we switch what we believe in

1299461 cest le soleil qui est responsable du r chauffement climatique global le gaz carbonique ninfluant pratiquement pas sur ce processus

1299463 il a t tabli ce faisant quune augmentation m me importante de la teneur en gaz carbonique dans latmosph re na jamais pr c d un r chauffement du climat de la terre et quau contraire une telle augmentation a toujours suivi une l vation de la temp rature autrement dit m me une accumulation consid rable de gaz carbonique dans latmosph re ne conduit pas pratiquement une augmentation de la temp rature de la terre

1299467 les hommes ne sont pas en mesure dinfluer dune mani re tant soit peu substantielle sur le r chauffement climatique global et un refroidissement profond de la terre suivra in vitablement son r chauffement

1299517 it is therefore necessary to pay attention to trapped radiation in deducing the temperature of the planet as affected by the atmosphere the solar rays penetrate the atmosphere warms the ground which in turns warms the atmosphere by contact et convection currents the heat received is thus stored up in the atmosphere remaining there on account of the very low radiating power of a gas it seems to me very doubtful if the atmosphere is warmed to any great extent by absorbing radiation from the ground even under the most favorable conditions
1299518 il en r sulte quil est n cessaire d tre pr cautionneux quant au pi geage du rayonnement ndlr infra rouge en concluant que la temp rature de la terre est affect e par latmosph re les rayons solaires traversent latmosph re r chauffent le sol qui son tour r chauffe latmosph re par contact et courants de convection la chaleur ainsi re ue est stoqu e dans latmosph re et y reste cause du tr s faible pouvoir radiatif des gaz il me semble tr s douteux que latmosph re puisse se r chauffer notablement en absorbant les radiations ndlr infra rouges mises par les sol m me dans les situations les plus favorables

1299522 some sceptics state that the greenhouse effect cannot work since according to the second law of thermodynamics no radiative energy can be transferred from a colder body the atmosphere to a warmer one the surface however the second law is not violated by the greenhouse effect of course since during the radiative exchange in both directions the net energy flows from the warmth to the cold
1299523 lutilisation de la seconde loi de la thermodynamique par rahmstorf est compl tement fausse

1299639 theres a lot of clubs hundreds of schools for some reason the culture this competitive in your face culture of philadelphia breeds decent coxswains even some of our worst coxswains are better than a lot of other places better coxswains
1299640 ive got six brothers and sisters my mother and father are each one of 10
1299641 growing up there were nine coxswains in my house everyone always had an opinion everyone was always right everyone was always stubborn
1299642 ive never met someone from delaware county who was shy
1299643 you can put 10 people in a room from delaware county pennsylvania and youll have 15 conversations going
1299644 last years boat was a younger boat marcus needed to be a little more of a motivator this is a little more mature group
1299645 my whole goal is to keep him happy thats it
1299646 no matter what it is if he wants something done you get it done in the boat out of the boat anything to keep him happy
1299647 being friends with the guys in the boat thats not important these guys dont want a friend they want to win ned gets more out of them neds got more talent long term hell be good but marcus has more experience
1299648 he doesnt want us to get relaxed and loosen up
1299649 at this level all these boats are really fast its the difference between going 55 miles per hour on a highway and going 100 miles per hour
1299650 for a coxswain its how you manage the race in a calm way its very similar to a jockey youve got to manage this huge horse sometimes youve got to hold this horse back sometimes youve got to let it out and youve got to be aware of where these other horses are
1299651 marcus enjoys running reading and political activism he enjoys 1980s rock techno and house music as well as classical and opera he lists opera singer maria callas as one of his favorite singers marcus reads music and plays the piano he is an avid reader marcus also enjoys kung fu movies he lists his favorite movies as my big fat greek wedding and kill bill vol 1 amp 2 marcus said he is not a hobby guy but is a creature of knowledge he says life is about doing new things so he always likes to try new things
1299652 if im in a bad mood put maria callas on and im in a good mood

1299658 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1299659 i go to bible study just like he does every week
1299660 for me not to be able to forgive him then id just be wasting my time going to bible study

1299670 if people saw me theyd probably think i was a nut
1299671 does it translate into hits i dont know ultimately i have to take a good swing and square the ball up
1299672 but i do know that it makes me feel prepared and not feeling prepared is the worst thing that can happen you need to feel good going into an at bat you cant go up there with any doubt i want to think that preparation is a huge help thats why i do it
1299673 for reserve players some of the resources they have these days are a godsend
1299674 pitchers have just as much information as the hitter does
1299675 you have to force yourself to stay in the game
1299676 its a mind set the years when i had the most success i had a manager who would find a way to get me a start now and then so i could get at bats and stay fresh
1299677 i think that helps greg he can play multiple positions and manager charlie manuel can get him a start now and then to keep him sharp
1299678 the other thing i think helps greg is his work ethic i saw it in spring training he puts in quality time in the cage its not just eyewash hes a tremendous asset to that team
1299679 you get one shot usually late in a game in a critical situation against a tough pitcher its a tough job its almost like being a field goal kicker these guys are specialists dobbs is very good at what he does
1299680 pat being familiar with me and believing in me has been a blessing

1299684 georgia address the legal gaps in church state relations to further religious freedoms
1299685 thats not something that is permitted in the cba collective bargaining agreement its not something we are going to allow and something should they decide to do we will have to manage it the way we would manage any other violation of the collective bargaining agreement i believe we have got great players who have strong levels of integrity and competitive spirit and i believe they will play this game the way they play every other game we will pay the prize money as it was originially dictated as determined by mls ownership if there is something we determine is a violation of the cba we will address it
1299686 the method of science is tried and true it is not perfect its just the best we have and to abandon it with its skeptical protocols is the pathway to a dark age

1299711 stronger consumer protections and clearer prohibitions against unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices are long overdue
1299712 the credit card industry today is rife with unfair deceptive and predatory practices the proposed rule would put an end to some of these abusive practices unless expanded however the proposed rule would leave untouched some of the most blatantly unfair credit card practices in existence today

1299761 we are extremely grateful to the art fund and national museums scotland for their contribution allowing us to purchase this significant work for the people of glasgow
1299762 i think this is an incredibly interesting graphic that would make a stellar t shirt unfortunately i have no idea of the origin does anyone know what designer did this
1299763 it felt really good to get back out there with the guys and to test the waters out so to speak
1299764 when you get an injury as a rookie thats because of fatigue in the legs you get that same exact injury at 35 its because youre old its the same injury i have known that i had six years ago hyperextended the knee
1299765 but since im nearly 35 now its because im older im going to go out and whatever i can give im going to give if i am not the same brian dawkins then well talk about being that brian dawkins if im not im not i anticipate being me
1299766 i only know one way to play that is full speed i have always done it that way
1299767 i put a whole lot of time in early really early
1299768 when i train i dont know what a 35 year old person is supposed to be doing all i know is i need to have my body right and these are things ive done in the past to get my body right
1299769 i dont want him to but our chemistry is great
1299770 ive been here with him for quite some time asante is a little different
1299771 once he gets on the field hell know how were going to try and play it and hell let me know how he wants to play it
1299772 when youre coming into a scheme there are some things where theres not a lot of wiggle room
1299773 those are the types of things asante is trying to learn on the run a little bit where is the wiggle room for me to be able to do what i do best
1299774 i would never ever want to be a liability to my teammates
1299775 i doubt very seriously that when that time comes that i will come back because i would have exhausted everything in this tank
1299776 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
1299777 wherever ive been we had exceptional returners and there was no need for me back there
1299778 ive always been the next guy in line its a good thing those guys never got hurt but i never got a chance
1299779 coming here i knew there wasnt an established guy back there
1299780 i try to relate it to running the ball in the open field but you cant its not the same thing theres really not enough time to start and stop you have to make a decision and go with it
1299781 one thing we were questioning there was whether or not he would able to break off the tackles and hes shown during some live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles
1299782 i havent talked to brett favre and i really havent followed it that close to be honest with you i try not to look at too much of the news im too busy right now
1299783 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything were going for it thats what every move is based on
1299784 part of the reason im real pumped up about this season is finally we have a real healthy donovan mcnabb who looks great out there
1299785 i think andy reid and the personnel people have done a great job of retooling the defense with young fast players to go along with the veteran mix we have were much more athletic on offense
1299786 weve had the best quarterback in the nfc for quite a while thats not the case when hes not 100 percent or not there when hes healthy we have a terrific record
1299787 adapt to where things are at you try to be fair and do contracts when they make sense for the team youre trying to spread it out the best you can so you have the best possible roster
1299788 i think you want every player to be happy especially a professional like brian hes great one of my favorites you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out hopefully this will play out well
1299789 i will say that im very hopeful that lito will have a terrific season hell show us and the league that hes back to the old lito that hes healthy that hes got tremendous playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa
1299790 other players get reps and improve because thats the game of football youve got to prepare hes been hurt before so weve had to prepare anyway any time a player misses the work thats being done and the bonding with teammates even though hes a veteran and a very good player it disappoints me
1299791 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1299792 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1299793 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1299794 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl expletive him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1299795 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things some things im embarrassed to talk about
1299796 but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1299797 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1299798 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1299799 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse
1299800 some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1299801 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1299802 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1299803 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1299804 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont say everything is ok if it isnt
1299805 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1299806 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1299807 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1299808 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally
1299809 i think that was just part of me trying to identify myself
1299810 ive always felt like i was different i feel like im an abstract person and i still wonder who shawn andrews is thats why you always see me joking around being around people and singing activates my fun side
1299811 at the end of the day this doesnt take away from my fun side but it has for the time being
1299812 for a few weeks every four years nations around the world put aside their differences and focus on the excitement and drama of olympic competition
1299813 on infoplease we offer olympic enthusiasts a unique combination of up to date results on the current games and resources to put the competition into a historical context and build a deeper understanding of the significance of this global celebration of athletic ability and world unity
1299814 which athletes or countries typically win the most olympic game medals
1299815 how has the u s team fared overall in the summer olympic games
1299816 they hate me smoking i find that as a blessing in disguise if they had no problems i would have continued smoking
1299817 treten sie so oft wie m glich vor der masse auf
1299818 we sold 8 327 worth of lennys stuff and fuck him were keeping it
1299819 im shocked when i paid for the thing and someone else is filling it its inconvenient and distressing and i was so cross
1299820 its an inconvenience as ive got a lot of rubble upstairs that i cant put in my skip i would tell other people to get a skip with covers
1299821 i phoned scarborough council and they told me i would be prosecuted if i took anything out and dumped it on the side of the road
1299822 if a resident employs a private contractor to help dispose of their waste then it is the residents responsibility to keep it secure
1299823 the council and ultimately the council tax payer cannot be held responsible for securing private skips within the borough
1299824 while we sympathise with this resident we have limited powers in much the same way with regards to fly tipping on private land
1299825 if however a skip has been placed on the public highway and is causing a defined nuisance for example obstruction to other road users then action may be undertaken by the highways authority depending upon the circumstances
1299826 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1299827 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1299828 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1299829 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1299830 its private its between us and its not a big deal
1299831 i do my housework in the nude it gives me an incentive to clean the mirrors as quickly as possible
1299832 my idea of rebooting is kicking somebody in the butt twice
1299833 i never wanted to leave the club it is my club and im very happy here my game is developing all the time
1299834 a three year deal not only gives me security but the chance to concentrate on my rugby doing my best for the team instead of thinking about next year and what i am going to be doing
