2070032 turning to inflation the governors open letter to the chancellor on june 16 signalled that cpi consumer price index inflation was expected to rise sharply in the second half of the year to above 4
2070033 since then inflationary pressures have continued to build at a stronger rate than previously anticipated and the june cpi figure came in higher than the mpc were expecting at 3 8
2070034 mounting evidence of weakening economic activity which will see inflation fall back further down the line current inflationary pressures are expected to keep interest rate cuts off the mpcs agenda until next year
2070035 we still expect interest rates to remain on hold at 5 for the rest of the year meanwhile financial markets have continued to scale back their expectations of interest rate rises and also point towards rates remaining on hold for the rest of the year

2070071 we should respond to hamlet himself as a funny fast sardonic headstrong prince with a streak of fatal prevarication and sense of his own intellectual superiority and that we certainly do
2070072 maybe its because hes tennant such a tv pin up or maybe his interpretation of hamlet light on power politics heavier on personal hiatus is likely to appeal more to the female mind

2070121 more and more investors are coming to the conclusion that this could be a much more protracted economic downturn than had originally been thought
2070122 the views that oil prices could only go onwards and upwards have been obviously turned around on expectations now that softer growth will result in some reduction in demand for commodities
2070123 at least temporarily this is a commodity play our currency is viewed as a proxy for commodity prices and oil is the bellwether here

2070145 we use the waste gases that would otherwise be put up a boiler stack or kiln stack
2070146 the problems with welded tanks be came apparent and increasingly troublesome
2070147 there was the excessive lead time required to get them ready for use
2070148 one major reason it took 10 to 12 weeks was that the interior and exterior coatings couldnt be applied until the tanks were welded together
2070149 a four coat system was developed for the exterior coating so painting alone took 4 to 5 weeks
2070150 we were at the mercy of the quality of painter available that day we couldnt control that and the coating would have to air cure so it wouldnt be as tough as a factory baked on coating
2070151 i dont know how you quantify the benefit of working with the same supplier team each time but its a very important efficiency that flows straight to the bottom line
2070152 we knew if we could reduce the erection time cost would drop
2070153 it was like starting over in every city without the benefit of the experience from each previous installation
2070154 pcc is stored ideally at about 130 f gallagher said
2070155 we started seeing pcc react with the interior paints pigment at this temperature and become contaminated pcc particles are very bright white any kind of rust or pigment contaminates it and dulls the brightness because pcc is used as a brightener this became a critical problem
2070156 we were primarily comparing welded to bolted carbon steel tanks
2070157 but we also considered a variety of coatings and we looked at stainless steel tanks which dont need coatings
2070158 we had been buying their bolted silos for lime storage
2070159 it was a natural decision to buy from them going with a bolted factory coated tank no matter who made it was an obvious choice we had worked with them before and were comfortable with the material they use to coat the tanks
2070160 now we can install all of our silos and tanks around the world with consistent labor which is important to us
2070161 erecting all of the silos and tanks at a new satellite plant takes about 5 to 6 weeks now
2070162 it varies because some installations have 5 storage vessels some have 20 but compared with an equivalent number of welded tanks the bolted units go up in about half the time they used to
2070163 all we have to do now is put gaskets on flanges put bolts through them and tighten nuts
2070164 we dont have to get a guy in there with welding equipment a sandblaster or a paint gun were no longer at the mercy of so many variables
2070165 the time and cost of getting these tanks ordered erected and operational is half what we used to experience
2070166 this in turn helps us streamline the process of getting these plants up and running
2070167 with the factory coated bolted tanks weve been storing the pcc at temperatures from 130 f to 170 f with no coating breakdown or pcc contamination
2070168 before when we put together proposals for building satellite plants around the world we never knew exactly what the pcc tanks were going to cost us
2070169 now wherever the installation is we know exactly what the cost will be all we have to do is add shipping thats a real benefit identifying project costs

2070205 is it possible to find a single instance in scripture of accepted worship that was not prescribed by god
2070206 humanly devised ceremonies are a bold affront to gods power honor and freedom through them men attempt to worship god as they please and to bind his power to specific situations consequently calvin deals with ceremonies as dangerous distractions that only serve to confuse man and rob god of his majesty
2070207 calvin also carries his analysis of the psychology of idolatry to the social level
2070208 how by mutual persuasion men urge one another to defend superstition and the worship of idols
2070209 calvin also argues that people remain steeped in idolatry out of habit and a false sense of awe resulting from the antiquity of their beliefs
2070210 just as a maistre fifi mocks those who hold their noses in his presence because he has handled filth for so long that he can no longer smell his own foulness so likewise do idolaters make light of those who are offended by a stench they cannot themselves recognize hardened by habit they sit in their own excrement and yet believe they are surrounded by roses
2070211 a warning against the false and dangerous views of james jordan concerning worship
2070212 the principle that the church hath power to institute any thing or ceremony belonging to the worship of god either as to matter or manner beyond the observance of such circumstances as necessarily attend such ordinances as christ himself hath instituted lies at the bottom of all the horrible superstition and idolatry of all the confusion blood persecution and wars that have for so long a season spread themselves over the face of the christian world

2070250 the fact is that people with disabilities are dying silently from aids
2070251 we have no idea exactly how many people with disabilities are hiv positive how many are educated about the risks of hiv aids or how many are able to access treatment
2070252 this lack of data highlights the neglect of people with disabilities and makes it extremely difficult to obtain funding or to strategically design policies and programming to reach this population the fact is that people with disabilities are dying silently of aids
2070253 if people with disabilities are left out of aids research policies and programming then we are relegating 10 per cent of the worlds population to the far margins of the aids response
2070254 disability like hiv aids disproportionately harms women and is intricately intertwined with poverty and social and economic marginalization
2070255 women with pre existing disabilities are often already dependent on caregivers whether physically economically or both contracting hiv only worsens their situation some may be punished for having the nerve to be sexually active and may lose what little social support they have this additional layer of stigma further exacerbates their poverty and marginalization

2070267 in response to a large number of complaints from local residents we have met with paul goggins in an attempt to end the practice of low flying british army helicopters
2070268 it is not enough to be told that the helicopter activity is not as has been our previous experience to spy to terrorise and invade our lives but rather to train new british army personnel to conduct this same activity in other parts of the world
2070269 while we have no doubt that the loughs and mountains within the south derry area provide an excellent training ground its simply unacceptable that people who have suffered so much at the hands of the british army should be confronted on a regular basis with an activity we thought was consigned to the past
2070270 much of this activity is carried out at night and close to the ground which not only frightens people particularly those living alone but spooks livestock and horses and has already led to serious injury

2070290 i think honestly that im better than he is in every single aspect of the game
2070291 i just have a very stubborn attitude where i wont allow myself to fail
2070292 its my turn to start my legacy and my reign
2070293 he fitch has good cardio he trains hard but hes built to go medium for a long period of time so he can keep going at a good pace for a very long time but he cant go at a very very high pace for a long time georges has more power more athletic ability so georges can go explode and then recover explode and recover fitch is like strong steady just plodding along basically what he does is he wears you out over time georges is explosive
2070294 every time i talk to fitch and his camp theyre very confident they can beat gsp
2070295 he thinks people dont realize how tough he is until they fight him hes going to get in there hes going to outwork gsp and grind out a win
2070296 when i talk to people about how they feel about gsp basically what people think is gsp eats wrestlers alive chews them up and spits them out and that has been his track record and he seems very mentally there very strong mentally on top of his game
2070297 im not really that good of a wrestler im a good fighter but to stereotype me as a wrestler is foolish a little bit so i hope hes considering me just a wrestler because then hes in for a rude awakening on saturday night
2070298 the way i explain it to people is if brazilian jiu jitsu was a banana split then guerilla jiu jitsu is a banana split with whipped cream on top hot fudge nuts and a cherry
2070299 jon fitch hes like a new breed of mixed martial arts fighter hes not like the old school guys of course hes a great wrestler thats his first background but hes very good standing up and on the ground as well so he brings a lot more problems to the table than the other guys ive fought in the past im going to have to use a lot more tools than ive been using in the past but i truly believe that fighting wrestlers is my speciality thats the type of people that im the best to fight when i fight wrestlers i always do very well
2070300 the top level guys the guys that are at the top are professionals or behaving as professionals the guys who talk trash and the guys who spew all that garbage they dont last they do that stuff because they need that to get attention because they suck as fighters
2070301 i think jon fitch poses a whole bunch of problems for georges st pierre
2070302 he does a lot of things well that georges does well hes a solid wrestler hes really great at scrambling he has good standup and he has good submissions so theres no one area where i really feel that georges can go out there and exploit jon fitch i think its just going to boil down to who has the better fight on that night
2070303 jon fitch is no pushover at all i think some people are writing him off but jon fitch i tell you he does everything that gsp can do i just think gsp may just have an edge kind of everywhere
2070304 youve got a guy whos a little more polished in robinson like georges youve got a guy thats beating everybody like lamotta did

2070436 deputy first minister martin mcguinness chaired yesterdays meeting between newly appointed nwgi joint chair mr frank duffy and a north west sinn f in delegation
2070437 we brought a very clear message that the intergovernmental interdepartmental body which has been charged with driving forward the regeneration of this part of ireland through integrated cross border strategies must now concentrate on delivery on the ground for areas like strabane district and its donegal hinterlands which have borne the brunt of marganilization and neglect down through the years
2070438 among the issues we specifically raised with the nwgi joint chair in relation to the needs of the strabane donegal corridor were the development of the further education sector in strabane the re locatation of public sector jobs to the area investment to ensure that the untapped tourist potential of the area is fully realised and assistance towards collaborative projects between the strabane lifford and derg finn areas
2070439 the new nwgi chair took on board the need to address specific local needs in strabane and its donegal hinterlands as part of an overall integrated regeneration strategy for the north west and sinn fein will be keeping these issues firmly on the agenda so that people in this area can see the work of the gateway initiative translating into tangible benefits on the ground

2070449 he was arrested at the airport in riyadh when he was on his way back to bahrain and we did not know about his arrest until the next day
2070450 for four months he was interrogated and kept chained up in solitary confinement
2070451 if he is convicted of anything the saudi authorities should bring him back to his country to serve his sentence

2070471 if there is a threat of a lack of liquidity in the firm why are they still paying dividends at all
2070472 it seems to me that we passed legislation giving them the right to borrow from us and now theyre taking out money while were potentially putting money in

2070478 richard rider novas alter ego is targeted for termination as the last surviving nova centurion and the repository of the xandarian worldmind with whom the skrulls have a long standing grudge since the xandar skrull wars
2070479 super skrull is busy finding out what the skrulls are up to when he accidentally discovers that they have targeted his old comrade nova for termination then hes got a choice to make
2070480 super skrull is all but passed by as the skrulls believe he is now obsolete and redundant to their schemes
2070481 also klrt is not happy with the invasion plans as he has witnessed two cosmic scale conflicts and does not wish his own people to take the galaxy into a third
2070482 of course klrt is a skrull and nothing is as it may seem he may have plans of his own
2070483 klrt is a firm believer in the skrull warrior code but he sees that as an intensely honorable thing and not something to be perverted by overzealous jihadist ambitions
2070484 that and he has additional personal issues regarding the fact that his son is dead but shes alive think of it as a sort of reverse survivors guilt instead its anger on his part that she was the one who survived while his son perished

2070486 the events of secret invasion will challenge those issues but they will come through it stronger
2070487 however that isnt to say that future ramifications of secret invasion wont impact on other alliances of jens such as the lady liberators
2070488 klrt is a strong and independent character so were sure he will return to the cosmic stage before too long
2070489 the question will be whose side will he be on
2070490 he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself

2070519 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing

2070543 fluoridation is an attempt by industry to camouflage their deadliest pollutant with government officials and madison avenue advertisers beating the drums the fluoridation empire is like a castle built on quicksand
2070544 toxicity of fluorides in relation to their use in dentistry
2070545 some of the basic and necessary metabolic processes in the cell are stopped by concentrations of fluorides such as are found in acute poisoning these changes are comparable to those seen in high grade anoxia lack of sufficient oxygen in the body tissues and are the basis for describing fluorides as general protoplasmic poisons
2070546 the real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination control and loss of liberty
2070547 repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individuals power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of the brain thus making him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him
2070548 i am appalled at the prospect of using water as a vehicle for drugs fluoride is a corrosive poison that will produce serious effects on a long term basis any attempt to use water this way is deplorable
2070549 i say this in all earnestness and sincerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years research into the chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology of fluorides any person who drinks artificially fluoridated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person

2070592 with the picture in hand the theorem is much simpler the radii of the blue circles sum to the radius of the orange circle one of the advantages of a demonstration over a picture is that by moving the controls we can see at a glance the range of situations covered by the theorem the circles and triangles flex together in an intricate dance complicated to describe but easy and elegant to see but beyond mere visual confirmation of what we already know to be true this advantage extends to the power to easily consider situations not covered by the theorem with the sliders adjusted so that f is inside the triangle abc the radius of the orange circle is no longer the sum of the radii of the blue circles which is why the theorem stipulates that f is outside of abc upon closer examination and some jiggling of the controls it becomes clear that there is still a relationship among the four radii however it is now the case that thus the ability to quickly explore a wide range of mathematical possibilities visually leads to a generalization of the theorem whether f is inside or outside abc the triangles inradius the radius of the orange circle can be computed from the radii of the blue circles it is just necessary to adjust the formula based on the location of f the radii of four incircles

2070832 currently the police may hold suspected terrorists for up to 28 days before having to charge or release them the government wishes to extend this time limit
2070833 do you support or oppose extending the time limit to 42 days
2070834 at present once someone is charged with a criminal offence the police are not allowed to question them further on that or any related offence
2070835 if you had to choose between these three options which would you prefer
2070836 we should keep the present 28 day limit and also keep the rule that prevents the police from questioning suspects after they have been charged
2070837 the police should continue to be barred from questioning suspects after they have been charged but the time limit for holding suspects without charge should be raised to 42 days
2070838 the 28 day limit should remain but the police should be allowed to question suspects further after they have been charged if the police obtain fresh evidence on related offences

2070856 that hits us first with private donations because theyre feeling more nervous and theyre not quite as generous
2070857 theres a lot of variety each kid can find something they absolutely love and the fact that its free that really makes a big difference for me
2070858 you get to know your kids a little better when you see the art projects they are doing
2070859 your brain actually works a little more efficiently when you go to look at math and science so its actually a brain builder to be artistic and to express yourself

2070864 when i was trying to talk it wasnt coming out the way i wanted it to sound
2070865 and there was a lot of people there and it seemed like many didnt even need to be there just colds and flu and stuff like that
2070866 my main objective is to be professional but to kill him
2070867 its sad to say but right after my last fight against jameel mccline
2070868 a reporter asked me about me going back to holding my opponent its easy for them to say that because they think thats my style there are two fighters in the ring and i wasnt the one holding reporters are just used it i guess but im challenging them to a bet they can watch my last fight against mccline as well as my first against valuev and then we can make a bet about who will hold more me or valuev it can be by the round or the entire fight so much money per hold differential or a flat rate if i hold more ill make a donation to the charity of the reporters choice if valuev holds more the reporter has to make a donation to my charity they can have as many reporters as they want betting for what ever amount they can choose im giving them a chance to put their money where their mouths are then finally they will realize that i dont fight like i used to no more clutching and grabbing for me
2070869 weve been working hard to make sure that i stay focused theres a lot less stress with manny than at my old training camps my sparring partners are working out good
2070870 i hope i dont have to knockdown valuev every round to get a split decision
2070871 i have to stay inside and busy like in our last fight but this time i need to throw better combinations and give him different angles we dont want to let him just stand still and throw punches im going to make him move ill be taking the fight to him but more around him to see what he can do when he has to move
2070872 all we can say is that a person who has reason to be concerned about their risk of developing this cancer which is relatively rare but quite deadly should maintain a normal weight and eat their fruit and vegetables
2070873 this is a preliminary but intriguing finding because it suggests that something in the vitamins may fuel pancreatic cancer growth
2070874 if there is a dormant tumor folate and other similar vitamins may stimulate growth
2070875 people think that dietary intake of these nutrients reflects a lifelong healthy eating habit and in those cases these nutrients may be protective but they could have an opposite effect if they are used in a person with an occult cancer
2070876 it might all depend on whether a person is cancer free at the time they start using these nutrients
2070877 women who have eaten soy all their lives such as people in asia have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer but some studies have found that increased soy intake in women who have not eaten it before appears to be harmful
2070878 dietary vitamin b6 b12 and folate may decrease pancreatic cancer risk among lean people
2070879 i mean it was just incredible i never saw anything like it
2070880 we were up to our waist in the water and the lady wanted us to carry her out and the lightning was striking around us and we actually just put the whole family in a fire truck and drove them out of the water in a fire truck
2070881 the current on this side of the house is just crazy
2070882 we could see the kids toys going down and the fence and rocks it was very scary

2070895 after a spate of negative roles finally i have got to play characters that have no vampish traits i am enjoying every bit of it
2070896 it gives me a high whenever i am addressed as dr kirti who is obsessed with discipline while at work but is totally bindaas the moment she steps out of the hospital i just love the different shades of her character
2070897 whenever i have auditioned the negative role would automatically come to me to be honest i enjoyed doing that to the hilt its a challenge to play a vamp there is a lot of scope to perform play with the eyes and experiment with clothes and looks i cant play a dumb doll or do too much of rona dhona like the sanskari bahu in the saasbahu serials
2070898 it could have been the turning point in my career but i decided against it as the role demanded some very bold scenes i steer clear of exposure i want to be known for my acting skills

2070906 at this point we really have very little else to report
2070907 ik hoop dat onze synagoge een leidende rol kan spelen in het europese jodendom en een uithangbord wordt voor onze geschiedenis en onze waarden
2070908 de unie heeft begrepen dat de europese burger niet alleen oplossingen wil voor de economische problemen hij hunkert ook naar het spirituele daarom brengt barroso elk jaar de religieuze leiders samen om naar hen te luisteren en met hen te praten
2070909 de koningsstraat werd in die optiek aangelegd en daarin heeft de synagoge haar plaats
2070910 maar daarnaast wordt ze een vitrine van het europese jodendom
2070911 dat wil zeggen dat er activiteiten komen om het europese jodendom beter bekend te maken concerten colloquia debatten en veel meer
2070912 de joodse gemeenschap in brussel is ongeveer vijftig zestigduizend mensen groot
2070913 net als bij de kerken dalen de bezoekersaantallen maar omdat we een minderheid zijn is het jodendom aanhangen nog altijd een manier om je te manifesteren
2070914 accuscore ran 10 000 game simulations and determined that the bucs would have won 3 to 4 more games this season with favre than garcia
2070915 i think they were just going to alternate those guys at the whim of the media the coaching staff and the front office so maybe its good that he gets a clean break

2070928 im scared every time i go into the ring but its how you handle it
2070929 we finally got a fight that acquitted the build up if margarito was hit by lightning youd take the lightning to the hospital margarito is one of the toughest ive ever seen joshua clottey fought him and broke both hands on his head i think his next fight is against godzilla the worst thing he could have done was win the fight as he did cause who in the hell wants to fight him now not paul williams maybe godzilla i dont know
2070930 i have never seen this before where they sold the flags on site of both mexico and puerto rico they were waving them and waving them it really was electric it was a wonderful atmosphere and a great fight the irony was half the interviewers i talked to called him margarita other than margarito as if he was a drink they didnt know who the hell he was this fight did much better than expectations
2070931 whereas pacquiao diaz did under 200 000 pay per view buys this did over 425 000 one of the biggest fights and they were right on buying it people were calling this fight the fight of the decade theres only been one decade in this century its a fight of the century youve got 2009 on and we knew going in how good this was going to be
2070932 i dont know if boxing needed this but they got it and hopefully will re inspire others to pay attention to what we have which is a great sport

2070948 het brusselse overheidsgeld moet niet naar de tien procent rijkste inwoners gaan maar eerst en vooral naar de tien procent armste
2070949 ik pleit voor een omkadering van de huurprijzen waarbij dak en muurisolatie en de beglazing van een appartement mee in rekening gebracht worden men zou referentiehuurprijzen moeten opstellen op basis van grootte kwaliteit comfort en energiezuinigheid eigenaars die verhuren tegen de referentieprijs kunnen rekenen op renovatiepremies de andere niet

2070965 in training camp the door is open for players to make the team
2070966 thats the opportunity well give him he said he plans to come in early and work out with the guys he has the right mind set
2070967 we have talked about a contract but it makes sense for him to come to training camp for the tryout and then us talk about a contract
2070968 this is more of a bread i should bake it in a loaf pan
2070969 he called me a rapist and a recluse im not a recluse
2070970 yes yeah i am hes taking a very dangerous fight at this time in his career he obviously cant need the money but i really dont know what hes thinking maybe hes trying to save face after the calzaghe fight i just think they picked a bad fight
2070971 neither one impressed me actually i just think bernard tries to go through 12 rounds of every fight then screams to the world that he won the fight if thats his gameplan here then he picked the wrong gameplan
2070972 you know hes got some ol dirty tricks hes a veteran hes a future hall of famer he brings a lot of experience to the ring but the old bernard hopkins maybe this bernard hopkins at this age with the work rate and the work ethic of kelly its not gonna happen
2070973 well kelly throws 100 punches a round bernard throws 17 20 25 punches a round can you at that age work three minutes for every round from the get go and kelly doesnt slap he doesnt tap people he hits hard i just think our youth and our work rate will be way too much for bernard
2070974 obviously top rank kelly will fight anybody we tried calzaghe but calzaghe chose roy jones
2070975 we tried paul williams too a lot of these guys their way to get out of the fight is to just price themselves out of the fight then say well i tried you tried and you asked for a ridiculous amount of money they offered paul williams probably more money than hes made in his career he turned it down his people turned it down i mean bernard is a legend well fight him
2070976 noooo no not at all kelly wants to fight the best out there and at this time bernard stepped up to the plate
2070977 nooo listen you cant talk kelly to death you cant beat kelly by talking to him you gotta go in there and fight him he can say all he wants his people can say what they want to say but on october 18 bernard gotta step in that ring and hes gotta go face to face with kelly

2070989 it turnovers is always big in every game we play

2070991 they did a lot of different things on second down and made some good adjustments
2070992 this is an exciting development and one that addresses important e discovery challenges facing todays forensics professionals including processing speed and cost
2070993 the upcoming line of perlustro products which have integrated a newly designed platform of passware advanced decryption tools will provide forensically sound access to data and will do so more quickly and less expensively than competing technologies
2070994 working with passwares team we were able to create a cost effective solution that will dramatically increase the speed of every aspect of digital investigations
2070995 by combining perlustros revolutionary forensics toolset with the passware tools and with microsofts sql server 64 which is a critical component of perlustros ilook toolbase we created a truly winning combination and one that were excited to share with the government and commercial forensics community

2071045 were not talking highs of 72 but were also not talking about really impressive heat either
2071046 raised the rate to reduce as much as possible the spreading of the high consumer price growth into inflation expectations
2071047 consumer price inflation has picked up its pace due to the direct and spillover effects from high oil prices
2071048 its a common saying that the longer high inflation lasts the bigger the risk the economy will face
2071049 the largest risk to the south korean economy since the 1997 87 financial crisis
2071050 consumer prices are expected to remain high for a considerable time given lingering fallout from higher oil prices and a possible gain in public utility charges
2071051 we see more risks of inflationary pressure than those of economic slowdown
2071052 todays rate hike seems as a preemptive measure to cope with inflationary pressure

2071055 what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it
2071056 whoever is born after us for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto
2071057 if anyone after publicly recognizing these dogmas behaves as if he does not believe them let him be punished by death he has committed the worst of all crimes that of lying before the law
2071058 some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them this may seem an extraordinary claim but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live
2071059 what do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it
2071060 what i believe though cannot yet prove is that belief is a content independent process which is to say that beliefs about god to the degree that they are really believed are the same as beliefs about numbers penguins tofu or anything else
2071061 how shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water is there for us to clean ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it there has never been a greater deed and whoever is born after us for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto

2071080 dakota is a professional private investigator so she fits perfectly in matt and foggys world because almost all lawyers have pis they work with especially defense attorneys
2071081 her history and the way shes been portrayed in the past is what made me want to bring her into our cast
2071082 shes always been a tough character with a sharp wit the fact that shes been used so infrequently did make her more appealing in a way though because so much is still unknown about her
2071083 i think the only major change we made was getting her dad out of his wheelchair we gave him a cane though as a nod to that earlier version
2071084 dakotas impact on matt nudging him back toward who hes supposed to be will have a major effect on him and the direction of the book from this point on
2071085 big changes and danger are on their way and dakotas going to be front and center throughout it all
2071086 i wanted to work with greg again for his insight and so he could help me look at daredevil from different angles before i started the next big arc and it really helped me
2071087 its always a treat to write one of the big iconic characters and daredevil certainly is one of them
2071088 that said this is eds book and from the start i really felt my job was to support him and michael lark as best as i could to go where ed pointed and write what he suggested its been a helluva lot of fun
2071089 but as far as the regular book goes man im hoping ed and michael stay on the title for a long time to been loving what theyre doing and im looking forward to what comes next as much as everybody else ed wouldnt tell me anything
2071090 but its been a long time coming for him so i think all dd fans will love the final scenes of this issue

2071103 thats both a function of the price and the amount of natural gas thats being produced across the state
2071104 its really providing an economic boost to west virginia and along with the other extractive resources one of the reasons why west virginia is not suffering the way some other states are during this economic downturn in the country
2071105 natural gas production has the least footprint of any of those production methods and youre seeing with the new types of horizontal drilling maybe five or six wells being drilled on the same pad
2071106 youre seeing all kinds of things happen that are causing us to be even friendlier to the environment
2071107 todos sabemos que el gobierno no es solamente el responsable de algunos incrementos de precios de los que s tienen una enorme responsabilidad los empresarios
2071108 me parece que los empresarios en la argentina tienen que tener mayor responsabilidad porque todos sabemos que el gobierno no es solamente el responsable de algunos incrementos de precios de los que s tienen una enorme responsabilidad los empresarios
2071109 el tema de los precios es algo de lo que tenemos que ocuparnos todos
2071110 desde el gobierno est claro su parte de responsabilidad y se est n tomando acciones para corregir los desfasajes

2071112 algunos no creen en el estado sino que creen en el mercado
2071113 nosotros creemos en la injerencia del estado para regular muchas veces a mercados que son oligopolios y monop licos y que se abusan de las condiciones preponderantes que tienen en el mercado e incrementan los precios
2071114 nosotros tenemos que luchar para que en el pa s todos podamos desarrollarnos en armon a y evitar que un grupo de vivos como lo han hecho hist ricamente en la argentina acusando al gobierno se aprovechen de los recursos del pueblo argentino
2071115 habr a que preguntarle a cada uno de los empresarios que quieren acusar al gobierno del corrimiento de los precios cual es el aumento que ellos pusieron sobre cada uno de los productos que producen

2071120 we began promoting ddgs in korea in 2003 even though it was not part of our regular program at the time
2071121 in 2004 we invited dr jerry shurson a professor of animal science at the university of minnesota to lead a seminar on the nutritional value of ddgs we invited potential users to attend several other consultants have held successful workshops in korea since then and we are now using local consultants to provide one on one consultations with feed and livestock end users
2071122 i think this growth of ddgs exports to korea will continue
2071123 current feed prices may be a factor but i think more importantly koreas feed millers have a better understanding about the feed value of ddgs compared to what they knew in the past
2071124 weve got to totally analyze this whole incident and make some good things come out of it

2071137 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2071138 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2071139 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not
2071140 if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2071141 this rule permits health care providers to refuse to perform any service they deem morally objectionable which raises critical questions about access to all health care services

2071151 being an illegal immigrant is seen as a crime and that bothers me

2071158 hiv aids in the latino communities has reached a crisis level representing only 15 3 of the population in the u s and its territories latinos now constitute 22 of the hiv aids cases diagnosed in 2006
2071159 for the latino commission on aids to share the seriousness of this health crisis for latinos in the united states the global community needs to be aware of these facts our struggles and our commitment to advocate for a comprehensive response for those impacted by hiv aids i will continue advocating for all individuals to routinely test for hiv for culturally competent prevention services and access to care we all deserve that
2071160 the prevention and access to care needs of latinos are complex and diverse and we need leadership in this fight i hope that the current us administration and the next president of the united states will take actions in formulating a robust domestic aids agenda sensitive to the needs of all communities and relevant to the cultures of the hispanic communities
2071161 we need aids awareness both in spanish and english in our community hiv is totally preventable we need to reach every segment of our communities in rural and urban areas
2071162 we call for a commitment at all levels in confronting stigma associated with hiv aids

2071167 as a normative way of socializing for gay men online cruising is a disaster we need to recognize its effects including its tendency to isolate us encourage objectification and diminish our sense of lifes nonsexual possibilities as disasters we need to recognize that too many of us too much of the time are cruising online because it is easier and feels safer than thinking about the love we are missing and the power we do not have

2071191 on the east side i dont know if there were any big snubs i mean some people wanted jose calderon jose calderon who come on man this is all star people when ive seen some of the names that are being thrown around on the ticker as snubs its killing me i understand calderon has the best assist turnover ratio in the league but you know whats funny all back up point guards have the best assist turnover ratios screw it kevin ollie should be an all star then for like five or six years ollie was no 1 in assist turnover ratio an all star is an all star hes playing at a high level that means if you take him off the team that team should fall down if hes that one guy an all star means that he is dominating the game of basketball its not even about numbers necessarily its about dominating
2071192 hes playing great over the years you can see his development as a player and hes really playing well t j might lose that spot to him but i dont know who knows as a backup or as a starter right now hes playing great basketball i watched calderon last week and he had a really good game you can take him out of being a backup hes a starter now hes a starter in this league you know what with jason kidd gone and if calderon plays how hes playing next year and theyre winning in toronto and hes still the starter he might have a shot at being an all star he might have a crack at it
2071193 gasol is a very skilled player who can score in the low post and with mid range shots besides that he is a great passer for his size plays solid defense and rebounds well

2071229 mentre allah che vi ha creati voi e ci che fabbricate
2071230 non hanno considerato il regno dei cieli e della terra e tutto ci che allah ha creato
2071231 allah colui che ha creato i cieli e la terra e che fa scendere lacqua dal cielo e suo tramite suscita frutti per il vostro sostentamento vi ha messo a disposizione le navi che scivolano sul mare per volont sua e vi ha messo a disposizione i fiumi vi ha messo a disposizione il sole e la luna che gravitano con regolarit e vi ha messo a disposizione la notte e il giorno e vi ha dato parte di tutto quel che gli avete chiesto se voleste contare i doni di allah non potreste enumerarli

2071237 i would certainly not want to start from scratch but from a completely different level and this can be done by acquiring another company i am interested and ive already held talks on the market

2071239 the manager in charge with creation is a business driver and for us he is of particular importance as were counting on creation we want to expand in the atl area promotion on tv the radio printed press outdoor and indoor advertising where we are less experienced the agency is known for btl below the line services specialising in marketing consultancy and event organisation
2071240 no change was by far the market consensus despite the minutes from the previous meeting showing a three way split
2071241 the reality is that despite a clearly slowing economy the twin evil of rising inflation simply rules out any possibility of a majority decision in favour of a cut or a hike in rates for now
2071242 but i am not sure that underlying sentiment has improved greatly there is still deteriorating economic news rather than people actively chasing the stocks for good news i think they are just unwinding the risk positions

2071245 this season we will have more experience than weve had in the past
2071246 we have a lot of returning players coming off of the success of last year
2071247 one of our goals was to bring in some more people who can play defense
2071248 the top of the league is digging 19 balls per game and were at 16 putting us in the middle of the pack on defense thats one of the areas we really want to improve on
2071249 im really excited about her experience on the court as a leader hopefully it goes without saying that elswick will come back and have a great senior season
2071250 even better is that we can have a practice and have two quality setters two people that can get the job done not only that erika who did not play as much is capable of leading this team on and off the floor they help each other out in matches and practices and they work extremely well together they compete but its a healthy competition
2071251 arnold will also train as a setter along with right side
2071252 shes got to be ready to run the show come spring so well definitely have her setting its a great opportunity for her to get on the court at the right side and get that experience as well as training
2071253 chandra has two full seasons behind her and marina one
2071254 now theyre juniors so im looking for even more offensive play by using different shots thats whats going to take to get us to the next level we need them to do different things for us to move up in the standings theyre really going to have to step up we need to see them become consistent especially against the top teams in the league
2071255 kelsie does a great job with ball control shes a great passer and defensively has done well
2071256 jen a member of the missouri valley conference all freshman team a year ago puts the whole package together shes a complete player while sydney can come in and get a kill and i used her a lot in that position that last year at one point i think with some more maturity jumping wise she could be at the top of that group she has already made great improvements in the weight room
2071257 were going to make sure we keep her on the court it will just be imperative to keep her injury free her back is doing well right now but our goal with her one season left is to just keep her on the court shell be an all conference performer if that happens for us last year she was third in points until she got sick so in my mind she will be a top performer in the conference as long as she stays healthy
2071258 amanda brings a lot of maturity to the right side
2071259 shes a good blocker shes played with a high level club and won a state championship with her high school

2071276 at a time when workers retirement benefits are increasingly in jeopardy and executive compensation continues to rise too often without relation to company performance these revelations are particularly disturbing

2071287 to be able to bring a house of speed franchise to the northern virginia area is an absolute joy and blessing
2071288 our partnership with the sports network and fitness and hoop magic is just another chance to influence young people in a positive way
2071289 bringing this program to northern virginia is a tremendous opportunity this program offers not only expertise in speed training and overall physical skill development but its what we do in building character with young athletes that sets us apart
2071290 our reputation has reached the highest levels of sports and we continue to strive for new heights with our state of the art training programs we look forward to being in green bay to enhance performance and abilities in all sports by developing character and sportsmanship we are giving the keys to athletic success in achieving this we can help place athletes one step ahead of the majority of competitors they face the speed and athletic performance we teach will only widen the gap

2071324 with the downturn and the equities market in general its not a surprise someone would take interest in the stock
2071325 companies usually go private when their stock is trading at a perceived discount to the underlying value or when there is more value potential for the company as a private entity
2071326 they will obviously review the offer and the consequences of being under private ownership but they may also entertain bids from other entities sell assets or simply decide that going private is not in the best long term interest of the company despite the premium to current stock price

2071352 patrick just said he wouldnt leave but you cant take those types of denials as a dead certainty
2071353 its hard to turn down a new president of the united states if the request came i think he would have to look at it seriously
2071354 hes coming off his best time in office with legislative achievements in clean energy and life sciences
2071355 so right now it is looking like if he wants to stay he can make something of it here hes stabilized enough now with some achievements hes shown some strength
2071356 what kind of job would be lofty enough for the governor of an important state to want to leave

2071358 the more likely scenario for deval patrick is a run for the u s senate
2071359 that way he gets to stand in his own shoes on the national stage if obama falls short patrick could then be the beneficiary of a ready made national campaign

2071654 somos conscientes de que se nos escap una oportunidad muy buena est bamos convencidos de que con el equipo que ten amos no nos tendr a que haber pasado

2071659 no est garantizada la continuidad de los programes d ensenyament en valenci pev en el tr nsito de los colegios de primaria a secundaria
2071660 de la misma manera y esto es mucho m s grave por ser reiterado tampoco hay continuidad entre el pev en eso y en bachillerato en un mismo instituto
2071661 muchos estudiantes que vienen haciendo los estudios en pev desde primaria cambian de modalidad ling stica al entrar al bachillerato porque los centros no pueden ofrecer todas las modalidades dobladas
2071662 este es uno de los efectos colaterales provocados por la concertaci n del bachillerato con los centros privados concertados y es que cuando el n mero de unidades de bachillerato se mantiene pero hay que repartir entre m s los centros p blicos salen a menos grupos y si hay que reducir se suele romper por el eslab n m s d bil es decir los programas d ensenyament en valenci
2071663 mucha preocupaci n entre numerosos directores de centros el profesorado en el sentido de que existe mucha precipitaci n e improvisaci n en los finales y principios de curso que imposibilitan planificar el curso siguiente con un m nimo de rigor
2071664 se complica este a o con la persistencia del consell en mantener su batalla con la asignatura de ecuaci n por la ciudadan a
2071665 los ejemplos de esta improvisaci n y las ocurrencias que es el nico lenguaje que entiende el se or font de mora se concreta por ejemplo en el hecho de que la orden que regula la organizaci n de la formaci n profesional a distancia firmada el 4 de julio se public en el docv el 31 de julio cuando ya no queda nadie en los centros y cuando adem s ya se acab el plazo para pedir plaza
2071666 los mismos directores de centros se sorprenden de que en el docv del 16 de julio se publique la resoluci n que autorizaba a centros docentes a impartir programas de cualificaci n profesional inicial es decir programas especiales para alumnos de la e s o con serio riesgo de abandono del sistema educativo y se da de plazo para solicitar plaza en estos programas del 11 al 17 de julio
2071667 los centros sab an verbalmente si les hab an autorizado o no los programas solicitados pero los alumnos no por lo que desconoc an en qu centro hac an el programa que les pudiera interesar
2071668 la conclusi n es que muchos estudiantes se han quedado sin plaza y eso es muy grave porque estamos hablando de j venes que est n en al borde justo del sistema
2071669 otras muestras de esta improvisaci n malintencionada es que el 23 de julio se public la resoluci n que ordena el bachillerato cuando ya no se pod an hacer claustros de profesores o que la orden de inicio de curso se publicara en docv el 22 de julio

2071671 i think that under the glare of the olympic spotlight we can see areas where china has taken small steps forward particularly in relation to their commitment on media freedom
2071672 i think that the important thing now is not just that things get smartened up and more acceptable for the olympics but this is an opportunity for china to say to the rest of the world we were privileged by having the olympics and we as a country are going to begin change that will last well beyond the olympics
2071673 this is why i think international dialogue has got to continue after the olympics perhaps the intensity of concern about issues in relation to tibet human rights in china media freedom particularly media freedom for chinese journalists not just western journalists is something it is important we all continue to pursue in dialogue with the chinese government

2071748 sleep appears to restore our emotional brain circuits and in doing so prepares us for the next days challenges and social interactions most importantly this study demonstrates the dangers of not sleeping enough sleep deprivation fractures the brain mechanisms that regulate key aspects of our mental health the bottom line is that sleep is not a luxury that we can optionally choose to take whenever we like it is a biological necessity and without it there is only so far the band will stretch before it snaps with both cognitive and emotional consequences
2071749 we had predicted a potential increase in the emotional reaction from the brain in people deprived of sleep but the size of the increase truly surprised us
2071750 the emotional centers of the brain were over 60 more reactive under conditions of sleep deprivation than in subjects who had obtained a normal night of sleep
2071751 clinical evidence has shown that some form of sleep disruption is present in almost all psychiatric disorders these findings may offer new mechanisms as to why and provide novel insights into how we can understand and even treat these disorders at a brain level

2071833 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
2071834 we adore him as the baby in the manager we rejoice over the empty tomb but aside from these two seasons our attention is primarily focused on us on our performance on our spiritual growth we know that the incarnation and resurrection are important truths to our initial salvation but thats pretty much where the impact ends
2071835 if you neglect to focus on gods love for you in christ your christianity will soon be reduced to a program of self improvement just one of many methods to help you
2071836 and although that might seem like a worthy goal it isnt true christianity at all true christianity is not a program of self improvement its an acknowledgment that something more than self improvement is needed

2071838 this seems like a perfect combination of hulk meets conan the barbarian i think this book is in great hands paks and i look forward to see where he goes with it i think this book will have big characters and big fights
2071839 skaar son of hulk is an interesting beast of a comic i just want to recommend trying it and letting it breath and grow its sort of a barbarian story machine the art works it creates a very raw look that connects very effectively to the emotional core of the story

2071864 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
2071865 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2071866 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2071867 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2071868 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2071869 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2071870 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2071871 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2071872 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2071873 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2071874 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2071875 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2071876 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2071877 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2071878 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2071879 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2071880 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2071881 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2071882 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2071883 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2071884 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2071885 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2071886 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2071887 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2071888 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2071889 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2071890 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2071891 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2071892 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2071893 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2071894 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2071895 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2071896 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2071897 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
2071898 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
2071899 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america

2071903 in 2006 40 4 percent an estimated 71 5 million persons of u s adults aged 18 to 64 years reported ever being tested for hiv infection
2071904 in addition 10 4 percent an estimated 17 8 million persons reported being tested in the preceding 12 months and 23 percent of persons who acknowledged having hiv risk factors reported being tested in the preceding 12 months
2071905 the data in this report suggest that progress in hiv testing stalled in the mid to late 1990s and new strategies such as expanded screening in health care settings appear to be warranted
2071906 early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection enables infected persons to obtain medical care that can improve the quality and length of their lives and adopt behaviors to prevent further hiv transmission

2071948 it wasnt anything that anybody thought anything about there were no big stars back then everyone at sun got started together sam phillips was smart enough to leave all the guys alone and thats what made it happen

2072041 it was nice to stay ahead and not give them any life theyre got some pretty good sticks we didnt give them any hits or any momentum
2072042 the guys got on the bats early and i thought that was key
2072043 the last few nights weve been coming through with the bats in the sixth or seventh tonight we came through early
2072044 we had the first at bats and we got it going to start and tried to keep it going
2072045 we got some runs and got a little confidence and maybe they had a little less confidence because we got ahead on them
2072046 game 2 they came back game 3 they came back it was our turn and it just didnt happen today they hit the ball four home runs was the story

2072050 le nostre montagne tra paesaggio culturale e naturale evoluzione visioni scelte
2072051 the tunnel built in the 1930s is a 20 foot wide rectangular concrete conduit that ranges between 11 and 18 feet tall
2072052 the rio grande forms the longest section of the border between the two countries but what happens to that border when the river itself changes course
2072053 to try to prevent the rio grande from changing course and causing more border disputes the mexican and american governments have spent millions on course corrections and flood control programs including the construction of canals dams and levees
2072054 occupies territory that used to be part of texas but for the last 15 years the town and the land have belonged to mexico even though most of the fewer than 1 000 residents who were born here claim american citizenship
2072055 the fence will affect 21 wildlife management areas and refuges in the rio grande valley short and long term negligible to moderate adverse impacts on wildlife and aquatic resources will be expected
2072056 the system is designed to handle the rain that accompanied deadly hurricane beulah in 1967 but that there are portions of the levee that could overtop with storms of a lesser magnitude portions of the levees in hidalgo county are between 3 to 9 feet below the height they should be according to ibwc
2072057 that the red cross wouldnt set up shelters in the rio grande valley until after the hurricane had passed
2072058 have any hydrological studies been conducted to assess the potential impact of proposed border fence on the stability of the flood control levee systems in both southern texas and northeastern mexico and what is the probable impact on the rio grande valley region if the levee systems in either texas or mexico should fail if hydrological studies have indeed been conducted who were the researchers what are their credentials and what was the type and quality of the data used to reach the conclusions reported in the eis if any legitimate hydrological studies relating to this topic actually exist their methodologies data and results should be discussed in open forum so that the people who live here can judge for themselves whether or not conclusions reported in the eis are valid
2072059 that plan significantly cut back the amount of private land that would have to be used for the project in hidalgo county by building a concrete wall into the riverside of the existing levees that way the county would get its needed flood protection and homeland security would meet congress mandate to build a barrier along 670 miles of the u s mexico border san benito texas based ballenger construction co won the 21 4 million contract to build the 1 76 mile granjeno segment pasadena texas based ser construction partners won the 12 million contract for the donna segment which is just under a mile long
2072060 this only makes sense if you work for the department of homeland security the same government agency that failed the people of mississippi and louisiana during hurricane katrina
2072061 they designed a wall that will cost american taxpayers 16 million per mile to build in some sections 50 billion over the years
2072062 the only places where they are paying to rebuild the levees are in areas where border patrol identified a need for a wall
2072063 the government is paying to repair the levees in bits and pieces
2072064 emergency or law enforcement personnel wont be able to rescue people or property when fire flood or crime requires help
2072065 wildlife wont be able to access the life giving resources of the rio grande river people and wildlife in many cases endangered species will die congress and president bush should grant them relief and stop building an absurd border wall that endangers lives
2072066 at another segment about eight miles east of the santa ana national wildlife refuge at least one crane had started peeling away grass from the side of the levee pasadena based ser construction partners ltd won the contract for the 0 9 mile segment
2072067 since the congressional research office estimated 49 billion for 700 miles of border fence then its reasonable to expect that movable fencing will cost taxpayers even more plus the government will need to pay someone to move the fencing when disaster looms sounds like whoever gets the contract will also deserve hazard pay add that to the nations already bloated border security costs cant wait to see which private company gets the fat contract to move the fence before major flooding events

2072074 deaths and injuries have been reported including among russian peacekeepers its all very sad and alarming and of course there will be a response
2072075 russian georgian relations have deteriorated to the point that some kremlin officials are seriously weighing a military operation which they hope will hand georgia a military defeat and topple president saakashivili
2072076 its springtime a time to start a war with georgia
2072077 saakashvili is out of control and needs to be brought to heel
2072078 if georgians keep quiet and behave we may even tolerate their joining nato but if they are loud well take measures
2072079 if iran strikes first or if israel must launch a pre emptive strike against iran who would you rather have as commander in chief a diplomat like tzipi livni or a military man like me
2072080 his political zigzagging was evident when he joined kadima a mere 48 hours after announcing to the world that the likud was his political home forever and ever or when he fiercely objected to the construction of the security fence only to take charge of the operation or when it came time to vote on the gaza pullout where he turned from one of the moves most adamant opponents to one of its most enthused advocates almost overnight

2072124 we have argued that the central public policy goal for environmental groups is at odds with the needs of individuals and communities environmental groups today seek the preservation of natural resources from human use over their protection for human use
2072125 last october 13 president clinton directed the forest service to prepare a study that would ban road building on parts of the national forest system that are currently roadless but that congress has not agreed to designate as permanent wilderness areas
2072126 to complete a public education effort for permanent administrative protection of the largest remaining tracts of pristine old growth remaining in u s national forests
2072127 the trend from 1865 to 1900 in which wealthy and powerful individuals companies and corporations sought either to force settlers off the land or to overcharge them for its occupancy in effect this was the land enclosing movement which in the west engendered instability and discontent comparable in england from the middle ages to the 18th century
2072128 environmentalism got its political start under the original liberal republican teddy roosevelt as no one who knows washington will be surprised to learn there were special interests at work when the federal government established the national parks system and locked up millions of acres it made other land held especially by the timber and railroad interests associated with j p morgan roosevelts mentor much more valuable some of these interests were the funders of the original conservation lobbying organization
2072129 why the disparity between actual conditions on public rangelands and the negative depictions in many government reports
2072130 in the 1980s environmentalists citing land degradation and lack of significant contribution to society launched a serious political campaign against livestock grazing on public lands which put it at the center of a major land use struggle this puts the future of rangeland grazing in question sadly their propaganda does not include many facts and is much at odds with documentation showing stable and improving range conditions
2072131 professional critics earn their living and boost their ego and political power based on a crisis they can walk into the halls of congress and be listened to even though reality is seldom discussed never mentioned is the fact that plants grow and produce tissue in excess of their own needs and this surplus organic material has to be periodically removed if it is not two things occur nutrients that need to go back into the soil are tied up in litter and accumulation and plants stagnate grass is not healthy and they cannot thrive
2072132 the benevolent grassroots movement that americans have been proud to serve for the good of man and nature is really little more than a front for market and stock manipulation and real estate transactions
2072133 some of the best known and most publicly supported environmental groups own huge stock portfolios and real estate holdings
2072134 these groups use their non profit status and reputations as selfless defenders of wildlife to buy and sell land at huge profits and control the legislative process that regulates competing companies and developers
2072135 there are more than 150 environmental groups with assets in excess of 5 million each
2072136 their total assets exceed 8 billion huge revenues like that dont come from 15 checks from concerned donors
2072137 this money comes from foundation grants government grants real estate holdings product marketing business deals and well managed stock portfolios

2072147 it is my strong opinion that sarah palins independence integrity and natural leadership style personify americas founding values
2072148 palins values now more than ever must have a strong presence in the office of the executive
2072149 i believe that governor sarah palins conservative credentials fight against corruption and stance on energy security along with her leadership experience as mayor of wasilla and governor of alaska make her the best qualified candidate for vice president of the united states
2072150 task force palin takes the short term vp effort and institutionalizes it as a more permanent presence
2072151 if palin becomes the vice presidential candidate then we will have some of the best coverage of the vp race on the internet if not we have an organization which can continue to promote palin as a national figure and should the worst occur a candidate to unseat barack obama in 2012 while its only in its embryonic stages right now were hoping to evolve tfp into a centralized headquarters that combines the functions of all of our sites into an online one stop shop for all things palin tfp will be bigger better and more professional than anything we ve done before

2072162 well i dont know if you can call how i was attacked a shark attack i mean first off sharks dont eat their own secondly sharks arent spineless unlike tycho and gabe
2072163 im trying to cue the viewer into hey were working with something different here im having a dialogue with the viewer
2072164 but i honestly dont know what the artist is trying to say
2072165 this is such a big thing for bristol youve got artists whose works are also on display in new york and in galleries and venues everywhere
2072166 i first got the idea when i was watching a television show about chinese writing
2072167 in china letters are called characters i thought the shapes were very beautiful
2072168 it sort of looks like a leg whatever it is its different

2072173 if you look at the significant sf books of the last several years there arent very many you could give to the uninitiated reader they all pretty much implicitly or explicitly assume youve been keeping up with the genre because the writers themselves have the sf literary community is like a boarding school were all up to our armpits in each others business literary and otherwise and then theres the sodomy but lets not go there
2072174 thanks to numerous horrifying lunchroom experiences growing up sf geeks are probably perfectly happy to be let alone with their genre and to let the mundanes read whatever appalling chick lit and or da vinci code clone theyre slobbering over this week now there would be a literary mashup for the ages the templars wore prada itd sell millions
2072175 john scalzi has styled this novel to stand well on its own the book starts with great humor that brings the reader into the story easily and comfortably you never get the feeling that your starting from the back of the series john gives you two pages of intro in john perrys universe and then blasts off

2072186 what was really astounding to us however was that when we fed normal mice a high fat diet we saw this same mechanism of pathogenesis with attenuation of gnt 4a enzyme levels reduced glut 2 glycosylation and loss of cell surface glut 2 expression
2072187 this finding may explain the loss of glut 2 commonly observed in type 2 diabetes for example transcriptional control of gnt 4a expression may underlie the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in human mature onset diabetes of the young mody and perhaps in response to leptin signaling deficiency in db mice
2072188 if you could somehow stimulate production of this enzyme you might be able to render animals and perhaps humans resistant to high fat diet induced diabetes
2072189 if our findings can be applied to humans they should give us important insights into how type 2 diabetes may be prevented and treated
2072190 it may be that suppressing insulin production to some degree could be beneficial in such disorders and that could theoretically be achieved by inhibiting the gnt 4a glycosyltransferase
2072191 researchers discover how a high fat diet causes type 2 diabetes
2072192 too much insulin can also be harmful and has been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer cardiovascular disease ovarian diseases and alzheimers disease
2072193 it may be that suppressing insulin production to some degree could be beneficial in such disorders
2072194 dont eat too much of that it is very rich
2072195 the number of women reporting that they receive less pay than their male counterparts has changed little over the last two years

2072607 isu adanya orang ketiga memang menyeruak seiring retaknya rumah tangga dewi lestari dan marcell siahaan saya sama sekali tidak ada hubungan spesial dengan pakar holistik yang anda sebutkan itu hubungan saya dan marcell dengan dia hanya sebagai teman bantah perempuan ini mengawali pembicaraannya dengan sejumlah wartawan termasuk edy suherli dari c amp r berikut petikannya c amp r benarkah karena kehadiran orang ketiga d tidak ada orang ketiga ataupun persoalan kdrt semua murni persoalan intern kami yang sudah tidak bisa disatukan lagi c amp r bukankah anda dekat dengan seorang pakar holistik yang bernama reza gunawan d kalau dengan dia saya hanya berteman biasa marcell juga berteman dengan dia jadi tidak ada hubungan yang spesial antara saya dengan dia
2072608 jadi ketidakcocokan marcell dan dewi lestari memang udah terjadi dari taun lalu
2072609 karma kali gara2 marcell keluar dari puppen dan malah jadi penyanyi pop pernah tuh puppen tahun 2002 apa 2003 gitu tampil di acara sma gw mereka bawain lagu baru yang ceritanya tentang pengkhianat band metal yang beralih jadi lagu cengeng marcell 2 mereka susah payah berjalan dengan idealisme mereka tau2 ada anggotanya yang keluar demi suatu yang mereka mati2an tolak tau nggak rasanya
2072610 katanya si marcell ketahuan yah lagi pegang2an ama salah satu finalis l men 2008 trus di sini dibilangnya dewi selingkuh jadinya dicerein nah karna itu mereka nggak mau ngasih tau apa penyebab perceraiannya 2 iya si marcell kan waktu itu dikabarin lagi deket sama salah satu pria l men dan lagi marcell sempet nyanyi pas di acara l men itu sendiri dia dikabarin lagi rangkul2an gt trus ketahuan ama temen deketnya si dewi alias managernya yah si dewi nggak terima dong suaminya lekong gitu jadi putus deeh 3 gue juga kaget waktu dengernya dewi aja nangis2 pas managernya ngomong gitu lagian banget managernya rada2 comel juga sih masa suaminya kaya gitu dilaporin ke dewi harusnya dilaporinnya ke publik
2072611 oh dulu yang katanya pasangan celebrities yang pindah agama dari kristen ke buddha itu ya apa mungkin mereka pindah ke buddha supaya cerainya gampang ya kirain dulu mereka pindah buddha karena ajarannya 2 menurut saya ya kalau seorang dewi lestari dan juga marcell jika ingin bercerai pindah agama dulu ke buddhist merupakan langkah yang tepat sebab kalau mereka tetap katholik perceraian mereka nggak bakal bisa dilaksanakan
2072612 inti dari tulisan si dewi tentang perceraiannya hubungan yang kadaluarsa ditulis dia sendiri pada paragraf ke 3 4 dan 5 bicara kadaluarsa seperti sebuah produk maka tanggal pacaran mereka adalah tanggal produksi dan tanggal pernikahan mereka adalah tanggal pergantian kemasan barang dan peningkatan kandungan ingredients dalam produk ada atau tidak ada kadaluarsa adalah pembicaraan yg mengarah sebuah penipuan penipuan atas kedok rasa bosan eksplorasi dan pencarian sensasi kalau mau lebih enak ya undang si dewi masuk milis ini
2072613 marcell mendirikan rumah tangga dengan dewi lestari pada 12 september 2003 dan mereka dikurniakan cahaya mata keenan avalokita kirana 3 tup tup baru baru ini ss dikhabarkan mereka sudah berpisah disebalik cerita mengejut itu ss tambah terkejut apabila dimaklumkan perceraian mereka angkara orang ketiga khabarnya wartawan indonesia sibuk mencari siapakah kekasih baru marcell hingga sanggup meninggalkan isterinya hebat sangatkah yang empunya diri sehingga berjaya merobohkan mahligai yang sudah bertahun dibina atas rasa cinta hasil siasatan wartawan indonesia itu lebih mengejutkan ss apabila dikatakan wanita yang bertanggungjawab menjadi punca keruntuhan rumah tangga marcell ialah artis tapi bukan senegara sebaliknya dari seberang tambak johor artis itu dikatakan cukup terkenal di negaranya dan difahamkan janda anak satu bagaimanapun ss kurang pasti sejauh mana hubungan marcell dengan artis itu sehingga kini wartawan indonesia belum tahu siapa artis wanita itu mungkin perkembangan artis di singapura tidak sehebat artis di malaysia tapi selepas ss selidik sendiri rupanya artis itu sedang berusaha membina nama di negara ini kalau tak salah ss drama lakonannya sedang ditayangkan
2072614 dee reza gunawan takashimaya singapore 30 july 2008 gw barusan 1 10 pm sin liat dewi lestari ama reza gunawan gandengan tangan di takashimaya b2 i took back what i said earlier bahwa gw ngga percaya reza gunawan jalan bareng dewi ternyata oh ternyata semuanya bull mau dewi dengan segala justifikasinya dan reza dengan klarifikasinya 2 gw dah mau foto tapi batere hp gw abis pas gw mau klik dia udah ngga bisa buat moto tapi gw ngga mungkin salah karena gw pernah contact dia beberapa waktu yang lalu bullsh1t semua coba deh baca blognya dewi di situ ada link ke blognya reza apa yang ditulis ngga sama dengan kenyataan gw liat dengan mata kepala gw sendiri mereka jalan berdua gandengan tangan terus makan vegetarian food masa iya kaya gitu cuman sahabat ke singapore bareng please deh

2072638 no es un sistema paralelo lo que hemos fortalecido son los saberes del pueblo en el cual el intercambio solidario forma parte de esos saberes

2072646 the way she looks at it he took long enough to finally admit what he did
2072647 as soon as it went to court he turned around and pleaded guilty the evidence they had against him was very good
2072648 if he had admitted his guilt it probably would not have got that far
2072649 but he made her suffer and dragged this out unnecessarily for the past year he should have admitted guilt in the first place

2072696 significant concern over the lack of financial protection for air travellers booked direct with scheduled airlines
2072697 all holidays carried atol protection 20 years ago now people put together holidays themselves and are without protection if one of the suppliers goes bust
2072698 it is not satisfactory for the government to allow a situation where people make different arrangements for the same holiday and it is pure chance whether they are protected
2072699 anyone who thinks airlines do not go bust is an idiot 27 carriers have gone bust already this year and there will be more major airlines do go bust

2072710 mukherjee beautifully weaves the ever morphing web of technology business and organizational learning together and explains why both top executives and middle managers must care about their impact
2072711 the business world is moving toward non hierarchical networks the answer to these changes is a combination of network management and collaborative leadership mukherjee goes beyond description of best practices the four design principles that he has developed to implement networks are conceptually well thought through and actionable this book deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in tomorrows organization
2072712 an adaptive organization must count as the response in the increasingly connected world in which business will operate in the decades ahead

2072751 the world has spent 50 billion on global warming since 1990 and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time that supports the idea that carbon emissions cause global warming computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence they are just theory

2072789 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2072790 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2072791 the bus drivers mean but he lets us have snacks on the bus but other than that hes mean
2072792 yeah well my bus driver turned your aunt and i in for starting an egg fight on the bus when we werent even on the bus that day

2072795 you have more flexibility in customizing the generated code outside of the tools data studio developer 1 2 exposes the eclipse jet templates used for generating all the sql create read update and delete crud operations the purequery database access layer and test code you can treat these templates as your own customize them and share them with all developers when your team uses data studio developer 1 2 the generated code now follows the changes from the customized templates you can use this functionality to create new files change existing generated files and more frameworks such as hibernate often make assumptions about mappings between the java objects and underlying relational data and do not provide control to the developer to change those mappings for example the framework might assume that any char 1 field should be mapped to a boolean data type if your business application actually stores several different status codes in that field that can mean the database will choose a suboptimal access path based on the assumption that it is looking for a boolean value data studio developer 1 2 now gives you the ability to specify default database to java type mappings at a workspace level you can customize these settings to match your development guidelines and business requirements you can then export these preferences and share with developers to ensure consistent usage of type mappings here are some additional features that can help with productivity and flexibility in large projects organize generated code for purequery interfaces and tests in different db2 sql packages format sql when code is generated or after sql is modified generate complete data access layers from one or more sql statements in one shot java database routine stored procedure development has never been easier simply point to your java method and click to deploy in addition you can now use purequery annotated method style static sql in your procedures and gain the same performance benefits as you have been getting from cobol using static sql but with the programming ease of purequery and java right click anywhere inside the java procedure and select the first release of data studio introduced a slick new solution for exposing database data as web services this solution aptly named data web services lets you create web services from database operations like sql statements select update insert delete xqueries and stored procedures without requiring any programming some of the salient features of data web services are a no coding approach to developing web services built in support for both soap and rest styled binding ability to deploy web services into an existing soa infrastructure with just a few clicks of the mouse auto generation of a wsdl file based on exposed web services integrated data access development and web services development environment with built in best practices data studio 1 2 further enhances data web services with a number of features that improve security manageability and provides a wider range of deployment options lets look at some of the key enhancements data studio developer now enables purequery use inside data web services the benefits of purequery like better performance security and manageability are now extended to data web services as well for j2ee web servers there is a new deploy option that allows you to specify whether the web service accesses the database using jdbc or purequery the package based authorization model of static sql enabled via purequery also gives the dba better control over what data is exposed via web services for provisioning web services that require guaranteed delivery you can use soap over jms instead of soap over http as shown in figure 18 you can now pick soap over jms as the underlying transport when you choose websphere application server as the target platform jms applications interact using either a point to point or a publish subscribe messaging model data web services in this release only support point to point messaging model using queues data web services developed using the no coding approach in data studio can be deployed into a reliable messaging environment by defining the necessary artifacts in websphere application server to enable jms data studio developer adds the websphere datapower soa appliance as a target platform for deploying web services datapower is a high performance purpose built and easy to deploy network device that simplifies helps secure and accelerates xml and web services see figure 19 you can now follow the same familiar development model as data studio 1 1 that is drag and drop web service assembly from database operations and choose to deploy the generated artifacts onto datapower instead of a j2ee server when deploying onto j2ee servers like websphere application server data studio developer generates a j2ee web application war file when you choose to deploy onto datapower data studio generates xslt files instead of a war file that can be deployed onto datapower this solution combines the best of both worlds the simplified development model of data web services with the wire speed processing of datapower for high throughput of web services weve only scratched the surface of the key new features in data studio developer 1 2 the best way to really get a feel for the enhancements described here is to download the trial version and play with it yourself we also recommend that you take a look at a video one of our engineers put together that reviews many of the key features described here table 1 summarizes the version 2 1 feature support per database platform db2 for luw informix dynamic server n a yes yes problem determination for developers impact analysis for database applications yes yes yes no yes yes web services based access to db2 using websphere datapower soa appliances special thanks to kathryn zeidenstein for her contributions to this article ibm

2072896 we are proud to hold the olympics and we are looking forward to them but we do not feel we have to please anyone or explain ourselves we have our own business like the rest of the world and will do it
2072897 maybe the world has a quaint picture of the old china but we want progress hu tongs might look nice on a picture but they are not nice to live in they are hovels we want better houses better buildings and a better future and this has nothing to do with the olympics
2072898 what people dont seem to understand is that so much of what they see out there really hasnt got that much to do with the olympics
2072899 the olympics merely provided an immutable deadline for some of the infrastructure that was needed to keep pace with other developments it has to be remembered that no country in history has ever undergone the changes that this one is now dealing with
2072900 in the next 20 years between 200 and 300 million chinese will move from the countryside to cities many of them newly developed there was never for a second a question that china would take on the olympics without being sure of what they were doing the olympics may be costing around 20bn but it is just a fraction of the cost of what is happening around the city and the country
2072901 the chinese are looking for world class models for the urbanisation which is going to be vast in the next few years
2072902 for most chinese tibet is simply a non issue maybe down the line there will be a settlement something like home rule but even the tibetans i gather from journalist friends who went up there are saying look clear out well deal with it ourselves
2072903 the chinese are now obsessed with the future and they do realise they have some massive issues like the movement of population the environment economic development there is so much to do they feel that if you mention tibet it is almost like asking them where they are going to put the sofa
2072904 i can see a lot of old china disappearing and i dont really want to see that so many people were moved to make way for the olympics and the old hu tongs are in danger of disappearing
2072905 perhaps a million people have moved in recent years but only a fraction was a result of the olympics
2072906 obviously you do not want to see a culture disappear and i would be very disappointed if that happened
2072907 i believe the chinese have been very clever they know the value of psychology and there is no doubt that the olympics can be important in how a lot of the people here think of themselves
2072908 when i look at it i believe it is facing the future of china not its past
2072909 in the nineties we were all a little in awe of the japanese and a lot of people wanted to copy them well i have to say that in engineering the chinese are better able to absorb the demands of advanced work
2072910 in fact i think in the near future in places like london there are going to be a lot of signs saying things like national engineering company of china

2072960 recent documents indicate that newry amp mourne ambulance service will lose 3 shifts a week this is a detriment step for the service in the area i and other sinn f in representatives have met with the chief executive of the nias on several occasions and he has recognised and agreed that the ambulance service here was already stretched and required greater financial assistance this is a further blow to this already stretched amenity
2072961 i have been involved with sinn f in in south armagh in a campaign to acquire a rapid response vehicle rrv for the area during this campaign we gathered over 7000 signatures from people demanding that the area be given greater medical emergency services although we welcomed the news that an rrv has been introduced to newry it is disappointing that the loss of three ambulance shifts a week has been announced
2072962 furthermore the exact location of the rrv remains a mystery and has been seen in areas far from south armagh such as kilkeel i maintain that this service must provide essential service to south armagh as it is the least covered area in the district

2073193 we have two race engines and we should possibly expand that everyone has been able to cope with it
2073194 obviously formula one needs the smaller teams in it at the moment it is incredibly competitive and were regularly qualifying well under two seconds off the quickest lap time and we do that off 120 million

2073203 aint nothin like me not once not twice but several times according to joe he knows exactly why he believes his rival labelmate r kelly would call jive executives and radio stations urging them not to promote his music too strongly
2073204 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall sic need to pull that back and they would oblige its incredible that now i get the opportunity to i dont know maybe pay r kelly back in some sort of side bar kind of thing
2073205 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations he felt like they should pull back because he felt he was more important and with their loyalty to him they obliged

2073244 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
2073245 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february
2073246 given the 2 6 year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
2073247 the growth of the online fashion industry has been one of the main contributors to the increasing market share of high street retailers online
2073248 however there are exceptions to the rule asos was the second most visited website in our shopping and classifieds apparel and accessories category in july 2008 uk internet traffic to online only fashion retailers has more than doubled over the last 12 months

2073360 esiste una complementariet tra linsegnamento sulla creazione e quello sulla redenzione
2073361 lei pu rispondere molto meglio di me a questa domanda
2073362 ci sono stati tempi ha ammesso benedetto xvi in cui abbiamo lasciato in ombra linsegnamento sul dio creatore mentre dobbiamo collegarlo meglio con quello sulla salvezza
2073363 se viene negato dio si entra in un mondo che si riduce alla materia allora viene a mancare anche il fondamento per costruire una responsabilit delluomo di fronte a dio alla creazione e al suo uso nel mondo chiuso nel materialismo larbitrio delluomo sulle creature pi ampio
2073364 a tutte queste domande dobbiamo cercare insieme nel dialogo le soluzioni nella chiesa ha detto il papa ci sono i vescovi i sinodi dei vescovi ed un processo di ricerca continua il trovare una risposta a questi quesiti

2073389 for me the most interesting part of debates is the q amp a because then you get to hear what some of the audience is thinking again and again the question of morality came up i was asked that since i dont believe in god if i think it was perfectly acceptable what hitler did to the jews incredible
2073390 why do we consider and refer to his actions as immoral
2073391 that really is one of their favorite arguments but i deflated the morality proof once and for all with a no win question i posed first to the individual then to geivett then to the whole audience if there is no god what would you do morally would you kill me
2073392 the first guy said that if he found out there is not god he was not sure whether he would kill me or not i said well that tells us a lot about the depth of your character stay far far away from me geivett said that was an unfair question but that he too was not sure if he could be moral without god
2073393 i repeated my admonition that one would be well advised to steer clear of people who have so little character that without the threat of eternal punishment they have no self control i then addressed the entire audience and said if you cannot be moral without god doesnt that imply that in reality you are not a moral person at all that you have no courage no conscious and no character and if you would be moral without god doesnt that refute the argument that you cannot be moral without god think about this who would you rather marry a person who says i will not cheat on you because it is a sin and i dont want to go to hell or someone who says i will not cheat on you because i love you i respect you i promised that i would not do so and i have the courage and character to live up to my promises i think i hope the point was made

2073395 in nature the usual selecting agent is direct stark and simple it is the grim reaper
2073396 a person who says i will not cheat on you because it is a sin and i dont want to go to hell or someone who says i will not cheat on you because i love you
2073397 i want to live this time now and do the best i can ah with with what ive been given
2073398 christians too that are trying hard to change the world today trying to make advancements in science and and
2073399 for the love of people for the love of god i suppose
2073400 oh for the love of god yes so we got the old fear thing again if you dont do this boy youre gonna go to hell and you know what hell is like ooh thats very hot very nasty its almost like florida in the summer
2073401 i can show that from a darwinian point of view there is more darwinian advantage to a male in being promiscuous and a female being faithful without saying that i therefore think human males are justified in being promiscuous and cheating on their wives there is no logical connection between what is and what ought
2073402 we are machines built by dna whose purpose is to make more copies of the same dna it is every living objects sole reason for living
2073403 if god told you to kill me would you do it
2073404 payne replied uncomfortably that if he were certain it was really god making the command he would have to consider it
2073405 but i deflated the morality proof once and for all with a no win question i posed first to the individual then to geivett then to the whole audience if there is no god what would you do morally would you kill me
2073406 their existence is the best explanation for our intuitive judgments and the supposition that they dont exist leads to absurdity
2073407 when are you planning to ask substantive questions instead of irrelevant ones
2073408 i thought i was lucky to have been chosen to sleep with this man i was a vulnerable young boy with no knowledge of the world that existed outside jari
2073409 i trusted white men who had on the surface appeared to make jari a good place to live
2073410 upon the facts of reality more specifically it is based on a logical integration of all relevant facts
2073411 if i say that ice cream is cold this is an objective fact its outside my mind and yours its external and verifiable
2073412 why is it good to reduce the amount of humans that die
2073413 the ice cream molecules are moving with this much energy
2073414 x amount of people are dying as a result of this action
2073415 hello question id like to introduce you to beg you get along quite fine dont you
2073416 an example of a moral absolute it is wrong to torture innocent people for fun
2073417 the argument is that you claim there are moral absolutes but when you try state what just one of them is you are caught up in subjectivism and relativism consequently your criticism of non theist morality as failing because it is subjective and relativist is empty
2073418 if there is no god what would you do morally
2073419 actually science never will be able to quantify moral truths it isnt designed to explain certain concepts like morality it tells us how the universe is not how it ought to be
2073420 only falsifiable theories are considered scientifically meaningful for all your predisposition to the metaphysical and transcendental such beliefs are meaningless unless you have a method for establishing knowledge from a set of beliefs
2073421 if god really is good then perhaps he intervened so that the event wouldnt have been traumatizing for the kid or perhaps abraham not wanting to frighten the child did it in such a manner so that his son wouldnt be worried by it
2073422 the logical outcome however is that if god is good by nature then nothing he did during the event would have been evil even if it might have been
2073423 regardless that really doesnt have anything to do with the overall argument sfar as i can see
2073424 in this scene god shows the father of faith what would be required to atone for our sin thus showing how awful our sin really is
2073425 gen 22 9 on the other hand has him binding isaac which would be unnecessary if isaac was willing after he found out that he was to be the sacrificial lamb
2073426 god told abraham to do it maybe he told andrea yates
2073427 i dont believe god audibly speaks like that anymore i also dont believe god would have someone do something evil and even when he asked abraham to do something puzzling at the time it was
2073428 i dont believe god audibly speaks like that anymore i also dont believe god would have someone do something evil and even when he asked abraham to do something puzzling at the time it was relevant to redemptive history
2073429 now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man only the young girls who are virgins may live you may keep them for yourselves
2073430 something is true only if it is verifiable by science otherwise even if its true it may as well be false
2073431 why dont you humor me with your interpretation maybe i can clear up the misunderstanding in your mind
2073432 exactly which scientific studies did you read that left you with such a crippled understanding of the research id like to read them thanks
2073433 the joy that abraham must have felt would be greater since his valley was deeper
2073434 had he not been asked that joy of experiencing gods release would have never been experienced
2073435 thank god that god didnt let me go through with the thing that god told me to do
2073436 as for issac the text itself doesnt give you a struggling boy nor does it give you a screaming boy it is implicit that issac was faithful and trusting
2073437 in fact your claim is completely refuted by the fact that issac grew later to love god
2073438 nice bait and switch i said god was good not abraham
2073439 a third approach can be seen in the interpretation of r
2073440 and shall be offered by me as a burnt offering
2073441 11 30 and jephthah voweth a vow to jehovah and saith if thou dost at all give the bene ammon into my hand
2073442 the methods of the natural sciences should be applied to any subject matter
2073443 when it comes to facts and explaining facts science is the only game in town
2073444 gen 22 9 on the other hand has him binding isaac which would be unnecessary if isaac was willing after he found out that he was to be the sacrificial lamb
2073445 abraham was an old man and while isaac was apparently not an adult he was not a weak little child it was after all isaac who carried the wood
2073446 old by our standards yes but this is back when according to the ot people still lived too long not the 900 years of the earliest people
2073447 i dont see how you get to willingly submitted from his being able to carry the wood
2073448 gen 22 5 indicates one of two possibilities either abraham believed that isaac would come back with him either by god changing his mind at some point or by resurrection or he lied to the servants that travelled with him up to that point to allay suspicion most likely
2073449 i blame irishfarmer who threw me off by using the word to construct a double negative
2073450 then give me an example of this a rational way of attaining a non scientific truth and if possible pick an example that could be relevant to the current discussion by giving this example you will also be explaining to me what you mean by a non scientific truth and how you know that it is true
2073451 isaac despite that he was apparently not an adult was not a little child
2073452 then when abraham could no longer not tell isaac what was going on so far as abraham knew isaac willingly submitted to being bound upon the altar
2073453 he was not a child at the mercy of an adult he could have fought against the entire thing he could have run away he did not he willingly submitted
2073454 and you people never seem to question the assumptions you bring to these objections
2073455 god did not tell us to sacrifice animals that was our idea cains in fact and had cain not then murdered abel all of history would have been different
2073456 sorry but a divine command by god to kill in the ot is not murder just as much as you killing under the law of our society for war isnt considered murder
2073457 gods intention was to teach a greater truth about the sacrifice of the most innocent person to have ever lived his own son
2073458 there is nothing in that incident that shook issac he followed god till the end
2073459 okay first things first look what happened when israel choose not to follow what god said they ended up sacrificing their children to devils
2073460 secondly there is not a single passage in scripture where god visits judgment on totally innocent people the people are not innocent
2073461 gods intention was to teach a greater truth about the sacrifice of the most innocent person to have ever lived his own son
2073462 in your 9 11 analogy hes not involve in planning the act training the terrorists or flying the plane hes an unrelated innocent third party
2073463 you are working at a circus and a group of 42 15 year old boys are making fun of your suit if you pray to god and he tells you to release the lock on the bear cage you do so and the bear kills all 42 lads is this wrong objectively
2073464 if i was the pilot of a plane in a position to shoot down another plane and i was ordered to do so by a competent authority my actions would be moral regardless of who was on the plane
2073465 you have morally sufficient reason to kill then you have no case against god
2073466 with the plane you have morally sufficient reasons to shoot it down for the greater good
2073467 god has morally sufficient reasons to allow what has happened to kill to do whatever he pleases
2073468 perhaps you might want to re read the passage issac didnt die
2073469 in this case you have no case then against the morally sufficient reasons for what god does
2073470 also using your logic then every single parent should be held accountable since they willing bring in children into the world knowing that they will have the
2073471 and to take it even further men who get their wives pregnant are guilty of direct involvement in the tremendous
2073472 since they cant ask the baby if they want the
2073473 its up to us to react to that grace because none of us deserve it
2073474 well then the proper thing to do would be to maximize the destruction by letting the plane crash into the tower no maybe even help out a little by strafing the streets as the little sinners try to flee
2073475 the proper thing is to save who deserves to be saved
2073476 the lord brings death and makes alive he brings down to the grave and raises up
2073477 using that logic all parents then are guilty of putting a
2073478 the lord brings death and makes alive he brings down to the grave and raises up
2073479 i know i certainly would feel different being killed by someone who could bring me back
2073480 you started talking about issac being traumatized or unfairly put through something
2073481 well son today im going to tie you up and stab you
2073482 using that logic then every single parent is guilty of inflicting trauma upon their child since they full well know that life begins in a shock and a cry and ends in sorrow and death
2073483 or gt gt gt gt are you willing to admit that
2073484 you should be campaigning for the end of humanity since the very existence and birth of this thing called
2073485 are you now saying that as long as it is natural you can enjoy yourself and not worry about causing trauma on children
2073486 cant believe you just said that just let the planet go then
2073487 the methods of the natural sciences should be applied to any subject matter
2073488 when it comes to facts and explaining facts science is the only game in town
2073489 so weve established that it is ok to torture and kill children under certain circumstances
2073490 first of all this is centered around moral justification and god having it in regards to his dealings and so forth
2073491 isaac despite that he was apparently not an adult was not a little child
2073492 gen 22 9 on the other hand has him binding isaac which would be unnecessary if isaac was willing after he found out that he was to be the sacrificial lamb
2073493 my posts to you have addressed specifically the faulty thinking expressed in that and now rather than just admit the faulty nature of that particular objection you try to pretend this was about something else
2073494 then when abraham could no longer not tell isaac what was going on so far as abraham knew isaac willingly submitted to being bound upon the altar
2073495 god did not tell us to sacrifice animals that was our idea cains in fact
2073496 cain murdering his brother because he was jealous that god prefers a protein rich offering rather than one thats high in fibre is a sacrifice
2073497 from time to time the daughters of israel go to talk to the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year
2073498 that his daughter wept for her virginity indicated more than her never marrying
2073499 11 30 and jephthah voweth a vow to jehovah and saith if thou dost at all give the bene ammon into my hand
2073500 isaac despite that he was apparently not an adult was not a little child
2073501 what is it with you people not only are you plural as a generality intellectually dishonest youre also without shame and or self respect
2073502 my posts to you have addressed specifically the faulty thinking expressed in that
2073503 then when abraham could no longer not tell isaac what was going on so far as abraham knew isaac willingly submitted to being bound upon the altar
2073504 and as seems always to be the modus operandi of internet atheists who seem almost without exception merely to be the old fashioned and long familiar village atheist with an ethernet port youre now attempting misdirection and distraction
2073505 but since you ask let me ask you how do you a mere atheist after all have any grounds to question whether anything is right how precisely do you determine whether anything is right or wrong
2073506 do the terms right and wrong even have meaning were atheism actually the truth about the nature of reality
2073507 it had nothing to do with protein it wasnt due to the content of the offerings that god accepted the one and not the other it had to do with attitude cains attidude was mercenary abels attitude was worshipful
2073508 i disagree god is the ground of goodness truth and justice he is the creator we are the created big difference any moral reason we have must be founded upon his character
2073509 as humans we dont always know who is deserving of death also just because you deserve death it doesnt follow that grace cant be given you
2073510 no because grace can be given out of mercy you left mercy at the door
2073511 but what about people who dont deserve to die there is moral justification in killing them if it serves or protects the greater good
2073512 can you tell me what is human value based on in your view what is it that makes a human valuable
2073513 excuse me wtf are you some sort of formal logic syntax checker
2073514 but i find it challenging and fulfilling to reject eternity and the transcendent
2073515 there might be some truths about these things but we have no way of knowing about them because were limited to science
2073516 now do you have any observed examples of evolution i would like to get some
2073517 one that was really spectacular just recently is the observation of divergence of species of lizards in the mediterranean there were a set of islands there that were kind of abandoned by a war on the slavics on the balkan peninsula what happened was that while they were abandoned there were these introduced species of lizards that were rapidly evolving to take advantage of new situations so they were switching from a mostly insect lifestyle where they were eating lots of insects to one where they were also taking advantage of plant material not only have they observed changes they can document them they can see the species shift but they have also discovered that these lizards have evolved a new structure a new little enfolding of the gut to allow them to digest more food plant material in particular so you know its a combination of things its actually observing a change in populations and its the observing the appearance of novel structures in the gut
2073518 in the end the pogos appeal lies in its mobility and its near instantaneous picture production teens and tweens in particular will love this feature and casual users and business folks for example real estate agents who want to print pics of specific rooms for clients without delay may appreciate pogos portability
2073519 t he pictures are dry as soon as they develop and you never replace
2073520 the print quality isnt the sharpest weve seen but for pure convenience and dare we say it fun its great value even the paper is a lot cheaper than traditional instant film
2073521 i was disappointed that it does not work with all bluetooth phones jon pollock a polaroid spokesman said the pogo is compatible with about 80 percent of the bluetooth phones sold during the past two years i tested it with 11 phones and was able to print from only five of them one phone thats noticeably absent from the list of compatible phones on polaroids web site is the apple iphone
2073522 the heat sensitive paper is well rather sensitive after my colleague printed out a pic of a ferrari he instinctively started shaking it to make it develop although the image was fully baked the tight grip of his thumb and forefinger on the thermal paper actually discolored it slightly word to the wise if you scoop up a pogo keep your shots away from moderate heat
2073523 battery life could be longer print quality could be much better but if you need something like this theres nothing else like it
2073524 think of this as really the new polaroid print unexpected saturated colors with imperfect photos in general id say its imperfections in terms of image quality is aesthetically cool
2073525 the pogo prints arent going to compete with specialist photographic services or even the larger inkjet photo printers that you can buy these days but you have to remember this is a printer that fits in your pocket when you consider that you can produce prints practically anywhere and any time then you begin to see where this little gadget will find its market
2073526 lets not dwell on the past lets work towards a better future
2073527 any time people are using their time and resources to make things its a gain on that consumer culture mentality
2073528 do what you can with what you have where you are
2073529 we are a nation of consumers but thats not a bad thing
2073530 to the former policy wonk who despite shedding the previous mr logic image is still best known as an intellectual
2073531 i think his argument that there is a fusion tradition a liberal tradition that is concerned with social justice is right and i admire his work on capabilities and on freedom as capability
2073532 min p stand er dermed at kvinner utsettes for kontinuerlig partnervold fordi de er fysisk svakere enn menn alts fordi at voldelige menn som har en partner ogs bruker vold mot denne som ikke t r stikke av og ikke klarer ta igjen dette vil ikke endre seg om vi f r et likestilt samfunn

2073549 the referees will not be available to accept appointments in the premier league or the championship with immediate effect
2073550 we are disappointed that we have had to make this call we have given the irish football association ample opportunity tonight there was a meeting that could have solved the problem and they chose to stick to their guns they will have to clarify their thinking and explain why they have brought us to this position
2073551 the issue of pay can be solved the problem here is the attitude that the championship is a league that can be officiated on its own
2073552 the senior referees are saying they are struggling to control these games
2073553 there have only been two rounds of them and so far weve had something like 12 red cards the matches are being played in front of big crowds the referees are coming under great scrutiny the tackles are flying in people are being hit

2073577 what borrowers need to know about credit scoring models and credit scores
2073578 after consulting with the federal reserve board and the federal trade commission earlier this year fair isaac has decided to include consideration of authorized user trade lines present on the credit report
2073579 this was nothing more than good old fashioned smoke and mirrors politics
2073580 since there was nothing the fair isaac corp could legally do about it they sent out press releases saying the complete opposite and ill informed reporters at nearly every major media outlet believed them the story was splashed all over newspapers web sites and tv stations without ever stopping to ask legal counsel whether or not fico could actually get away with such an atrocity when the general public saw these stories on msn com nbc and in the new york times they just believed them to be true

2073591 shame on lor al for doing this i see no excuse for this if it was uneven skin tone then they just as easily could have made her a tone darker but they did not do that they made her white
2073592 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2073593 we know that this is fairly common practice but that doesnt make it excusable
2073594 this sort of thing creates a negative perception of african beauty
2073595 for all the talk of black is beautiful images like this clearly show that weve got a very long way to go yet
2073596 all i know is that beyonc looks remarkably beautiful on that we do not get involved in the colouring of adverts that appear in the magazine that is a matter for lor al
2073597 we believe any such modifications could suggest the view that black is not beautiful we believe that all people should be celebrated as they are

2073700 i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god
2073701 an atheist loves himself and his fellow man instead of a god an atheist knows that heaven is something for which we should work now here on earth for all men together to enjoy an atheist thinks that he can get no help through prayer but that he must find in himself the inner conviction and strength to meet life to grapple with it to subdue and enjoy it an atheist thinks that only in a knowledge of himself and a knowledge of his fellow man he can find the understanding that will help to a life of fulfillment therefore he seeks to know himself and his fellow man rather than to know a god an atheist knows that a hospital should be built instead of a church an atheist knows that a deed must be done instead of a prayer said an atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death he wants disease conquered poverty vanquished war eliminated he wants man to understand and love man he wants an ethic al way of life he knows that we cannot rely on a god nor channel action into prayer nor hope for an end to troubles in the hereafter he knows that we are our brothers keeper and keepers of our lives that we are responsible persons that the job is here and the time is now

2073747 the great fact to be realized regarding nature is that it is natural we may pervert the order of nature but it will prevail in the long run returning by the back door even through we drive it out with a pitchfork the beginning middle and end of the law of nature is the principle of growth from a vitality that exists in the entity itself
2073748 there is a point where the director must stop directing and leave himself and other participants to do what they want or rather what the unknown quality which has taken their place wants to do direction can come only or mainly from accumulated notional memories of past experience form the conceptually known but the highest mystical awareness comes only when tehre is no purpose in view however intrinsically excellent but pure openess gods service is perfect freedom and conversely perfect freedom is gods service and where there is a director with a scientific or even an ethical purpose perfect freedom cannot exist

2073750 objective observation of the orgone energy revealed that it is present in the atmosphere is related to the sun extends through all space like
2073751 from continued observations and experiments reich little by little formulated a number of general laws and principles of orgone and its functioning i shall enumerate the most important of these 1 being mass free orgone energy itself has no inertia thus making it difficult to measure with conventional techniques 2 orgone energy is universal and ubiquitous filling all space although in differing degrees 3 it is the medium for electromagnetic and gravitational activity it is held to be the sub stratum of the most fundamental natural phenomena the medium which light moves and electromagnetic and gravitational fields exert force 4 it is negatively entropic orgone energy is attracted to concentrations of itself unlike heat or light which manifest a direction from higher to lower potential an analogy is found in gravitation where the larger bodies attract or pull the smaller 5 matter is created from orgone energy concentration and merging of individual streams of orgone can create matter where none previously existed 6 existing matter can through the action of orgone energy be organized spontaneously into living forms where no life previously existed 7 separate streams of orgone energy may be attracted to each other and then superimpose the superimposition function is held to be the fundamental form of the creative process in free space this superimposition is seen as galaxies and solar systems in the atmosphere these streams converge into a spiral creating hurricanes and cyclones in living nature two separate streams of energy flow together creating living organisms
2073752 geiger counter tubes that have absorbed orgone energy by being kept in an orgone atmosphere of high concentration for several weeks can produce 25 to 100 impulses per second in the impulse counter at a rotation threshold of 900 1000 volts this rate of impulses amounts to an even rotation of the pointer in an impulse counter in other words orgone energy is capable of delivering a motor force upon completion of control experiments the relevant details will be published
2073753 though human industry in the past 150 years has resorted to brute force rather than elegant design the making and trading of goods can still be a wellspring of creativity productivity and pleasure think of the thriving marketplaces that have enlivened the worlds great cities the cherished objects and materials that transform shelter into soulful dwelling these need not be sacrificed to protect our forests rivers soil and air indeed human industry and habitations can be designed to celebrate interdependence with other living systems transforming the making and consumption of things into a regenerative force design can perform and preserve the extravagant gesture in the marketplace in the human community and in the natural world
2073754 it is now apparent that the command and control breakdown reported as a bent spear incident to the secretary of defense and white house was not the result of a command and control chain of command
2073755 wmr has learned that a u s attack on iran using nuclear and conventional weapons was scheduled to coincide with israels september 6 air attack on a reputed syrian nuclear facility in dayr az zwar near the village of tal abyad in northern syria near the turkish border
2073756 why hasnt the air force or the fbi investigated the 6 8 untimely deaths including three alleged suicides one of a minot weapons guard one of an assistant defense secretary and one of a captain in the super secret air force special commando group as well as alleged fatal vehicle
2073757 he then points out a physical reality that can not be shrugged aside
2073758 the united states also does not transport nuclear weapons meant for elimination attached to their launch vehicles under the wings of a combat aircraft the procedure is to separate the warhead from the missile encase the warhead and transport it by military cargo aircraft to a repository not an operational bomber base that just happens to be the staging area for middle eastern operations

2073789 then suddenly the mole felt a great awe fall upon him an awe that turned his muscles to water bowed his head and rooted his feet to the ground it was no panic terror indeed he felt wonderfully at peace and happy but it was an awe that smote and held him and without seeing he knew it could only mean that some august presence was very very near with difficulty he turned to look for his friend and saw him at his side cowed stricken and trembling violently and still there was utter silence in the populous bird haunted branches around them and still the light grew and grew perhaps he would never have dared to raise his eyes but that though the piping was now hushed the call and the summons seemed still dominant and imperious he might not refuse were death himself waiting to strike him instantly once he had looked with mortal eye on things rightly kept hidden trembling he obeyed and raised his humble head and then in that utter clearness of the imminent dawn while nature flushed with fulness of incredible colour seemed to hold her breath for the event he looked in the very eyes of the friend and helper

2073796 it is still an open question for the future whether this small group of neanderthals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game lead researcher richard green said
2073797 theres no proof that they saw each other only that they inhabited the same place at about the same time but i think its likely that they came across one another
2073798 we have got tantalising evidence that the neanderthals formed a small population and we can speculate as to what happened to them small population sizes are always more prone to extinction and they have a greater chance of something going wrong

2073804 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2073805 celebrities whose marriages in their intimate details become public knowledge are usually steering the attention themselves
2073806 the motives may vary leverage in the negotiation or settlement process personal revenge or publicity for publicitys sake the celebrity through his or her pr agent is usually the one opening the door settlements can easily be kept confidential its a private contract
2073807 having a client in the press can certainly boost a films numbers
2073808 look at the recent batman film with what happened to heath ledger and christian bale and now morgan freeman it didnt hurt some people definitely use divorce as a way to get some press of course most of them do not want that kind of coverage its too personal and too painful and i remember that uma thurman and ethan hawke spent a lot of time trying to keep their separation private with quite a lot of success
2073809 people sit in los angeles superior court sifting through papers and they do the same in orange county superior court where whitney houston and bobby brown went thinking they could keep their divorce quiet
2073810 if you have any hint of contention in those papers anything salacious or possibly scandalous or if theres a big pre nup involved then there can be trouble
2073811 judges can be made to handle the whole case so those involved dont even have to go to court
2073812 after the petition is lodged all negotiations can take place behind the scenes and the settlement will never be announced in open court it usually suits both sides to work that way often a celebrity will have a pre marital agreement that guarantees the spouse far less than he or she would normally be entitled to but if they agree to keep quiet they can profit financially from the deal its a useful bargaining chip

2073829 our research links two major determinants for early and late onset alzheimers disease
2073830 and weve shown that the process that links them is implicated in brain cholesterol metabolism
2073831 the studies of statins and alzheimers have generated quite a bit of controversy
2073832 those that show positive effects from statins seem to suggest that high cholesterol could increase the risk of alzheimers disease but other evidence contradicts this idea
2073833 the brain represents only about 2 percent of your body weight but actually has about 20 percent of your bodys cholesterol
2073834 there is strong evidence that cholesterol is important for synaptic function and is an essential component of cell membranes in the brain and i believe partial defects in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the brain likely contribute to the development of alzheimers
2073835 cholesterol metabolism in the brain is an understudied area and our findings could inspire alzheimers researchers to look further into the role of the cholesterol pathway
2073836 right now research on alzheimers treatment focuses largely on reducing a beta production or increasing its clearance from the brain our study suggests that there could be an alternate way to treat the disease perhaps by modulating the function of apolipoprotein e and cholesterol in the brain

2073877 during the destruction of the first beis hamikdash the young kohanim took the keys to the sanctuary climbed up to the roof and threw them up toward heaven they said that since they were no longer able to serve as faithful trustees hashem should assume the responsibility for the mikdash something that appeared to have the form of a hand descended and took the keys and the kohanim leapt into the flames
2073878 this teaches us a powerful lesson the torah is not our personal business concern over which we have independent control in our own enterprise we have the authority to sell off a product for a song in order to ensure that we have a good turnover until we build up the business and can sell at a profit but the torah is not something that we own something that we can decide to alter by sacrificing certain halachos to ensure that it will sell for the time being until the market is better
2073879 if we cannot accomplish our aims in accordance with the halachah we accept that our hands are tied and do not act we are only gizborim trustees we are not owners of the torah with the latitude to alter it and do with it as we wish
2073880 i was the youngest and only girl so i sided with my mom as a stanford fan and my two brothers sided with my dad we always had season tickets to stanford football because there were several families on the block that were stanford fans or grads as a result i grew up wanting to go to stanford
2073881 i had her dressed in red and white all the time
2073882 at 3 she would have her pompons and sing the dirty golden bear for company all the time we were very connected to stanford sports wise

2073886 id visited here before so i kind of knew what i was getting myself into luckily just having san francisco which is something i can relate to and being close to the sea those little bits that remind me of home coming to berkeley has been a great experience because its reality its not just a campus school its a town and youre out there i love it over here its just been a great move i do miss my family a lot and talk to them quite often using the webcam my parents come to visit and do go home for competitions so i see them a fair bit im getting used to it now this reality that im not going to see them every day anymore
2073887 i just feel a lot more confident than i did last time coming over here and then having to go back for my trials id been in a different situation from other people back in hong kong i knew that if i wanted their support for me being over here and not being there then i had to prove that what i was doing was good for me and the right decision so i went over there and i just said im going to do it i did my best performances over there and it was one of the first times ive actually performed well at home so it was good
2073888 this team is amazing ive never had a team before really at home to come in here with a bunch of girls its just continuous support for each other ive never had so many people just going for me and wanting me to do well and make me feel part of a swimming family its just great to have people that i can turn to i finally feel like im at home here and having these people around me is the best thing

2073989 this seems to me to be an attack upon the state itself
2073990 the monarch is the one embodiment of the state which is outside the political partisan process
2073991 the people behind this campaign must either oppose the idea of anyone who is non partisan having a role in the affairs of state or they would rather be swearing allegiance to brussels
2073992 recognises that some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch

2074004 educators turn to new applications like timebridge to bring students and colleagues together
2074005 its great because it works across all time zones so everybody can see the proposed times within their own schedule and respond accordingly it now takes at most 24 hours to schedule a meeting that used to take six or seven days it was a nightmare these projects would really not be possible without timebridge because we would not be able to get together to plan and strategize
2074006 we all have tiny windows of time before between and after classes so our availability is really limited using timebridge to schedule our meetings allows all of us to make the most of our time
2074007 ive been able to meet with students who i could never get to come see me before
2074008 students would much rather communicate via email or some other digital means than receiving a phone call to schedule a meeting
2074009 so now when i receive an email from a student asking to meet with me i simply respond with a timebridge invite offering a few times for them to pick from it gets the meeting scheduled much more quickly and everyone is more comfortable with the process its allowed me to strengthen and build new relationships with students

2074030 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2074031 i want to be there because i have some cases and want to know what is the best option without having my client detained wrongfully and all that
2074032 first of all coming from these groups im not surprised because again they are playing to these religious sentiments
2074033 i dont know for sure whether these sentiments reflect what is on the ground because the isssue is still an economic issue but this whole thing is spoken about by these so called representatives of malay muslims taking the extreme line
2074034 yesterday the religious affairs minister in the prime ministers department zahid hamidi said we will not allow this forum to go on he sounded like a mob leader planning to stop it at all costs she said
2074035 the issue is in reality there are laws on conversion and non conversion apostasy and things like that which are affecting both muslims and non muslims so they have a right to speak about it marriages are broken up children are being converted its not like they are trying to speak about somebody elses laws and it does not have anything to do with them
2074036 i believe there are speakers from the other side as well in the sense that the syariah people will be speaking so i dont see what the big deal is its as if its a big threat and a one sided forum not just in name of freedom of expression but sitting down and talking about it i dont think we should be cowed by all these threats
2074037 i find it strange that for example the persatuan pengguna islam is saying that we should have a musyawarah kind of concept when thats exactly what the forum is about musyawarah means sitting down and talking about it and between different groups of people and thats exactly what the bar council forum is about there are people with different views around and talking in a most civil manner i dont know what they want they want to just stop this i dont see any alternative option being put about by the groups opposing it
2074038 it depends on their agenda it should be about the implementation of islamic laws the partner in the marriage where one party has converted to islam should be able to seek redress in syariah courts
2074039 the syariah court should be allowed to hear cases filed by non muslims
2074040 it is important to have a public discussion on conversion because so many cases have come to the fore where individuals and families are affected because of conversion in and out of islam
2074041 more crucial is the fact that those who have converted out are finding no redress in the civil courts due to complications arising out of the interpretations of article 121 1a with regard to jurisdiction of civil and syariah courts
2074042 a way must be found to protect the legitimate rights as enshrined in the federal constitution of citizens when they seek relief and justice through the civil courts
2074043 although some quarters object it does not mean a solution acceptable to muslims and non muslims is in place till a solution is found the rakyat has a right to sensibly discuss the issue notwithstanding the bar council and to propose solutions to the problems
2074044 the issues related to conversion are intrinsically connected to the question of law and therefore should not be politicised as a religious issue those objecting want to impress their conservative theological interpretations on the matter and not regard it as a rights based matter
2074045 i have my hindu sangam cwc meeting you see i cant postpone because members are coming from all over the country being the president i cant skip my own cwc meeting
2074046 on too many occasions the judiciary has not lived up to the expectations of the non muslim rakyat
2074047 non muslims are terrified at pronouncements by the courts that one parent can convert our children to islam even if the other parent does not consent
2074048 were probably going to have more dialogues with the muslim groups later we already had one two weeks ago closed door so maybe in another two weeks well have another
2074049 were working on a committee basis the perpaduan panel appointed an inter religious committee so were working on that
2074050 were able to speak more freely when its a closed door when its an open door its very difficult
2074051 but whoever is conducting the public dialogue the moderator must be good just like you know anwar ibrahim and shabery had a big open public dialogue if you have good a moderator it will be conducted well it should not go out of hand
2074052 my position has always been that you should always have an open attitude in giving democratic space
2074053 but there are now sensitivities raised so whether it is effective if you have an open forum and seen to be too provocative or have a more closed door affair so discussions can take place without being seen as too provocative
2074054 i would personally advise if they were to proceed at least at this stage to allay fears of others have closed forum deal with it then engage with the rest particularly those who have expressed concerns
2074055 i would choose that in fact early last year i did initiate a forum on contentious issues of apostasy and conversion but in a closed forum amongst muslims
2074056 yes i was criticised why it was necessary but i said at least it allowed people to express themselves and allay fears anxieties and insecurities that religious beliefs are being maligned
2074057 these concerns are real my personal view is it should be a closed affair because i have received word from muslim groups that it is not substance they are against but attempts to denigrate islam i may not

2074060 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2074061 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2074062 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2074063 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran

2074067 it is not the practice of the national jewish democratic council to get involved in democratic primaries but in the race between representative steve cohen d tn and nikki tinker the tone of attack is cause for serious concerns earlier in the campaign when blatantly anti semitic fliers were circulated tinker distanced herself from such troublesome tactics being injected into her race yet in tinkers last ad going into todays primary election she clearly crossed the line and approved a totally inappropriate and divisive message in her attack on cohen these types of attacks are disturbing and have no place in politics

2074177 we believe it is critical to send a strong message that conservation and foods programs cannot always be the source of dollars for other programs
2074178 if u s agriculture is to remain competitive we must have adequate funding to keep our farmers and ranchers economically viable to better protect our nations most strategic natural resources and to provide our citizens access to healthy foods and the environmental benefits our producers provide our future depends on making good budget choices today

2074201 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had

2074216 in 2007 the metropolitan council debated resolutions and ordinances relating to the use of the english language by the metropolitan government
2074217 because that effort failed councilman crafton is endeavoring to go to the people via the initiative process to place into the bedrock document governing metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county his preferred language on the subject
2074218 the language that the councilman chose to use is not what i suggested to him in our earlier debates
2074219 just as councilman crafton has the right to try to pass his proposed charter amendment those who oppose it have every right to argue their position and to seek the amendments defeat in the polls if the matter is eventually placed on the november 2008 ballot
2074220 as citizen foster i can share my thoughts with my friends and neighbors asking them to vote this way or that

2074239 every single person is going to be a level of seriousness
2074240 you know tell us how youre going to get there from maine
2074241 we ask them and encourage them to register voters and to get out the vote and those activities that are important to us its not a requirement but its going to be an encouragement
2074242 nothing besides their own campaign choices and base enthusiasm is stopping them from matching democratic partisans new voter for new voter in which case the bump would be canceled out
2074243 but how many white christian conservatives are there left out there to register im simplifying but its hard to find republican demographic groups that are under registered right now
2074244 a sweeping voter registration campaign in heavily democratic areas has added tens of thousands of new voters to the rolls in the swing states of ohio and florida a surge that has far exceeded the efforts of republicans in both states a review of registration data shows
2074245 washington has cast its eleven electoral college votes for democratic candidates in the last six elections in 2004 john kerry took the state by a 53 to 46 margin
2074246 i remember after t he 04 election karl rove something among the likes of if we knew the polling of a state was 1 to 3 points one way or the other we would win the state
2074247 indeed the only reason why bills speech wont upstage obamas is because obama is such a strong orator it will possibly upstage his wifes and probably upstage the vice presidents
2074248 on the other hand in the decisive state ohio gotv and voter fraud did decide the election the gooper turnout nullified the strong work done by kerry and company
2074249 leaners accounted for 7 points and mccain got 5 of them and obama 2 this last should worry yall
2074250 look if obama leads by 4 7 in michigan its not possible than he leads only by 1 in the rasmussen tracking
2074251 lately i have heard two or three different political pundits on tv say that bush gore or both are willing to
2074252 i heard you and aunt constance going to the mat about poor old phyllis
2074253 how do leaners break in oh and pa i am thinking the pattern is more like mi than mo which is probably more like nj
2074254 the stability in the gallup and ras trackers confirms the existence of the bradley effect
2074255 that fails to supply the positive reason that many bradley effect voters need to become more expressive
2074256 how do you know the bradley effect is gone it is a psychological phenomenon and very much a product of its time and place if anything this one is much more like the original governor bradley race than the senator ford one
2074257 obama has held his lead among women and has improved 7 among men but still he is down 1 since july i guess mccain is doing better with the independent gender voters this month
2074258 im voting for mccain because obama said did x y and z
2074259 then if rasmussen had weighted for gender this month would be a 3 4 improvement for obama pete are you there

2074319 it was strange i hadnt encountered anything like it before i wanted to make sure so i asked the cashier what the discount was and why he was not giving it to me
2074320 he insisted that it wasnt a discount but i said cancel the purchase and scan it again so he relented and said its a discount only for minorities
2074321 i asked him what it meant and he said a discount only for arabs i said what do you mean if i was arab you would give me a discount he said yes definitively it was really strange i decided not to argue and to forgo the discount so i paid full price for the products i had purchased
2074322 i didnt expect to get a discount but i was appalled when i realized that had i been arab i would have received one i tried to think what would happen if it was a discount only for jews or sephardim or ashkenazim

2074326 it can get down to boeing saying how many order and assembly specialists do you need to assemble 50 first class lavatories in three months
2074327 boeing and the contractors will work out the cost changes later the important thing is to avoid totally unacceptable delivery delays you cant have the delivery of an otherwise flight ready 777 delayed for two or more months because it lacks two specialized lavatories and 50 business class seats

2074408 if he was going to have a mediocre season that led to the jets drafting another qb then favres presence doesnt hurt them one bit
2074409 manager sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and it was felt the best thing would be for me to stay
2074410 i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
2074411 i flew to portugal some weeks ago and we cleared the air and he spoke to some of the players
2074412 the boy has been through a troubled time in terms of the approaches from spain but once he knew my stance he then settled down
2074413 the fans have got to understand its very difficult when a young boy is tempted by all this money
2074414 we can put this to bed now its finished and the boy is a manchester united player and thats the most important thing
2074415 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
2074416 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
2074417 i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
2074418 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
2074419 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness
2074420 he was free to do what he wanted and its a shame that he isnt coming to us because hes a player who would really have improved this great group
2074421 but hey it doesnt matter weve got a great group to get started on an important league campaign and fight for all the objectives weve set
2074422 he may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot but dont let that fool you he really is an idiot
2074423 his mind is so open so open that ideas simply pass through it
2074424 are you always this stupid or are you making a special effort today
2074425 brains arent everything in fact in your case theyre nothing
2074426 avoid all needle drugs the only dope worth shooting is richard nixon
2074427 a sharp tongue does not mean you have a keen mind
2074428 dont let you mind wander its far too small to be let out on its own
2074429 he always finds himself lost in thought its an unfamiliar territory
2074430 i dont know what makes you so dumb but it really works
2074431 i dont think you are a fool but whats my opinion compared to that of thousands of others

2074433 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2074434 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2074435 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2074436 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2074437 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2074438 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2074439 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2074440 how can you not pay attention to whats going on
2074441 its historic as a kid youre told you can do anything just put your mind to it and for a long time for women for blacks that wasnt necessarily the case now hillary made that dream a reality when my daughter says i want to be president its like yeah you have a shot same for my son he can be president one day

2074460 it is now becoming clear that the canadian housing market is continuing to cool as the level of activity moderates to more sustainable levels
2074461 and we expect this correction to continue at a measured and orderly pace
2074462 it does look like canadian houses finally got too expensive and builders too aggressive for the underlying demand environment
2074463 we expect this will translate into a broadly flat profile for canadian house prices ahead with the markets of western canada most vulnerable to outright declines

2074476 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side
2074477 i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter
2074478 it was a tough one it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
2074479 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around
2074480 it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and go out there when we had the ball on an opportunity to close it out and we did just that

2074522 crying would take us nowhere it is time to speak up and be counted if we love our country we must not allow crooks and charlatans to rape and steal it from us
2074523 it is ours this country of many races and religions we must stand together we the concerned malaysians and defend our heritage
2074524 now all these dreams seem to have faded away we are involved in political wrangling of all kinds our leaders seem to be uncertain about what to do our foreign policy is in disarray and so on
2074525 we have lost our direction and we get no guidance
2074526 everything is about what is in it for me even the ordinary members of once respected political parties want something for themselves jobs posts titles contracts and filthy lucre are the only things which matter

2074541 speculation on the superstars future has been top headline in both north america and sweden and the hockey world is waiting with bated breath for his decision
2074542 it is not at all difficult i have had a fantastic summer and took it easy it is good to rest physically and mentally from hockey and to be able to come up with a good decision
2074543 the interest has been incredible from all over the nhl
2074544 the fact that so many clubs and players both swedish and foreign have spoken of the situation is great fun but only one person can make the decision about whether i should continue and that is me
2074545 it will be either to reduce or completely eliminate import players
2074546 but before we do something we want to get a position and take it to our canadian hockey league partners
2074547 my personal opinion is that 10 years ago or maybe longer now the decision to bring import players to the chl was something very good now its getting tougher to bring those players second we must look at the calibre of players we are bringing over now third we must look and see if we can improve the situation we have with them
2074548 to be honest the last 20 games of the season there were a lot of other things on my mind
2074549 its a bad accident and you almost lose your teammate and especially when youre involved even though it was an accident it takes a lot out of you and to be honest there were a lot bigger things than hockey in that process
2074550 but whatevers been happening in the past for me there is no reason to look back
2074551 youre as good as your last game and that wasnt very good so i definitely want to look forward and put everything behind

2074562 while i could not call alex a close friend we had talked and he had provided useful contacts when i was writing about russian organized crime
2074563 using the blunt scalpel on common sense and as much of an investigation as i could muster i concluded last year that alex was murdered not by agents sent by putin but by his friends
2074564 although i am steeped in conspiracy research i believe that probably only 5 would qualify as genuine conspiracies and even then determining those responsible is exceptionally difficult
2074565 nekrasovs problem is that he takes that one conspiracy the death of alex means proof of another
2074566 i have recently turned down writing a book on russian crime because of the possibility of writing both safely and accurately is limited the subject fascinates and is worthy of study but i feared i would only end up producing another partisan emotional mess like nekrasov

2074838 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2074839 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2074840 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2074841 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here

2074845 the official position that waterboarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
2074846 its just something theyre trying to make a quick buck off i guess
2074847 i think its educational because everyone hears about waterboarding but no one really knows what it is
2074848 i feel more strongly about that yes having seen this
2074849 when they have the sideshow you see real people thats legit but this here uh uh
2074850 because it gives us a chance to be political and silly at the same time
2074851 robot waterboarding became a way of exploring the issue without doing any harm
2074852 the group who most stands to benefit from the knowledge
2074853 our hope is that it forces a consideration of an issue that people may not be thinking about but they should be thinking about
2074854 adults find it very shocking and kids are like that stinks theyre so desensitized they have no idea what the ethical issues are they wish there was water spraying in their face
2074855 waterboarding sweetie is a kind of torture where they pour water on peoples faces so they feel like theyre drowning but then there was a big controversy because a lot of americans are saying you shouldnt torture people even if they are terrorists
2074856 the pressure on the scholarship line to support families has been at the highest point that they have seen in many many years
2074857 in my time i havent seen this type of situation from a sense of pressure on the percentage of dollars they are being asked to use to support their campers
2074858 on average a three week camping experience in california is about 3 200 and if there are multiple siblings for some people there is just no way you can afford that
2074859 its a catch 22 situation because often times when need is greatest funding is the lowest and that is goign to be the conundrum going forward
2074860 the question is how long can we sustain this if it is one season we will be ok but the question is will it be multiple years

2074865 the elections are especially vital to iraqs disenfranchised sunnis who boycotted the last provincial elections in 2005
2074866 provincial elections are needed to allow emerging sunni elites a chance to gain a seat at the table and make a legitimate claim to political power and the patronage resources that flow from that power

2074880 no new taxes one week and then support them on your featured issue the next
2074881 considering how close thune and graham are to mccain do you think that they would even allow obama to support the bill and move it forward i think it is more likely that they will find some way to sabotage the bill if obama comes out so strongly in support of it because they will understand the political implications
2074882 on rasmussens daily tracker it appears there has been a flip on voter sentiment on who would do a better job on many important issues they keep trending more and more toward mccain
2074883 after all closing the war down in iraq will be the biggest depressant on oil pricesin
2074884 i do not think anything will get passed this term though why would either side of the aisle want to give bush the luxury of improving his legacy by passing a last minute bipartisan bill he has wanted he isnt helping either side of the aisle right now
2074885 washington finally made some progress in this its a plan that will invest in renewable fuels and fuel efficient cars like all compromises this has its drawbacks a limited amount of off shore drilling im willing to consider it if its going to pass
2074886 he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes
2074887 rasmussen shows no signs of moving back toward obama and gallup has again shown his lead melting down imagine a world where mccain sustained a lead over obama for a period of time unfathomable well see
2074888 im willing to consider it if its going to pass
2074889 drilling isnt really very useful or helpful but if compromising on this minor point is the only way were going to get a plan that actually helps people past a filibuster then compromising is worth the benefits
2074890 you have not gone to iraq in 900 days and you never talk to our generals on the ground
2074891 thats too simplistic and its annoying that the republicans dont get out on front of that issue the 1990s boom wasnt due to higher taxes it was business growth overcoming those hikes and tax cuts in the 2000s didnt create an economic downturn tax cuts helped make that downturn less painful
2074892 obama will raise your taxes and it will destroy our economy
2074893 drilling is utterly useless so of course the republicans are for it
2074894 surveyusa also cooked the books in its poll in fla showing mccain 6 they used 43 rep 38 dem 17 ind as of july 1 37 r 41 dem 22 ind he gave repub 5 in affiliation when they are actaully 4 dem

2074906 anche io sottolinea il ministro credo che il regime cinese possa finalmente aprirsi ai diritti umani grazie allopportunit offerta dallolimpiade ma non sono convinta che questo possa avvenire senza le pressioni della comunit internazionale semplicemente fidandosi delle promesse del governo di pechino da quando sono stati assegnati i giochi alla cina tutti gli impegni contratti in questo senso sono stati disattesi

2074932 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior

2074945 drivers need to be prepared for what we think theyre likely to see when they get their next renewal notice from their insurer and that is theyll see their premiums go up
2074946 because this is the fourth consecutive quarter that our findings have shown an increase in rates quoted year over year
2074947 auto insurance consumers should not only watch their renewal notices closely but they should also know that they have options just because your insurer raised your rate doesnt mean that a better rate isnt available elsewhere in fact it is during these times when shopping around for your auto insurance is most important and when you have the best chance for significant savings because no two insurance companies price their products exactly the same

2074949 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
2074950 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
2074951 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
2074952 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
2074953 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year

2074956 ignorance breeds fear fear fosters hate in turn hate leads inevitably to violence when will we acknowledge the fact once and for all that it is the incompetents among us who consistently promulgate violence as a solution for anything to everything we must strive to forget nevermore that rationalizations supporting the use of violence other than the need for the rightful exercise of self defense when set upon by a genuinely clear present and immediate danger invariably constitute deceitful fabrications meant to conceal disguise or justify incompetence including our very own for embracing such mendacity

2074992 if something doesnt happen to correct itself soon its going to raise some red flags for us
2074993 i dont know why we havent dropped to less than 4 a gallon we should get there soon when i saw that seattle dropped below 4 i thought for sure wed be right on their coattails but boy the market was slow to react and i start to raise my eyebrows
2074994 it seems to happen every time prices start falling elsewhere alaskas doesnt fall its not surprising but that doesnt make it right
2074995 the funny thing is alaska prices are pretty reactive on the way up but slower on the way down
2074996 my guess is that demand up here has not fallen as precipitously as in the lower 48 and therefore retailers are not feeling as compelled to drop prices as quickly thats capitalism
2074997 we get complaints all the time we tell them its a fair market and people charge what they think the market can bear if were getting most of our gas from in state refineries youve gotta look at our salaries which are generally higher but really i have no idea theres no good answer other than its what the market bears
2074998 a lot of time distributors will say it must be the tax alaskas tax is the lowest in the nation and theres no tax at all on home heating fuel
2074999 my chief economist tells me its because small markets generally respond to price changes slower and alaska is a tiny tiny market when it comes to motor fuels
2075000 people dont understand that its a free market its not a regulated industry it can only be explained by market forces
2075001 im not sure why the retail numbers in alaska are so much above the lower 48 range while u s demand is down on a nationwide basis it may be that some of the energy active states have stronger demand this is the case in texas albeit to a small degree
2075002 im not familiar with any particular global or local problem that has kept alaska prices so high needless to say its a market that doesnt have many of the high volume chains that operate in the lower 48
2075003 people say wait a minute it only costs this much to get oil this much to refine it this much to get it to the station so how come were paying so much more
2075004 theres a fundamental misperception that retailers should only sell for what it cost them and a little bit more no law says they have to do that you have to rely on the market to do that

2075048 this has been on the cards for the last two to three months these are issues which are alive and relating to people who have suffered from this conflict of laws we need to look for avenues for them to voice their grievances as well
2075049 it may be controversial but that doesnt mean you dont talk about these issues if it is emotive if it is sensitive we still have to talk about discuss these things that is our position you need to discuss
2075050 what were saying is its not an issue of conversion were not questioning article 121 1a were not questioning article 3 of the federal constitution on the status of islam when you have two jurisdictions the civil and the syariah jurisdiction obviously there will be conflicts of law
2075051 when you have conflicts of law you need to resolve these conflicts this is what were looking at how do you resolve these issues that is all
2075052 weve got people from both sides with different opinions and we want to find out one understanding of the problem also we want to find out why people have such an opinion we need to know also you see and we want to put forward our views because the first way to reach an amicable solution is to understand each others views

2075057 fleshly desire the things of the flesh or even sin
2075058 i know that there is nothing better for humanity than to be happy and do good while they live that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his work this is the gift of god
2075059 have you ever rushed passed pleasure in search of it
2075060 is it possible that we are taught to rush past pleasure
2075061 obviously an o r bond probably wasnt the best method of assuring that he would appear in court
2075062 he didnt escape he didnt abscond he didnt do any of those things
2075063 he was told that he was released and he was in a wheelchair and he rolled out
2075064 think about it seven days a week three shifts its a budget problem
2075065 i think thats the reason the o r bond was granted
2075066 i think thats the reason why the sheriffs department instructed them to release him this is all about money
2075067 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession

2075077 so terry what if drinking the blood of your victims is wrong
2075078 so much hatred for a man who made his career in science but he shouldnt have said anything about the house of cards that is religion should he
2075079 just out of curiosity since dawkins apparently doesnt cut it with you guys is there any atheist or critic of religion that you would endorse instead or are they all as bad maybe it comes with the territory since atheism sucks and you know that you are right anyway so whatever atheists might have to say is crap anyway what was that called again presuppositionalism also known as the ostrich maneuver
2075080 funny you should mention because we get that a lot
2075081 so whatever atheists might have to say is crap anyway
2075082 but now that were at it can i ask you what if youre wrong about god jesus the whole shebang of christianity
2075083 and what evidence would it take to convince you that youre wrong
2075084 i will save person x if person x deposits five gold pieces into a bronze box by morning
2075085 i dont like name calling but if thats the only way to get through to you then tit for tat it is
2075086 incidentally tit for tat might give you a clue where morals originally came from as i wrote in a comment before atheism is not a moral system we think that all human beings develop a moral system from a number of natural sources including evolution upbringing and community read something by e g steven pinker this article is a good start moral instinct or this recent economist article
2075087 cannot delve into his worldview for morals but he has to borrow from something else
2075088 what evidence would it take to convince you that youre wrong
2075089 well has your opinion about the wood construction issue changed
2075090 well did you find the plot well developed and the characters believable
2075091 hmm imagine id just lent you the logger and you were handing it back and i asked well what would you say
2075092 is there any thing that wouldnt be worth doing to get some chocolate ice cream
2075093 well is there anything that wouldnt be worth doing to get some strawberry ice cream
2075094 how would your behavior morality and means of pursuing truth change if you were wrong about the non existence of yahweh and what manner of apologies would you need to make
2075095 how would your behavior etcetc change if you were wrong about the non existence of the hindu pantheon
2075096 how would etc etc wrong about the non existence of the flying spaghetti monster
2075097 but even animals have shown to possess a form of basic moral instinct in reciprocal altruism
2075098 you really dont know how to read for the third time it is not the atheism worldview per se that contains a moral system so your statements that the atheist
2075099 fascinating can you list the specific parts that were personally written by god and how do you know that he personally wrote just those bits and not the others
2075100 well that was a quick trip to the bottom of your barrel you gave an example of something that is not in the bible not something that is in the bible that you can absolutely and incontrovertibly attribute directly to the hand mouth of god
2075101 if a city that i have chosen to destroy repents before i do then i will spare them
2075102 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
2075103 3 actual proof that the bible particularly the gospels are overall untrustworthy false
2075104 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
2075105 3 actual proof that the bible particularly the gospels are overall untrustworthy false
2075106 you seem to be stuck in a loop you have jumped back to regurgitate questions that have already been answered i have no idea what your confusion is about and why youre typing in all caps
2075107 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
2075108 well write this in a way so they wont have to study how you guys wrote itll be easier for them
2075109 before accepting your challenge to look for inaccurate statements from god we first need to know which statements are from god and which are not
2075110 if those quotes were man made then you should have no problem finding fault with them
2075111 and you misunderstood what the guy said he said that people only think dawkins is super intellignet because of his accent he didnt say thats how he judges dawkins you should read
2075112 wow do you honestly think that is literal i suppose atheists are tree branches then wow i said not out of context
2075113 i asked for new testament verses and you already explained why i did so why did you go and get an exodus verse
2075114 if this is true and genesis was not a story then please explain how the ancients were so stupid as to write that daylight came before the sun
2075115 and some of these people were later found to have not been direct sons and daughters but grandchildren and great grandchildren of the people who
2075116 and is god supposed to predict how people will read in three thousamnd years and go
2075117 the light in the beginning was god then the sun was created
2075118 i did this but youre eventually going to find out that it didnt happen in that order and it took a lot longer and dont listen to hovind and natural history museums that have man and dinosaurs co existing have little to do with either nature or history and someone wake up that guy in the fifth row this stuffs important
2075119 i simply love it when atheists use the holy spirit as if they should have a remote idea of how he works
2075120 since you obviously know more about my worldview than i please give me some pointers
2075121 i agree while i think aig has some decent theology their natural science is pathetic
2075122 if the author of genesis wrote that he would be considered a maniac considering the fact that museums kent hovind dinosaurs the words
2075123 youre right terry that clip of dawkins was really sucky thats why atheism sucks so bad
2075124 l said jeez i didnt misunderstand at all this place is just full of vitriol isnt it sometimes when perusing the blogosphere i should be more careful and only stop at intelligent places what is it with you people cant you debate without getting nasty a little politeness goes a long way pointing out where i misread something according to you would be taken better if it was done with less nastiness you did misunderstand oh and lecturing me on being polite and intelligent is a bad idea especially since 1 you use challengereligion com another atheistic propoganda website that hatefully spews false information as if they cant do anything else odd 2 i value your opinion of me about as much as i value the present my dog left in the yard 4 37 pm l said oh and you dont have to be a theologist to have an opinion which is what dawkins has theologists and churches religionists in general have always tried to limit discussion and opinion about religion to a few so called experts why should it continue to be that way well because they like their power dont they just an opinion then why does he try to pass it off as fact why do hundreds of people accpet it as fact because they think it comes from an expert on the matter which dawkins is not real experts however have told him how wrong he is and people still blindly follow him if all he had was an opinion he wouldnt be writing books about it 4 39 pm

2075142 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
2075143 what is the uniform of a true soldier of christ jesus

2075145 for we wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places

2075153 in vancouver you have a sheet of five pages of meal places in victoria its one sheet if you miss the window theres very little else eating is far more of a challenge

2075155 i was quite shocked at how little food is available
2075156 it was all about personal learning and growth and being dependent on other peoples kindness to survive
2075157 it means almost doubling our staff because we provide such a multitude of services

2075181 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
2075182 there was so much to grok so little to grok from

2075189 why wasnt this manhole marked where were the warning and caution signs markings red flags
2075190 did you see a huge red flag when you were crossing the border
2075191 and the fact that theyre living in these ridiculous stick built homes up there in the wind in that amazing country just blows my mind
2075192 i met a guy that had six kids in one room with bunk beds stacked to the ceiling
2075193 if you can build a sustainable community in anaktuvuk you can build a sustainable community anywhere in the world
2075194 whether you live in minnesota or arizona you walk inside and you get 65 to 72 degrees everywhere in america
2075195 but that doesnt mean you want to have your skins clothing or your food in a place thats too hot
2075196 so there has to be these zones for different activities and thats very different from what we understand
2075197 basically were working on a waterproof efficient skin and shell and were earth banking it
2075198 it becomes like a monolithic pool liner with no seams because water will creep in anywhere theres a lack of material
2075199 if theres no seams theres no cracks like a dairy queen cone
2075200 earth banking tempers the exterior environment so it tones it down
2075201 if you have a house and you put it into the wind the wind will hit it and tumble around and this is where the drift will be
2075202 the wind would scour it clean however it would not get too cold in the house
2075203 unlike a lot of retrofits when its a square peg in a round hole this house is already made for it
2075204 you could decimate the area of willows in a hurry in an inefficient home
2075205 native people knew that so up high they always had a vent they could open up and they had enough natural leakage so it would cause natural convection to get rid of the stale air inside the house
2075206 we bring in positive air thats been warmed to fill the envelope with nice warm fresh air and the stale air exhausts passively out the vent at the top
2075207 if you look at anaktuvuk pass or most villages youd see a grid that could be in omaha nebraska
2075208 just absolute silliness with oversized plots that were put there so you could have utilities
2075209 the prototype has to be built incredibly cheaply to show that it can be built cheaply
2075210 if you didnt have staging down correctly you could end up delivering 13 herc loads of materials which is hundreds of thousands of dollars before anyone even picked up a hammer
2075211 imagine you have a set of lincoln logs and a tonka truck and you see how many lincoln logs can fit in the tonka truck
2075212 those take up far less weight and volume than any other kind of insulation
2075213 the earth is a great moderator of temperature it doesnt like to get hot very quickly and it doesnt like to get cold very quickly
2075214 there are fine young men and women in those villages that are ready to build their own house
2075215 what we really have to be clear about here is were not a housing agency
2075216 i put sweat and labor and equity into my home
2075217 just like the habitat for humanity approach you dont get the house unless you work on it
2075218 waiting to do our demonstration house until next summer is driving me crazy

2075220 we got 1 200 dollars and it came in handy

2075224 what happens if instead of a single electron in a quantum well we have two electrons instead how would i solve the schrodinger equation for the wavefunctions
2075225 trying to do the work on your own is 1000 times more enlighting than reading up the solution
2075226 a well managed distressed fund will no doubt do very well and will have great opportunities
2075227 the way to lure cash back into the credit markets is that once you see people making money again that begets more money into the market

2075230 some of the paper we see yields 10 15 percent under very onerous conditions
2075231 even if 100 percent of the mortgages in a pool default the recovery value is probably 50 cents on the dollar or higher thus if youre buying paper at 50 that is backed by first mortgages you are pretty well protected
2075232 most of our investments in the early innings have been in distressed leverage loans versus distressed high yield

2075293 in philosophy a form of argument that is supposed to proceed from a fact to the necessary conditions of its possibility
2075294 for logic to be universally binding trinitarian christianity must be true
2075295 id be careful about c the consistency clause in b already implies law like behavior and so is somewhat rendundent and laws are generally anything but self evident in the particular case of non contradictiion i dont think its taken as a given quantum superposition the cat thing certainly puts some strain on it i think it would be fair to say that theres an expectation that at least some of what goes on in the world will be comprehensible within the bounds of our limited experience and reasoning ability whether that is a presupposition or just a hope or working hypothesis depends on your frame of mind i guess
2075296 1 there exists an external reality which on the macro level
2075297 i meant logic is binding in that it is necessary that there is an oughtness about our following the laws of logic
2075298 me and my bible i dont need a stinkin confession because it divides christians
2075299 then how you know what you are saying is true if it is affected by instinct
2075300 in order for an unbeliever to think the christian god must exist
2075301 i am not aware of anyone declaring a law of noncontradiciton before aristotle
2075302 just because no one castled in chess before x does not necessarily mean that castling pre dated did not pre date x
2075303 in order for an unbeliever to think the christian god must exist
2075304 and this is why the particular presuppositional stance that in attempting to meet the atheists on
2075305 it appears we actually agree or im misunderstanding your point
2075306 i couldnt agree more i dont care at all about
2075307 but for the presuppositionalist argument to be valid you need not only maintain that you would be depressed but that you would be unable to use logic since you dont maintain this presuppositionalism fails god or the bible cant be a
2075308 but for the presuppositionalist argument to be valid you need not only maintain that you would be depressed but that you would be unable to use logic
2075309 there could be other reasons why our universe is uniform such as the islamic god or the mormon god
2075310 1 minor issue people were discussing evolution well before darwin his major contribution was variation and selection 2 major issue evolution is a empirical field of study therefore based upon inductive reasoning and the notion that you can never be completely certain if a given statement is true logic is a formal field of study therefore based upon deductive reasoning and capable of producing statments that are absolutely true when the premises of the logic are accepted
2075311 to my understanding the law of non contradiciton lon is manner of judging an argument as unsound if you dont have a pre existing concept of the lon you cant use it to judge an argument
2075312 it is possible that there is some possible world with a god
2075313 it is possible that there is some possible world without a god
2075314 so in conclusion the universe is consistent and has certain features we evolved in it and therefore developed certain strategies for thinking about its consistent features which we call rationality and we cannot help but use and find compelling why then do we need to presuppose god
2075315 the sun rises and the sun sets and hastening to its place it rises there again
2075316 in the heavens he has placed a tent for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber it rejoices like a strong man to run its course its rising from one end of the heavens and its circuit to the other end of them
2075317 a mule is both a horse and not a horse
2075318 a mule is a horse in description but it is not a horse in identity they are not identical as one horse is to another
2075319 a mule is both a horse and not a horse
2075320 a mule is a horse in description but it is not a horse in identity they are not identical as one horse is to another
2075321 a mule is both a horse and not a horse
2075322 contradictions cannot be held in the same thing at the same time in the same way
2075323 all that aristotle did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075324 contradictions cannot be held in the same thing in the same way at the same time
2075325 a mule is a horse in description but it is not a horse in identity they are not identical as one horse is to another

2075327 a mule is a horse in description but it is not a horse in identity they are not identical as one horse is to another
2075328 did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075329 all aristotle did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075330 the first is true because they are both mammals together the second is true because the horse has one toe and the cow has two
2075331 did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075332 all aristotle did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075333 all aristotle did was discover and define rules that were already in existence
2075334 actually i was fairly clear more than once that a mule is a horse in the same way it is not a horse by parentage
2075335 blank is true in only one way these two ways
2075336 actually i was fairly clear more than once that a mule is a horse in the same way it is not a horse by parentage
2075337 blank is true in only one way these two ways
2075338 ill grant you this for any instance i can bring up where the lon does not fit the statement a sufficiently clever person can parse out differentiations of meanings and apply the lon to those parsings
2075339 i think youre missing the point my claim isnt that the lonc applies to every statement this is clearly false and to be expected the lonc applies as ive stated repeatedly to any given thing in the macro world so this parsing is merely a way of clarifying exactly what a given statement is saying about the macro world because many statements are ambiguous
2075340 and i didnt want to get into the first example
2075341 it is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect
2075342 the magical number seven plus or minus two some limits on our capacity for processing information
2075343 it is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect
2075344 way 1 it consists of 99 water atoms way 2 it consists of 101 total atoms
2075345 im just asking for one of the macro world properties to which the lon universally applies
2075346 im just asking for one of the macro world properties to which the lon universally applies
2075347 a very small amount of water with 33 oxygen atoms 66 hydrogen atoms and one atom each of sodium and chlorine
2075348 just the h2o molecules in that very small amount of water
2075349 do the non water atoms dissolved in water count as being water or not
2075350 reality is too complex for the lonc to be a universal truth
2075351 reality is not too complex for the lonc to be universal truth
2075352 when obama walked on stage at the mccormick center many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so
2075353 during a two minute break halfway through the event which was broadcast live on cnn journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
2075354 this was a convention of journalists not a rally of groupies for obama
2075355 i would think that you give up certain rights when you are a journalist and if you are married to a journalist
2075356 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
2075357 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
2075358 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
2075359 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
2075360 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents

2075390 china ha invertido mucho capital emocional en la apertura de los juegos ol mpicos que comienzan hoy en pek n es un momento de gloria nacional las calles se han limpiado de toda clase de gente poco aconsejable mendigos prostitutas etc todos los derechos humanos y la comunidad legal han sido anulados y los activistas encerrados en prisi n el pueblo est pagando un precio muy alto por la fiesta que estamos viendo en las pantallas de televisi n para conseguir los juegos la ciudad lleg a un compromiso espec fico sobre derechos humanos y libertad de expresi n con el comit ol mpico internacional deber a cumplir su palabra

2075408 es demasiado pronto para asumir que los pol ticos pakistan es acusar n de prevaricaci n al presidente musharraf el mejor aspecto del drama es que el ej rcito bajo un nuevo jefe no est interviniendo aunque querr opinar sobre el sucesor de musharraf el resultado m s probable es que pakist n se salve una vez m s de la desintegraci n en clanes rivales pero cuando musharraf se vaya su sucesor estar menos dispuesto a ayudar a gran breta a y los estados unidos a luchar contra el terrorismo a hacer progresos en afganist n o a hacer de pakist n un pa s normal y pr spero

2075411 our findings suggest a new avenue for designing sirtuin activating drugs
2075412 the jury is still out as to whether a drug of this kind might result in longer life in humans but im equally excited by the possibility that such interventions might help counteract age related health problems like obesity and type ii diabetes
2075413 many drugs have unwanted side effects because in addition to the intended target the drugs also hit other biologically active molecules that you dont want to affect
2075414 this nicotinamide binding site weve identified appears to be unique to the sirtuins so that if were able to design a molecule to target it it should be very specific for these sirtuin molecules
2075415 people have known for some time that low calorie diets result in life extension in many organisms but they didnt know why
2075416 recent research has shown that the connection works at least in part through these sirtuin molecules
2075417 does inhibiting a component of niacin point the way to anti aging drugs
2075418 and now it seems you are going to deconstruct that
2075419 sorry mr gurley they are from yesterday have been in the fridge overnight

2075423 are you on drugs you must be on something ive never ever heard anything so preposterous

2075427 an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law
2075428 krishnas devotees were here chant hare krishna and be free

2075431 my son is a student at rmit and often visits gopals restaurant i dont think im a bad person i was just doing my job you know i did read some of those books we confiscated and also heard your spiritual leader speak at the melbourne town hall it took me a while to understand but i now see his teaching are giving direction and understanding to so many young people today who follow his example
2075432 hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare
2075433 a pure devotee of the lord does not live on any planet of the material sky nor does he feel any contact with material elements his so called material body does not exist being surcharged with the spiritual current of the lords identical interest and thus he is permanently freed from all contaminations of the sum total of the mahat tattva he is always in the spiritual sky which he attains by being transcendental to the sevenfold material covering by the effect of his devotional service the conditioned souls are within the coverings whereas the liberated soul is far beyond the cover
2075434 please always try to remember me by my teachings and we shall always be together just like i have written in the first publications of srimad bhagwatam the spiritual master lives forever by his divine instruction and the disciple lives with him because i have always served my guru maharaj and followed his teachings i am now even never separated from him sometimes maya may come and try to interfere but we must not falter we must always follow the chalked out path layed down by the great acharyas and in the end you will see
2075435 there is no difference between me and my picture therefore we should honor and keep pictures in that spirit if we throw pictures this way and that way that is offence the name and picture are as good as the person in spiritual world in the material world either picture or person everything is illusion

2075456 pong that should give you a sense of my age i loved that game
2075457 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2075458 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2075459 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2075460 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2075461 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2075462 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2075463 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2075464 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2075465 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2075466 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2075467 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2075468 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2075469 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports

2075471 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2075472 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2075473 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2075474 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2075475 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2075476 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2075477 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2075478 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

2075480 its going to be hard fought and mccain has got such a natural appeal i think to some constituencies veterans which are a big portion of the population here some of the retired people
2075481 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs which is true of national polls in the presidential race in which obama supporters are a lot more fired up than mccain supporters are
2075482 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2075483 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way

2075506 herceptin has revolutionized the care of her2 positive breast cancer for many patients but unfortunately not for some this work demonstrates that digging deeper into the molecular subtypes of these tumors helps us understand why some tumors are resistant and may point to ways to remedy that
2075507 our goal is to see what the tumor tells us before any treatment starts and tailor therapy accordingly
2075508 we were motivated to use navelbine because we found it has few side effects when used to treat metastatic breast cancer
2075509 this kind of profiling has been done to look at response to chemotherapy drugs but not at herceptin resistance
2075510 that tells us that the cancer cells are still creating her2 surface proteins even as herceptin is being used and that means her2 loss does not appear to be a mechanism of resistance in early stage breast cancer
2075511 activation of parallel pathways may release tumors from dependence on her2 proliferation and survival

2075596 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2075597 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2075598 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2075599 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2075600 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere

2075602 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2075603 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2075604 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2075605 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2075606 an appearance at the convention by edwards would only highlight the unresolved story
2075607 national enquirer scoop or not there appears to be way too much smoke here for the major mainstream media to continue ignoring the story about the out of wedlock child that john edwards may have fathered
2075608 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2075609 for the most part mainstream media outlets have not pursued the matter in part because edwards no longer is a presidential candidate nor does he hold a public office
2075610 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2075611 mr edwards is it true you were at the beverly hilton visting rielle hunter and your child on the night of july

2075628 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2075629 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city
2075630 at the time the jerusalem security barrier was built many israeli security experts pointed out that the wall was attaching 230 000 palestinians to israel and detaching them from the west bank in a way that was sure to spell trouble only in jerusalem has the barrier attached to a jewish city large numbers of palestinians everywhere else it is designed to separate jews and arabs its not too late to move the wall in jerusalem such an act could dovetail perfectly with a government of israel decision to recognize arab east jerusalem as the capital city of a palestinian state only in greater jerusalem does the barrier follow not security and demographic logic but rather ideology the claim of united jerusalem eternal capital of israel but jerusalem is not united and never has been um tuba has absolutely nothing to do with the capital of israel how many more desperate acts of senseless terror will be required for israelis and their leaders to tune into this reality

2075644 on the speaking circuits and via my blog i am often asked to critique marketing programs web sites and blogs my typical response whats the goal often throws people off it is amazing that so many marketers dont have established goals for their marketing programs and for web sites and blogs in particular

2075676 the vast majority of places where leaders get in trouble are sex money lies or some mixture
2075677 sex money and lies are where they always look this is where the press is looking and theyre good at it
2075678 you should not assume that some newspaper political opponent interest group u s attorney district attorney will treat you as fairly as you like to think you treat people you are looking at
2075679 how we get in trouble and how they try to get us in trouble
2075680 there are a good number of people who are well paid to make it look like we did something wrong even if we didnt
2075681 we categorize those as press political opponents in our own parties wannabees that want our job wannabees who know we are going to compete with them for the next job up the ladder and then of course you have the business that youre fighting with the businesses whose goals or agenda you are not supporting
2075682 we all know many in the public like to hear the thug of a fall from a high place
2075683 ultimately selling to the public and the public loves a disaster

2075699 while managers may know what to do to lead their people enthuse their staff use emotional intelligence and have the speed of trust for example many managers still dont know how to lead as well as they could
2075700 business managers must rise to the challenge and accept the responsibility to lead they can be good leaders even in these difficult times but this in turn depends on the availability of serious professional leadership training and coaching that deals with the critical interpersonal skills of overcoming resistance and building support

2075706 we have accomplished a lot of great things with chad including winning playoff games which is very hard to do he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2075707 i appreciate everything chad pennington has given to the jets organization
2075708 he was a part of my first draft as an owner in 2000 and has exemplified nothing but class both on and off the field i wish him robin luke and cole my very best
2075709 it also remains to be seen whether the decision to pay favre a whopping 12 million for what could be a one year rental creates further acrimony between the organization and guys like tight end chris baker who has been trying in vain to get the team to make good on a supposed promise to re do his deal
2075710 its certainly not surprising new jersey is in the top five or six but being number one and beating out new york takes some doing

2075720 santa ana now has a lot more buildings parking lots and streets which absorb and hold heat some of it through the night
2075721 the increase in temperatures in santa ana as well as an increase in extreme heat days and in heat waves is primarily about 60 percent due to the urban heat island effect
2075722 santa ana is embedded in the dramatic urbanization or extreme makeover of orange county more homes lawns shopping centers traffic freeways and agriculture all absorbing and retaining solar radiation making santa ana and orange county warmer

2075740 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2075741 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the european union and the organization for security and co operation in europe to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2075742 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2075743 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2075744 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2075745 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2075746 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2075747 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2075748 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2075749 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2075750 i am appalled that democrat lawmakers will not agree to these commonsense amendments
2075751 my son is currently serving in iraq to defend our state and nation from terrorists yet democrats will not do their part on the homefront to also defend us from such extremists
2075752 yet california democrats placed their radical political agenda ahead of citizens safety by refusing to prevent terrorists from teaching in our schools citizens should be outraged that these lawmakers are playing political games with our safety
2075753 would have required any person or organization seeking use of public school property to sign a statement of information declaring they do not advocate the overthrow of our government and are not part of an extremist terror network also any school employee discovered to be part of an extremist terror network could be fired
2075754 will allow communists to teach in public schools and use government property for their meetings
2075755 as we recognize the inherent danger in allowing communists those who seek the violent overthrow of our democratic republic access to the impressionable minds of young students
2075756 yet sb 1322 seeks to supersede the state constitution without voter approval and allow the government to employ individuals who want to destroy their employer
2075757 it really is shocking that at a time when america is still subject to attacks from radical terrorists and communist governments still terrorize their citizens california democrats wont stand up for us we have brave soldiers putting their lives on the line every day to defend us from such tyranny but democrats will not cast a simple vote to do the same here in california democrats are quick to side with the latest political cause championing the rights of the oppressed with their votes today democrats have missed their opportunity to make a statement denouncing oppressive communist governments responsible for the misery and suffering of so many worldwide
2075758 but the law also states that the property may not be used by anyone intent on overthrowing the government
2075759 sb 1322 would delete the requirement that an individual or organization wanting to use the school property is not a communist action organization or communist front organization

2075765 project managers face a high degree of risk when delivering a project
2075766 they have to complete a large number of tasks typically within a short period of time and with a limited number of resources using mpmm professional they can quickly create a step by step approach to delivering their projects from the outset this saves them time because they have a plan of attack that is based on best practices before they kick off their entire team know what the steps are that need to be taken to deliver the project successfully and the sponsor has a high degree of confidence that all of the right processes needed to manage the project are in place as a builder cant do without their toolbox a project manager cant do without their methodology toolkit

2075768 this is indeed a sad picture of the retail industry in the us mid tier retailers like shoe pavilion sharper image steve amp barrys and linens n things are all in danger of going bankrupt
2075769 but there is light at the end of the tunnel in the form of retailcrossing which aspires to list every possible active retail job opening in the industry there are many retail jobs out there but what is important is where you look for them
2075770 retailcrossing tries to leverage the quality of the existing retail job market with the help of quality efforts put in by hundreds of research analysts who scour jobs from every nook and cranny of the country
2075771 unlike other job boards that simply herd masses of job listings without looking back retailcrossing weeds out spam and jobs outside ones niche allowing job seekers to search efficiently and specifically

2075779 for china before a tv audience of 4 billion this was the luckiest moment in a thousand years it is too the start of something even bigger than an olympic games it is or at least is meant to be the beginning of chinas new era of greatness witnessed and implicitly approved by much of the leadership of the planet
2075780 friends who come from far how happy we are to have you here was the message of greeting to the world even the part of the world china has had harsh criticism from
2075781 and in a stroke it made the latest polemics about bushs words on human rights slide away
2075782 because in the run up it was often not the great sporting event that dominated the news flow but the political situation in the host nation
2075783 not the economic giant growing to threatening size but a nation with an ancient culture fascinating sounds and traditional pictures

2075812 rasmussen reports got the 2004 election right when everyone else got it wrong why would you mix results from a source that has been proven to be reliable with a source that has been proven to be unreliable
2075813 the fact is people are democrat when they are young because they dont have any real responsibility but they turn republican when they get older wiser start a family get a decent job own a home you know everything that comes with a life of responsibility thats fact
2075814 would you be questioning the methodology if obama were the candidate up by four probably not in my opinion
2075815 i have said this before and its still what i will view this entire election by rasmussen reports got the 2004 election right when everyone else got it wrong
2075816 18 to 29 year olds score much lower than those in other age groups on the current voting intention questions and that has been the case throughout the year
2075817 rasmusse nand other pollsters and the media want and need to drive interest they have changed their model and voter id recently to that end
2075818 even brit hume on fox news was stunned because all their polling data said it was going to be kerry all the way
2075819 banking your election chances on youth turnout something that is claimed will increase every year always disappointing is incredibly risky
2075820 if you would have told me a month ago that it would be mccain that would be running a tighter on message campaign with a media ad strategy that was blowing obama out i would have said you were crazy just goes to show you what having the right team in place does i do have to say that nobama has made a lot of unforced errors over the last month
2075821 if obama wins it will be a nail bitter not a blow out it will be by one or two states the same way bush won you need to get the fantasies of an obama landslide out of your heads
2075822 he wont have a six point lead hes going to have a 1 2 point lead or mccain will
2075823 but dont worry once we start following high tax high spending big government democrat economic policies you can see what a real recession is like
2075824 i already pay 65 of my income to the government obama thinks that isnt enough and wants to make it around 75 with increases on all those democrat taxes
2075825 the economy in 1980 was twenty times worse than it is now unemployment was in double digits inflation was around 20 interest rates were at 15 and there were not high gas prices there were gas lines
2075826 i already pay 65 of my income to the government
2075827 its not enough because the democrat congress and the republican congress under delay to be fair has been spending like drunken sailors one every do gooder feel good big government project that comes down the pike and obama just wants to increase it even more
2075828 bottom line is high taxes hurt the economy tax cuts makes the economy grow its simple even the liberal john kennedy understood that
2075829 obama wont veto nancy and harry and we will all be in really big trouble
2075830 mccains corporate tax cuts will grow the economy so the deficit will go down
2075831 i can start with raising the capital gains tax rate and the socialist security payroll tax cap that will send the economy into the shitter real fast
2075832 the 1960s 1980s and 1990s booms were all preceded by tax cuts which spurred innovation the kennedy tax cuts the reagan cuts and the clinton gingrich cuts to the capital gains rate in 1997 all led to a massive expansion
2075833 if obama raises the socialist security pay roll cap the capital gains rate lets the tax cuts expire and goes on a big government spending spree we are all going to have a lot less money
2075834 who do you trust to spend more adam the government spending other peoples money or people spending their own money
2075835 and obamas going to take some of it away because it shouldnt have been yours to begin with
2075836 its not enough because the democrat congress and the republican congress under delay to be fair has been spending like drunken sailors one every do gooder feel good big government project that comes down the pike
2075837 people making 200 000 and up who live in places like northern virginia or new york city arent buying private jets or yachts theyre trying to pay their mortgage car payments and their childrens college
2075838 oh and adam the goods the top 1 of the population are probably a good thing for the economy as a whole
2075839 vc you seem pretty knowledgeable so maybe you can tell me when were going to see those economic dividends from the bush tax cuts i feel ive been pretty patient
2075840 if hes so concerned about the deficit why doesnt obama come out for a balanced budget amendment mccain is for it
2075841 dont worry im sure barack nancy and harry will have me paying around 60 by the time its all over and probably still ask for more
2075842 well the vast majority of obamas tax increases involve people making over 2 87 million per year do you really qualify as such a person
2075843 if clinton hadnt raised taxes who says the economy wouldnt have grown even more
2075844 just making a comment that you cannot say that the sole reason for economic growth in the 1990s was clintons tax cuts it is not even certain to justifiy if they even contributed towards growth
2075845 the federal minimum wage is nothing more than another democrat program designed to make them look good to people that believe the u s should be a socialist country
2075846 the republicans would have been happy to pass the minimum wage had the democrats included tax breaks for small businesses in the deal you know the guys who are going to have to pay for that wage increase
2075847 if you are not with obama yet you will still not be with him in november hes peaked hes never closed the deal hes got nothing left to sell you on
2075848 do you have a problem with opinions that do not echo your own
2075849 though the question of course stands how do other lv models differ from the gallup model on which nate throws doubt in this post
2075850 i was around when carter was in office with his dem controlled congress and it was the worst time in my lifetime if the fed rate goes up into high double digits like it did under him i will lose everything you will only lose bragging rights so yes i am worried
2075851 i truly believe we could do a better job than all these people we have elected to do it for us
2075852 oh i reached my quota for your group i cant ask you any more questions
2075853 anyway you slice it obama will top out at 48 49 of the vote

2075892 we know we cant keep throwing rubbish into landfill my postbag is full of letters from people saying they want to recycle more but unless they know their efforts are making a real difference they wont keep trying thats why statistics like these are so important the figures published today are provisional we will know the full picture by the end of the year but the early results show those efforts continue to be worthwhile local authorities and their residents are making good progress we still have some way to go before we are performing at the level of some of our nearest neighbours in europe but we are catching them up and positive feedback like this should encourage all of us to keep up the effort to reduce and recycle our rubbish

2075917 there was no way of even finding all the current checklist projects without days of googling
2075918 as a result much of the great work thats going into developing community standards was being overlooked and different communities were at risk of developing mutually incompatible standards mibbi will help to prevent them from reinventing the wheel
2075919 communities working together through mibbi will produce non overlapping minimal information modules
2075920 the idea is that each checklist will fit neatly into a jigsaw with each community being able to take the pieces that are relevant to them
2075921 mibbi represents the first new effort taking the open biomedical ontologies obo as its role model
2075922 the mibbi portal operates in a manner analogous to obo as an open information resource while the mibbi foundry fosters collaborative development and integration of checklists into self contained modules just like the obo foundry does for the ontologies

2075928 even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years
2075929 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2075930 a good example is energy conservation and improved energy efficiency if you leave that to the market it is simply not going to happen or is going to happen very very slowly
2075931 well we said it was a trilogy so theres some stuff happening were also looking at some other post release content were working away biowares pretty busy these days
2075932 were talking about that you know how we are were always very circumspect until we can go aha there it is with everything we build now we want to have this long term relationship with the customer and always have something for them to try so were definitely looking at that for mass effect
2075933 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2075934 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2075935 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2075936 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2075937 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2075938 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
2075939 pass an all of the above comprehensive approach to energy
2075940 its not leadership when you let the american people suffer the way they are now
2075941 pelosi wants to save the planet but we need her to come here and save the american family the american taxpayer the middleclass and the poor
2075942 if nancy pelosi truly wanted to save the planet she would allow for american energy production
2075943 if you tell the american people the truth theyll do the right thing but we cant even talk about this
2075944 energy is the way we get out of poverty it is the great equalizer
2075945 relying on american creativity and ingenuity not the government is a real solution
2075946 we have the ability and creativity to solve our problems
2075947 muslim bashers play a six degrees of separation game of guilt by association with any muslim who dares to engage in positive social or political activism
2075948 in 2000 i agreed to serve as a member of the board of trustees of the dow jones islamic index fund i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
2075949 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
2075950 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now
2075951 baseless smears about a muslim with a very good reputation was used to marginalize not only him but the community from the political process
2075952 if someone like mr asbahi cant be vetted to work for the obama campaign then who can

2075965 gebed moet een belangrijkere plaats in gaan nemen in reformatorische hoek
2075966 het is van ondergeschikt belang tot welk kerkverband we horen
2075967 de kerk is veranderd door de samenleving in plaats van de samenleving door de kerk
2075968 de kerk hoort het geweten van de samenleving te zijn maar god geeft ons nog tijd om ons te bekeren
2075969 it showed all the solar panels on the rights of way in europe and you know the light went off and it was why dont we do that here
2075970 how we address the challenge of improving and diversifying our transportation infrastructure while reducing our overall carbon footprint will define who we are as a people as a state and i believe in the long time as a nation
2075971 if trucks spent more time in the evening or overnight hours moving goods and services they could probably be more efficient while you create a better opportunity for commuter traffic in the daylight hours to be efficient
2075972 you want to maximize the use of existing infrastructure and one of the great benefits of that is going to be a reduction in emissions
2075973 we have to get the country off the 700 billion a year it spends on foreign oil
2075974 its a killer and is going to cause our economy great problems
2075975 what im doing now im trying to do for the country
2075976 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
2075977 feeling is they have more in common than the elements that might separate their proposals
2075978 as soon as you open up the marketplace you are going to see an explosion in entrepreneurial activity
2075979 theres an emerging consensus that renewables which have been derided for so long as a pop gun when you need a cannon are showing signs of being able to contribute on a much larger scale than anyone has thought

2075982 i was always in hot water growing up and that was a bad thing back then now even though were in hot water thats always a good thing for us
2075983 what we do is we pump it out up on the hill and whats really nice about our campus is everything runs downhill and so we pump it it goes through our pipelines and each building gets the 192 degree water
2075984 and i guess oit owned some of this property here anyway and the president at the time winston purvine noticed that some places on the hill the snow melted faster up here and he said hmmm i wonder if theres geothermal up there he kinda noticed it was there and we moved the campus up here after we drilled the wells
2075985 i am kinda jealous you know its just one of those things when i get time
2075986 for the renewable energy program there is actually a geothermal course that they have to take when we get our power plant on campus too you can actually monitor it online
2075987 oregon and in particular this part of the state can be the saudi arabia of renewables all the sun and geothermal and wind were really well positioned to go gangbusters on renewables
2075988 its a great way to reach out to the community really quickly
2075989 its very two ways if youre strictly just posting things and not responding to people people wont be as quick to follow you once you build an audience and then have friends within twitter thats when it gets exciting

2076034 ill be goddamned if i let rob and ctc get away with that whos with me
2076035 lets face it just saying 8 8 08 sounds fun
2076036 i also think the 8 8 08 date looks nice on the wedding invitations
2076037 you usually can save 5 to 10 on the space by having a friday wedding
2076038 but the photographer officiant and everything else will still cost the same if its last minute youll be paying a premium for vendors any time you cancel youll incur costs
2076039 the average wedding costs 27 852 a 48 increase from 1999
2076040 for 8 8 08 some venues like hotels and resorts offered special package deals for destination weddings or honeymoons but in general theres a supply and demand dynamic for any significant date like this so be prepared to pay more and book your venue early
2076041 its only 13 months away so if you have a perfect reception venue in mind reserve it now to make sure you get it
2076042 keep in mind that 9 9 09 falls on a wednesday so that might not be the most convenient day for your guests
2076043 this is a cool wedding date but not because its 8 8 08
2076044 since this is 2008 and we use the entire number reduced 2008 is a 10 single digit 1 so the total of this marriage birth date is 8 8 1 26
2076045 2 6 8 two is the number of partnerships and six is the number of love which leads into the 8 which signifies balance
2076046 community newspapers are doing quite nicely thank you because they have not forgotten their mission their responsibility to their readers the service they must provide to their advertisers their duty to report the good and the bad to expose corrupt public servants who betray the public trust and seek to serve themselves first at the expense of the taxpayers
2076047 newspapers that do not change to meet the challenges of the times are the only ones which will die newspapers which exist only to make money will die
2076048 when you read a newspaper and find out you already knew 90 percent of the stuff on the front page what is the justification for buying the reading the newspaper newspapers must be meaningful to attract readers good newspapers are filled with fresh stories and information readily available in one package its better local stories better writing better editing and better graphics in short its what people want to know packaged in a creative way and yes its the good packaged with the bad

2076112 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2076113 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city
2076114 while evidence of a close family relationship can support a favorable finding to impose an informal fiduciary duty the evidence that greg and david had such a close relationship to allow a court to impose an informal fiduciary duty was a disputed fact
2076115 david had various individuals either employed by him or officing with him involved in the preparation of documentation necessary for trading or selling shells
2076116 david continued to advise greg and lisa that they were legally prohibited from selling or otherwise trading any of their shares of stock
2076117 in many ways the plaintiffs failure to act on his own behalf was the proximate cause of his own fate
2076118 at all times plaintiffs were entitled to take action on behalf of themselves and their own interests
2076119 david using his knowledge and training in the law and experience acquired through years of trading and selling shells identified the opportunity and purposefully sought the confidence of plaintiffs to utilize the assets of con tex even if it be for mutual gain
2076120 the record is replete with incidents where david would have documents prepared and faxed to greg for his signature without greg having any understanding of what he was signing

2076173 unlicensed drivers including illegal aliens are not eligible for auto insurance and pose a significant danger to the people of the city and county of denver when driving and must be prohibited from doing so in every way possible
2076174 illegal aliens do bother me because they come across the border they affect our supply and demand they overrun our schools they do everything that i am against they are impacting us
2076175 i dont see how any good democrat can support illegal immigration and call themselves an environmentalist one of the things we need to do is start controlling population

2076177 we have 19 ordinances in our city that give the police the authority to impound vehicles

2076209 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
2076210 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2076211 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
2076212 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
2076213 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
2076214 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2076215 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2076216 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
2076217 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese

2076225 personal income in the columbus area grew 5 5 percent last year a number that was the best in ohio but still below the national average
2076226 economic conditions are declining rapidly leaving the country with some of the lowest incomes and highest prices in the region and an extreme vulnerability to high inflation
2076227 according to indicators such as from transparency international syria is now the fourth most corrupt country in the world al assad arrived promising economic reforms but this dictatorship has found it impossible to answer societys problems with anything other than violence this corrodes the moral fabric of the nation fundamentally this is still minority alawi rule over the majority and this cannot last
2076228 he can see that the democratic forces in this country have finally started to broaden their horizons are learning from anti dictatorial movements that have toppled regimes across the world primarily looking at the eastern european experience
2076229 the slope of improvement is now there even if it is minimal as we begin to tackle the serious problems of mobilization information and undermining the system
2076230 syria is not an alawite state as many have argued
2076231 the al assad family is alawite and there is an overrepresentation of them at the top of the system but most members of the government and even security establishment are actually sunni
2076232 george bush legitimized dictatorship across the middle east by the iraq war disaster
2076233 most syrians have now come to a grudging acceptance that assad represents a known and for the most part non lethal status quo bashars future politically looks very bright he has managed to neutralize most rivals the opposition is minimal and a great propaganda effort to get everyone onboard has taken place
2076234 the imf and the world bank estimate inflation is running at between 16 percent to 18 percent in a society with a large proportion of people on fixed state incomes those in liberal professions are ok but its the ones who actually work for the state who are in trouble
2076235 the main battles being fought inside damascus are over economic liberalization and how far to take the process
2076236 one of the main problems this opening up might lead to is for younger members of the syrian elite who have no managed to accrue vast wealth through corrupt or extensive patronage networks might become angry that they have missed out
2076237 in 2008 syria became a net importer of petrol for the first time in decades during a major oil shock he has been left will little choice but to update his economic framework this explains his movements westward as economics drives the politics
2076238 in answering the question of how strong or weak is bashar assad my answer is that he is as strong as former romanian dictator nicolai ceausescu when he met queen elizabeth ii on a state visit in the early 80s
2076239 syria will like an authoritarian state never have small problems it will either collapse utterly or continue that is the paradox of such a state structure they are both as strong as they appear and as weak as they fear

2076241 the uk does remain subject to high levels of covert non military activity by foreign intelligence organisations
2076242 they are increasingly combining traditional intelligence methods with new and sophisticated technical attacks for example attempting to penetrate computer networks through the internet
2076243 it systems in government departments and various organisations including elements of the national infrastructure have been and continue to be attacked to obtain the sensitive information they hold
2076244 some of these attacks are well planned and well executed

2076270 cuatro familias que viv an en ellas han sido expulsadas al limbo sin que ning n miembro de la comisi n de integraci n hubiese informado
2076271 la confusi n y la irritaci n se mezclan por igual entre los habitantes del poblado de penamoa con algunas construcciones ya destruidas por las excavadoras y algunos de ellos ya en sus nuevas viviendas otros afirman que se ven obligados a vivir en unas barracas nuevas durante por lo menos tres meses la concejala de servicios sociales silvia longueira pas ayer por el lugar en compa a de varios polic as locales y algunos asistentes sociales para pedir m s paciencia a los que a n no tienen casa y asegurarles que las cosas est n en marcha sin embargo cuando se march los nimos segu an crispados y algunos hablaban de recurrir a los abogados para asegurarse de que se respetar n sus derechos

2076277 el hecho de que a algunos se les concedan pisos y a otros no ha causado resentimiento entre la poblaci n que da signos de divisi n ante lo que consideran un trato desigual
2076278 me hicieron firmar un papel y me tiraron la casa me iban a dar un piso y ahora me dicen que me lo est n mirando
2076279 mientras tanto dudan hasta de si sus nuevas viviendas provisionales ser n mejores que las chabolas en las que han vivido hasta ahora

2076290 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2076291 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years us taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
2076292 pinning the failure of reconstruction and the poor functioning of the iraqi government on the iraqi government is obscene
2076293 it is politically expedient and an obscene rewriting of history to say that the us should not be giving the iraqis any more money for reconstruction because the iraqis have plenty of money of their own
2076294 the us gave the reconstruction money to us corporations the corporations took the money and failed to do the reconstruction
2076295 the iraqis are essentially doing fine on their own running their oil industry they are making money and increasing production and exports because oil is so expensive iraqis will have the money to invest and rebuild their oil infrastructure without investment from us oil companies

2076298 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
2076299 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
2076300 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
2076301 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
2076302 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
2076303 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
2076304 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
2076305 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
2076306 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
2076307 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
2076308 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
2076309 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
2076310 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
2076311 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
2076312 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
2076313 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
2076314 we wanted to put our best foot forward we considered what we are the first thing people see when they get here and last thing when they leave so we wanted to make a good impression

2076340 it has been likened to rotting onions unwashed socks and even carrion in custard but the most accurate description by far is that of a sewer full of rotting pineapples

2076346 it also surpasses the carbon yields of glucose and sucrose fermentation furanics could be established as both the automotive energy source and chemical starting material of the future

2076350 there are 3 more of those little grey things in holding on the karama
2076351 when were you going to tell us that little bit of information
2076352 i would personally advise that if they were to proceed at least at this stage to allay fears of others have a closed door forum deal with it then engage with the rest particularly those who have expressed concerns
2076353 my position has always been that you should always have an open attitude in giving democratic space
2076354 but there are now sensitivities raised so whether it is effective if you have an open forum and seen to be too provocative or have a more closed door affair so discussions can take place without being seen as too provocative
2076355 yes i was criticised asking why it was necessary but i said at least it allowed people to express themselves and allay fears anxieties and insecurities that religious beliefs are being maligned
2076356 i may not share that view but there is a concern expressed and people are genuinely worried i think for the sake of a multiracial and religious malaysia we should be mindful of this continue discussions engage with those who are concerned allay the fears and move on
2076357 i think this strategy would be more effective in the medium and long term when going head on with an issue which is particularly sensitive

2076365 cellular fountain of youth or a small molecule which enables human cells to avoid aging and dying
2076366 all cells face an inevitable death as they age on this path cells became lethargic and in the end stop dividing but we witnessed that cgk733 can block the process kim said
2076367 we also found the synthetic compound can reverse aging by revitalizing already lethargic cells theoretically this can give youth to the elderly via rejuvenating cells the 41 year old said
2076368 obviously it is an innovative finding but we need to see whether or not cgk733 could really rejuvenate cells inside human bodies without generating side effects prof kim sung hoon at seoul national university said
2076369 we have the magnet associated technology to identify molecular targets inside living cells which allowed us to examine the mechanisms of cgk733 directly kim said
2076370 unlike other research teams that must make candidates materials for drugs without being able to see their intra cell activities we know the precise mechanism of cgk733 so we have the better chance of making a success of the substance he continued
2076371 magic is kind of a source technology to see inside cells based on the method we also found a pair of promising substances that can deal with cancers kim said

2076389 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2076390 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

2076420 it was clear that the tax code is encouraging speculators to bid up the price of oil
2076421 in order for the holding and price manipulation to affect the worldwide oil price the manipulator and holder has to be really really big
2076422 i doubt that there is someone out there who is big enough to manipulate the price like that

2076426 that importantly does not mean you cant eat fish we think fish is an important part of the diet and you can actually get the benefits of fish without the risk by choosing low mercury fish
2076427 you must eat fish to be healthy but not too much or you will harm your children
2076428 companies have not been totally jumping up and down saying yes yes well do it
2076429 it took two years to get them costco to agree to do it what were seeing is an increasing trend its becoming an industry standard
2076430 we spend a lot of time on risk avoidance to stop people from eating fish
2076431 we really need to be preventing mercury contamination in the first place and cleaning it up

2076439 we especially applaud them rendering such a critical decision on such a short timeline this will allow the states solar industry to blossom
2076440 we appreciate the puc giving all of us the quick legal clarity that was necessary to continue to promote solar power throughout oregon while protecting our customers and all energy consumers
2076441 we have a number of public private solar power partnerships that will continue moving forward and well be announcing some grants for new solar projects and other renewables in the very near term
2076442 the pucs decision is a victory for solar power in oregon a victory for the earth and a victory for renewable energy as a cornerstone of oregons future economic prosperity
2076443 i commend the puc for their decision and thank them for acting quickly enough to avoid harming the large number of solar projects currently in the pipeline

2076464 oh it isnt that bad i can get through it
2076465 i love the color and i just wanted to wear something summery something that had a nice old hollywood feel
2076466 i once new somebody who met a girl who was friends with a guy who was thrown clear of a terrible crash and survived because he was not wearing his seatbelt
2076467 first of all i believe we were only just short last year we only lost three premier league games
2076468 we have kept the basis of the team and the frustration we got from not winning in the end will come out for the good we need to show strength and resolve but we have that
2076469 weve lost gilberto who was very experienced and important in the dressing room and weve lost hleb who weve replaced with nasri but we have many young players who are one year older and have learned we made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and we want to continue if we get into the same position again in march then i believe we will show the needed resilience
2076470 william has acknowledged that he made some mistakes and he has learnt from them
2076471 he is an important player and he plays in a position where it is easy to be the captain some of the other players who could be captain are still a bit young i believe at the moment that kolo will be his assistant
2076472 william got a lot of criticism after what happened at birmingham but until then everyone said he was a fantastic captain so i think he deserves another go to show his commitment and then well see where we stand at the end of the season
2076473 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2076474 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said

2076476 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires

2076485 we need to make the entity that is in the best position to mitigate the risk to be responsible for that risk
2076486 and that means making the financial institutions and companies who hold the data liable for fraudulent transactions this will result in a lot more prosecutions and a much safer environment these prosecutions in the u s are just the tip of the iceberg and more needs to be done
2076487 the charging of the individuals involved with the retail id theft is great news for business however it is also bad news why because this basic problem should not have happened it is irrelevant whether the charged individuals gained access via the wireless network or any other method it was a failure of the organizations involved to implement basic controls and then maintain and monitor them

2076544 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2076545 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2076546 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2076547 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits

2076635 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2076636 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2076637 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2076638 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2076639 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2076640 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from

2076653 a cabinet established through such an avenue will lack moral credibility parliament itself will be tarnished both the executive and the legislature two vital arms of governance will be perceived by the people as institutions that are bereft of integrity
2076654 the size and scale of the crossover he envisages is mind boggling has there ever been an instance anywhere in the world where a government which has 58 seats more than the combined opposition is under the constant threat of imminent collapse simply because an individual who is not even in parliament boasts continuously that a certain number of mps are going to switch sides by a certain date
2076655 if the threat of crossovers hangs like a sword of damocles over the nations head it is partly because many malaysians know that anwar as a bn and federal government leader at one time had played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the democratically elected pbs state government in sabah in 1994
2076656 in a democracy a legislator elected on a particular platform should return his mandate to the people and resign his seat before he switches sides that is what respect for the dignity of the voter means
2076657 they should have tried to convince him that it is more honourable to enter putrajaya through the front door this implies winning the 13th general election at the federal level and forming the government through legitimate ethical means
2076658 one hopes that he will also as the leader of the opposition establish a shadow cabinet that cajoles and coaxes the bn government to introduce much needed changes

2076800 re hrbs bill yasnoff leaves a few important details out of his post on hrbs first he neglects to point out that hes applied for a patent on the idea of health record banks second while bill says that several states are working towards this model he also neglects to point out that hes involved in all of these initiatives and that the states did so on the advice of his consulting firm the reality is the hrb model has a lot of problems there are huge bootstrap issues providers wont invest in the interfaces needed with hrbs until there are lots of patients who have them and patients wont pay to play until providers are set up to provide info indeed it appears that bill has backed off his initial hrb plan that patients would play a monthly fee and providers would be paid for each deposit to the hrb to present bill has relied on grant funding its quite unclear that the model is sustainable particularly with the new dependence on advertising reminders and researchers paying for data
2076801 re hrbs non profits dont have to hire a for profit company to run it there is no reason the non profit cant do it themselves or hire a non for profit to operate it alternative models to advertising could also be other sources such as employer funded or state grants an alternative to paying the docs for data could be pushing the emerging trend of malpractice insurers providing discounts to docs that use an emr to reduce their risk profile that same logic is even more relevant for care history provided by a hrb to address the our chronic discontinuity of care across setting and info silos we cant get it right within an info silo so across silos is a huge opportunity to address high risk ball dropping areas

2076878 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
2076879 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then

2076889 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2076890 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

2076907 since then we know what it is to fear the lord we try to persuade men what we are is plain to god and i hope it is also plain to your conscience
2076908 god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them
2076909 and i hope it is also plain to your conscience
2076910 since then we know what it is to fear the lord we try to persuade men
2076911 since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and soul perfecting holiness out of reverence for god

2076918 if you think about the midwest think about right here what weve got is all kind of towns that we could connect
2076919 all of these cities are they basically take in the air about 45 minutes to an hour to fly
2076920 take off your shoes get to the terminal realize that your flights been delayed two hours go pay 10 for a cup of coffee and a sandwich for another 10 come back you get on the plane youre sitting on the tarmac for another 25 minutes you finally take off youre circling above the city for another half hour when you land they cant find your luggage and then you get to where youre going by the time its all done its a five hour trip so the time is right now for us to start thinking about high speed rail as an alternative to air transportation connecting all these cities and think about what a great project that would be in terms of rebuilding america

2076977 the quran narrates in surah al kahf the cave the story of some pious youths who took refuge in a cave these people had a dog with them and the fact that allah mentions the dog and counts the dog among them indicates that dogs are permitted to live among people

2077003 this was really arrogant group violence and the result is totally unacceptable
2077004 it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
2077005 life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken

2077106 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2077107 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2077108 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2077109 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2077110 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2077111 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly

2077120 the government said that 16 government commercial and university labs had the strain of anthrax with the same genetic mutations as the anthrax used in the attacks and even at fort detrick the government said that more than 100 people had access to the flask creating a lot of room for reasonable doubt

2077124 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe

2077126 no one wants to see a household lose their home and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well
2077127 one year into the credit crunch the number of people being repossessed is rapidly rising with these figures showing the biggest increase in a half year period since 1996
2077128 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2077129 we know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2077130 they should not think that every time there is a problem there is going to be a spiral of bad debt and that they are never going to be able to get their money back
2077131 no one is selling unless they have to because they will get a discounted rate so it seems better to me to hang on and defer your payments
2077132 rising mortgage and other living costs are behind the increase in repossessions as people struggle to pay the bills the situation is likely to get worse with rising food fuel and mortgage costs as borrowers come off relatively cheap two year fixed rates and remortgage onto more expensive deals or onto their lenders standard variable rate until pricing comes down

2077200 the governor himself told a national television audience that flip flopping is a great thing that it is a wonderful thing when someone has made a mistake and is able to be honest about it and change his mind
2077201 keeping a viable high speed rail bond off the ballot at this critical juncture after decades of laying the groundwork for a system that will move this state forward would be a huge mistake the only thing remaining to be seen is whether the governor will recognize and acknowledge that fact before it is too late to correct
2077202 if mccain can win michigan he is likely to win the election
2077203 as ive elucidated before having gone this far in florida it would be premature for the obama campaign to pull out now by any measure its a winnable state

2077207 states like florida missouri and indiana represent break glass in case of emergency states for obama mccains analogous states are probably pennsylvania oregon and perhaps minnesota
2077208 if obama can hold michigan it looks really grim for mccain michigan would take obama to 260 virginia winner indiana winner colorado and nevada winner
2077209 btw if mccain does pour money into oregon its no more stupid than obama pouring money into north carolina or georgia

2077299 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2

2077313 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2077314 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2077315 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2077316 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2077317 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2077318 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2077319 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2077320 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2077321 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment

2077330 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2077331 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2077332 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2077333 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis

2077396 development began in november 1998 and it was ready for launching three years later the cost was only about 100 million for comparison that is only one thousandth the cost of the international space station which serves no useful purpose

2077407 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2077408 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

2077468 these data add a new twist to the association and suggest that periodontal disease may be there before diabetes
2077469 we found that over two decades of follow up individuals who had periodontal disease were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life when compared to individuals without periodontal disease
2077470 what diabetes care doesn t mention is that periodontal disease simply didn t occur in pre agricultural man
2077471 oooh six years well lets measure your gums and see whats going on
2077472 notably in the diabetes study participants with gum disease who had lost all of their teeth appeared to be at lower risk for diabetes

2077502 el fabricante canadiense tiene m ltiples planes en movimiento para contrarrestar el momentum de apple entre los consumidores incluyendo un nuevo producto ya anunciado el bold y otros dos posibles el thunder y el kickstart

2077516 ryanair has made it very obvious that they dont want the travel trade selling on their fares
2077517 it really makes its money from other things it sells through its own website ryanair owner michael oleary has had a bee in his bonnet about third parties making money from his business
2077518 refunding the fares is only part of the problem peoples holiday arrangements would be ruined they would also lose money they had paid for arrangements they made on the ground
2077519 we are stunned that ryanair is treating its customers in this way
2077520 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel in the way that is convenient for them not making it even harder
2077521 we are really shocked that ryanair are doing this even though passengers could seek compensation from whoever sold them the ticket it is hardly going to make things easy when they turn up at the airport
2077522 ryanair should be taking this up with the people who they claim are using the website illegally rather than people who booked the tickets in good faith
2077523 ryanair doesnt want people booking through screenscrapers is they cant sell passenger the stuff that comes with the flight like hotels car hire and insurance
2077524 we will sell tickets through third party sites but we charge a 7 5 euro 5 94 booking fee to cover the lost business opportunities

2077733 it gives an editor the ability to create a little more dynamic inline linking it lets an editor select things and pull up other multimedia oriented resources to define that term a little bit deeper
2077734 they are increasingly providing smart tools to semantically link in the things that you are interested in that technology is fairly immature at this point but it can go farther whats important for now is the tool lets you link to things in an interesting way
2077735 i think another thing thats really interesting and taking off in drupal is more content exchange technologies
2077736 part of the semantic web concept is obviously linking disparate pieces of information together from a pure content management system perspective thats great but it needs to be coupled with the fact that people just want to be able to borrow content from each other we dont make huge distinctions anymore about what site is serving content content exchange as a theme interplays very nicely with semantic web technologies
2077737 played a key role in negotiating a multi billion dollar increase in gse affordable housing goals
2077738 we know that the mba has a lot of pull with andrew cuomo and we tried to convince them to back off mba said they are fully committed to hud
2077739 what youre seeing is fannie and freddie flexing their muscle
2077740 they have more money than god and they use it
2077741 no one ever criticized cuomo for not taking on the fight at hud
2077742 mortgage bankers thought cuomo was the toughest secretary they had ever known
2077743 balked on banning the practice whereby brokers maximize their commissions by signing up borrowers for the most expensive loan possible even when the borrower qualifies for a cheaper
2077744 more concerned with getting the highest ysp possible than getting their borrowers the best loan possible
2077745 too often consumers think the brokers are working for them in reality they are working against them
2077746 to discourage practices that give financial incentives to mortgage brokers that offer higher priced loans than what are generally available in the marketplace
2077747 hud does not view the name of the payment as the appropriate issue
2077748 you may wish to ask about the fees that the mortgage broker will receive for its services
2077749 is disclosure of the fact that the borrower finances the cost of ysps through higher monthly mortgage payments
2077750 a rule should require that mortgage brokers inform borrowers of the role that they are serving early enough in the transaction to allow the consumer to shop for alternatives
2077751 this statement does not mandate disclosures beyond those currently required
2077752 we believe that there are a lot of loans to black americans that could be safely purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac if these companies were more flexible
2077753 we have not been a major presence in the subprime market
2077754 but you can bet that under these goals we will be
2077755 gse presence in the subprime market could be of significant benefit to lower income families minorities and families living in underserved areas
2077756 in moving even tentatively into this new area of lending fannie mae is taking on significantly more risk which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times but
2077757 the government subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s
2077758 partly in response to higher affordable housing goals set by hud in 2000
2077759 the increased goals created tension in its business practices between meeting the goals and conducting responsible lending practices
2077760 hud is not establishing any requirements for additional data to carry out this rule
2077761 does not provide the details for effective monitoring of their subprime activity
2077762 dear come and rescue me come fast i am in danger
2077763 i guess weekly forecast grab the pepto bismol were going to have some fun

2077767 a lot of people in my realm see the two stolen elections of 2000 and 2004 as being a problem
2077768 the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives

2077778 penso che sia una delle persone pi intelligenti e colte che io conosca
2077779 si schermisce molto dice che capisce un po di teologia ma quando il presidente della repubblica giorgio napolitano gli ha offerto un concerto di brahms in vaticano lui alla fine dopo aver ringraziato ha fatto la storia musicale di brahms nel caso che qualcuno dei presenti non sapesse chi era questo compositore
2077780 abbiamo deciso di partecipare ai giochi e di inviare in occasione della cerimonia di apertura un rappresentante autorevole del governo come il ministro degli esteri
2077781 i really had no desire to be in politics prior to last year
2077782 nine years ago when i first began visiting congress with the academy of ophthalmology advocating and addressing health care issues i had a wonderful rapport and relationship with the honorable former congressman jim leach i thought leach was an ideal representative for our district he was very thoughtful he was introspective he was highly intelligent he would dissect bills and issues and then give you a response now he may not have always given the response that you wanted but at least you were assured that there was insight and a true understanding of the difficulties and different sides of an issue i always felt that he was doing what was best for the district and for the constituents within the boundaries of the constitution
2077783 i didnt have a sense that there was an understanding for the voters problems or a sense of knowledge of the issues the thing that i believe makes a good representative and provides thoughtful insight into regulations and laws
2077784 one of the very effective things about my candidacy is the fact that i am a small business owner that i am a woman that im a mother that im a wife of almost 25 years that im a veteran that i was a nurse and the fact that i left home at 16 and paid my own way through college all of these combination of things are so very different in and of themselves yet they make a complete package that is a microcosm of our entire society and our entire district
2077785 one is always cognizant of the fact of being a role model for those that will hopefully come behind
2077786 i try to always present myself as i am to be authentic and sincere im caring but also intelligent and knowledgable on the issues voters want someone who is credible and competent and capable and then if you have those additional attributes that women bring to the table thats icing on the cake
2077787 i believe there is a difference between men and woman although i also realize that there is crossover
2077788 i think women tend to be more receptive of other viewpoints women listen carefully build consensus and are good at collaborating they have knack for bringing different groups of people into the fold so to speak
2077789 i think that having the experience of working around men in a position of authority and being able to be respectful dignified and commanding but doing so in a manner that doesnt leave anyone feeling inadequate or less significant is important
2077790 so yes i think that my having been in the military when there were very few women starting medical school when there were very few women being the first woman faculty member at the university of iowa and being the first female president of the iowa medical society positions me well to work with different groups of people to collaborate well and to interact well and make everybody feel that they are a necessary component to the entire puzzle

2077875 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe and the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel
2077876 i think this research does to some extent call some of those assumptions into question
2077877 it certainly shows that stepfathers or even unmarried social fathers can be quite productive in rearing children
2077878 stepfathers have to work harder to fit in and to have a useful productive role
2077879 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2077880 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2077881 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2077882 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2077883 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds

2077888 what would everyone be saying if the suspected rapist was described as black or horrors white
2077889 problem is most nowadays are commited by illegal aliens from south of the border it happens on a weekly basis also cultural differences make it much more of an issue rape south of the border is more common and less of a crime also age of consent or non consent for that matter since consent means little down there is 12 women are more or less objects down there from what ive read and heard sex seems to be a mans right whether or not theres consent rapists who are born and raised in america know its deviant or theyre psychotic and studies have shown its more about the violence and power then the sex with the rapists weve imported from south of the border its a case of un checked desire and their right to take it from you as a man
2077890 rapists who are born and raised in american know its deviant or theyre psychotic
2077891 elena its clear that mando cannot be shown to understand the problems that almost all americans have with obvious racism particularly when it involves politics
2077892 you are saying that most rape is commited by illegal aliens from latin american countries
2077893 you are also saying that rape has a different genesis in latin american countries than it does in our country
2077894 mando why do you call it an allegation you are a racist if you believe anything youve posted today
2077895 you are aware that your definition of machismo is not the one recognized by most people who har that word
2077896 mando you need to provide documentation if you are going to make unsubstantiated allegations without providing us with the data otherwise those of us who know better are just going to think you are blowing smoke do you think you would find your statistics true in washington dc seattle wa bangor maine

2077912 theology in a postcolonial context is a highly political affair postcolonial theologies will not settle for a position at the margins of their western counterparts rather they serreptitiously seek to turn the margin into the centre thereby disrupting the serenity grounded on the assumption that western formulations are self evident

2077930 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2077931 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2077932 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
2077933 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
2077934 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts
2077935 today epa has denied a request submitted by the state of texas to reduce the nationwide renewable fuels standard
2077936 as a result the required total volume of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel mandated by law to be blended into the fuel supply will remain at nine billion gallons in 2008 and 11 1 billion gallons in 2009
2077937 implementation of the rfs would have no significant impact in the relevant time frame the 2008 2009 corn season and the most likely result is that a waiver would have no impact on ethanol production volumes in the relevant time frame and therefore no impact on corn food or fuel prices

2078076 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following

2078088 the idols of the tribe are inherent in human nature and the very tribe or race of man for mans sense is falsely asserted to be the standard of things they arise either from the uniformity of the constitution of mans spirit or its prejudices or its limited faculties or restless agitations or from the interference of the passions or the incompetence of the senses
2078089 the idols of the den are those of each individual for everybody in addition to the common errors in the race of man has his own individual den or cavern which intercepts or corrupts the light of nature either from his own peculiar and singular disposition or from his education and intercourse with others or from his reading and thre authority acquired by those whom he reverences and admires or from the different impressions produced on the mind as it happens to be preoccupied and predisposed

2078215 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2078216 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population

2078233 celebrity endorsements of politicians really dont mean much having campaigned for al gore and for john kerry i think that the only job that an entertainer may have is to attract media or attract people to a speaking engagement for said politician
2078234 i dont think celebrities impact people and nor should they
2078235 i have my political views but i dont think its important to share

2078256 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2078257 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2078258 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory

2078267 the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways

2078269 renewable biofuels are one of the most important tools we have to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

2078279 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2078280 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

2078307 investigations into these cases have been running slow if not totally nil to the utter dismay of the victims families and the public to date despite the obvious trends and patterns that criminal investigations can deduce from given the daily occurrence of these killings we have yet to see a single credible arrest and prosecution of the real perpetrators
2078308 extrajudicial or summary killings whether political or non political are on a rampage in davao city and in other parts of southern mindanao the brazenness by which these killings were perpetrated only manifests a clear breakdown of law and order as the perpetrators the so called death squads seem to pride themselves as being beyond the reach of the law day by day these murderous motorcycle riding assassins are becoming bolder and bolder
2078309 not only is the value of human lives lost in these places the failure of the authorities to have these cases effectively investigated and solved has also lost the meaning of protection as an utmost responsibility of the state
2078310 extrajudicial or summary killings whether political or non political are on a rampage in davao city and in other parts of southern mindanao

2078343 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2078344 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2078345 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001

2078375 but about a year ago we decided that we wanted to try something different we have a couple of people on our staff who are really good at sniffing out excellent prices and a light bulb went off when we realized that the best prices we were showing on our sites which were provided to us by an aggregation service were never the best prices you could get
2078376 so we came up with the concept for beatthat which would have a fixed inventory of products and would always have the best prices for those products
2078377 we didnt want to rely on the merchants to tell us when the price is good
2078378 we wanted to rely on the literal wisdom of the crowd and if you have a large enough crowd looking for the best deals you are going to find them
2078379 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at barack obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future says rick husong owner of the loyalty inc
2078380 a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama

2078385 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
2078386 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

2078396 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2078397 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2078398 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2078399 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2078400 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2078401 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways

2078428 truly trying to see what their child would be interested in
2078429 dont force the child to stay at the activity if he or she hates it
2078430 parents need to have conversations with their kids about the fact that when they first start something its going to take some time to get good at it
2078431 signs like continued reluctance to go to the extracurricular activity their child is probably engaged in too many things so they need to scale back

2078566 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2078567 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2078568 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

2078590 evan tarkovskys is a student film that is very faithful to the hemingway story which ends with the swede being told the men are in town in the short story we dont get to the killing neither the 1946 or the 1964 versions are anywhere near faithful to the short story the tarkovsky film actually it was co directed by tarkovsky is a student film with crappy acting and production values and its e hard for me to find anything in it that speaks to his future promise my review of the dvd see the url quoted above and in the piece actually has some more info the 1964 version was made to be the first tv movie ever it was deemed too violent by the network therefore it has a real 60s television universal city vibe the pick of the litter is the 1946 noir
2078591 i am sorry joseph but your review does do this major film justice

2078619 me and coach crean had a good relationship when he was at marquette he talked to me about things other than basketball and we built a good relationship he moved to indiana and he called me and said nothings going to change because he moved to indiana thats what made me make my decision
2078620 i havent been to bloomington yet but hopefully i can get there in early september when i start my senior year
2078621 i know a couple of players that are going there and its close to home my parents can see a couple of my games thats the school that will put me in the best situation
2078622 it was fun i think i played really really well in vegas unfortunately we didnt win the whole thing but it happens i didnt play much in the spring and i just wanted to prove myself i felt like i played well in vegas

2078630 the data were very clear showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin d increased
2078631 the serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2 000 international units of vitamin d3 daily plus when the weather permits spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun
2078632 through this meta analysis we found that raising the serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin d to 34 ng ml would reduce the incidence rates of colorectal cancer by half
2078633 we project a two thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng ml which corresponds to a daily intake of 2 000 iu of vitamin d3 this would be best achieved with a combination of diet supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun
2078634 meta analysis is an important tool for revealing trends that may not be apparent in a single study
2078635 pooling of independent but similar studies increases precision and therefore the confidence level of the findings
2078636 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2078637 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black source
2078638 are the knicks really the worst team in the conference

2078641 thats kind of what i have control over i wish i was faster like spence but i like getting in there and getting dirty and making the good catch over the middle
2078642 its more than a dream i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
2078643 if im going good enough to be what i think i can be a starter in this league its going to happen by me going out and playing ball
2078644 the ceasefire committee received an official communication from the milf leadership a directive coming from sammy gambar the chief of staff of the bangsamoro islamic armed forces which is the armed component of the milf categorically calling their forces to reposition and withdraw from these barangays since that announcement at 6 o clock in the morning up to the present there had already been active withdrawal from the area
2078645 even before the announcement early this morning a 6 o clock in the evening of last night about 60 to 70 armed elements of the milf had also started to move out from these barangays and had returned to their places of origins
2078646 the campaign ad in which you proposed a solution to the oil crisis i thought it was hilarious
2078647 i saw the video you made the campaign ad in which you made fun of john mccains ad in which he compared barack obama to you and britney you know the funny or die video where you surprised everyone with a really solid understanding of our nations dependence on foreign oil and the environmental and geo political ramifications of dragging our feet towards a solution
2078648 what do you think of this years presidential election i feel like no matter what party you belong to there is a real sense of opportunity in the country not only to move out from under the dark legacy of our current president but to present a new vision of americas future barack obama is an extraordinarily charismatic candidate who invigorates his supporters in ways that havent been seen since jfk or the first bill clinton nomination battle while john mccain represents an alternative spokesman for the republican party who has often marched to the beat of his own drummer in opposition to his party representing an independent thinker if both of these expert politicians limit their base pandering inclinations and run their campaigns on the promise of political rejuvination it seems to me that its impossible not to be excited and enthusiastic about the prospects of this historic election
2078649 its just such a relief to have someone to bounce ideas around without having to make mindless small talk
2078650 and be honest dont you think theres something kind of played out in taking someone whos publicly considered stupid and giving them some scripted lines to surprise everyone with a depiction of them as being smart like i know that you came up with those ideas about environmentally protected offshore drilling as a temporary hold over until detroit can develop new hybrid technologies on your own but you have to admit that the presentation of the ad the joke of it if you will was that youre a fucking idiot and everyone knows it and so its weird to hear complete sentences come out of your mouth you know and i just think that comedic trope is kind of played out not that it was ever that funny to begin with granted its probably not any more played out or unfunny than jokes about you being as stupid as people assume that you are or having aids or whatever but still thoughts
2078651 for the next two and a half weeks almost all youll hear in the news will be related to the 29th olympiad in beijing
2078652 beyond this in 2010 we will see the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
2078653 china has been gearing up for the games for the past few years finally with a dozen new sports stadiums and a cross city underground railway to ferry visitors to different venues china will be on display to the world
2078654 if youve been investing internationally youre no stranger to china depending on when you bought you may either love it or hate it for instance in 2007 chinese stocks rocketed up the charts 97
2078655 in 2006 the gains were even more impressive at 130 but it hasnt been all fun and games in the past two years china peaked at the same time u s stocks in october 2007
2078656 since then their indexes have dropped substantially nearly 40 much more than the s amp p 500 investors in chinese equities have taken a bath over the last year but that doesnt mean its over for asian giant so why is it time to consider china again
2078657 for one the olympics will showcase china to the world in the next 18 days the middle kingdom will host more visitors in its cities than at any time in history
2078658 half a million wealthy attendees from all over the globe will descend upon beijing shanghai qinhuangdao shenyang tianjin and hong kong en masse
2078659 it will be a unique opportunity for china to highlight its stability and economic viability to international business leaders after growth stunting decades of mao led communism
2078660 but thats not all in 2010 the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou are expected to bring in more visitors and stimulate more construction than even the olympics china has already spent nearly 35 billion on the olympics
2078661 they are expected to spend more on the other two events what does this mean for the chinese economy in the words of the u s government economic stimulus
2078662 since 1988 the host countrys stock market rose an average 38 in the year following a summer olympics the chinese market has been down since last october but china wont be down forever
2078663 since 1978 china has been revamping its infrastructure to be more business friendly the government realizes that cash is king in international finance
2078664 their government has been raising capital by depressing their domestic currency yuan and increasing exports to countries like the u s
2078665 its worked as of may china reportedly has 1 6 trillion on hand to stimulate their economic interests recently the chinese government has been strategically deploying cash to protect their market
2078666 in the past few months efforts have begun to take root no doubt as a result of chinese government intervention china seems ready to defend investors against any further decline
2078667 just like in the u s chinese consumers are the backbone of the economy however chinese consumers are not like american consumers consider this
2078668 the average chinese household saves 30 of their wages thats why most houses and apartments in china have been purchased in cash a big difference from the debt leveraged subprime laden u s economy
2078669 cash rich chinese consumers can afford to spend more because they have more to spend its just a matter of convincing consumers to part with savings for more goods and services
2078670 that problem is easier to solve than funding an economy with more debt thats why china looks more attractive than any other investment on the horizon
2078671 right now it looks very attractive the recent chart shows consolidation with an apparent double bottom in place trading over 19 million shares per day fxi is the most liquid chinese etf available
2078672 we think getting in just before the olympics is a great opportunity to profit from the buzz of the olympics and the underlying strength of the chinese economy to buy into china at a good low go with fxi
2078673 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
2078674 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
2078675 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
2078676 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
2078677 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
2078678 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease
2078679 one of my biggest pet peeves is companies who have false generosity but listening to what you guys are doing behind the scenes with unicef makes me motivated to give i want to save babies with you
2078680 okay im a writer but until i see at least one red cent im not an author
2078681 de trouwzaal blijft vandaag leeg vakantie weegt bij de inwoners van onze gemeente kennelijk zwaarder dan de symboliek van een getal deze dag wijkt niet af van andere dagen in het hoogseizoen de zomerperiode is voor ons altijd komkommertijd als het gaat over huwelijksvoltrekkingen
2078682 ik denk dat de rijssenaar te nuchter is om vanwege getallensymboliek voor deze datum te kiezen de stellen die vandaag bij mij het jawoord geven kozen in ieder geval niet vanwege de drie achten voor deze dag ik heb het er met hen natuurlijk wel over gehad ze vonden het een grappige bijkomstigheid maar het was voor hen zeker geen reden om voor deze dag te kiezen
2078683 natuurlijk is het leuk om er even naar te verwijzen
2078684 daarbij is het voor mij de 88e keer dat ik een huwelijk voltrek dat zijn weer twee achten maar verder dan gewoon leuk gaat het ook niet er zijn wel wezenlijker zaken om het bruidspaar voor te houden
2078685 dat is behoorlijk veel voor ons doen maar niet extreem ik denk dat de datum wel een rol speelt maar een vrijdag in de zomer is altijd een populaire trouwdag dus ik denk dat je de invloed van de getallensymboliek ook niet moet overdrijven
2078686 i must say the peanut butter chocolate was really delicious well that is i loved the icing but thought the cake part was just ok my taste test concluded that on the ones where the icing was a 10 the cake part of the cupcake was only like a 6 or 7 some of my friends thought i was nuts but hey we all have our likes and dislikes anyways some of my friends could eat pure butter and find it delicious so there you go
2078687 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2078688 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2078689 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2078690 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2078691 brought a burst of enthusiastic users forward thinking artists and stakeholders offering cool ways to move forward
2078692 but a main difference i can discern just from your description is that we do not believe in basing our model on extra work on the users part
2078693 there are very many existing referral models we dont think they scale well because of the extra barrier that is put up against everyday people these barriers appear when you make people recommend or refer or nag to get rewards we just want to reward every fan for being a fan now we do believe in rewarding certain fans in bigger ways but were not focused on referrals so much as the overall big picture of why fans are crucial to music
2078694 i think first off any time you see a company thats recognizing the importance of the fan in the process theyre to be commended
2078695 thats at the heart of what were doing so we are happy to see every new model that comes out that takes that slant
2078696 this is so cool it looks like a hipster bag i have
2078697 this contest is now closed thank you to all who applied
2078698 congratulations to amy of providence she won the contest thank you to all

2078700 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2078701 bal thackeray and his party shiv sena and the bjp student wing akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad abvp had given us funds regularly for maoists activities in mumbai
2078702 he ferreira said political parties will never support naxal organisations however only bal thackeray and his party shiv sena and the abvp helped the naxalites with funds
2078703 naxalism is born out of a communist agenda and it is a well documented fact that shiv sena has always opposed communists there is no way shiv sena will support naxal activities

2078712 with this resolution we take up an effort that began more than 150 years ago when visionary women came together to stand up for womens rights to better the status of women in our society in this tradition more than 11 years ago i first introduced the legislation that we consider this morning the paycheck fairness act and i cannot help but think of all the aprils we have commemorated equal pay day without legislative movement but today the legislative inertia we have experienced for years have come to an end the wage gap is real over the course of her lifetime a female high school graduate will make 700 000 less than the young man she graduates with compared to a man a female college graduate stands to lose up to 2 million in the course of her career this is true across the board
2078713 westpac gave out some very positive figures and the market liked it very reassuring for traders
2078714 we also saw continued strength in oil and gas producers including woodside petroleum which is not surprising considering we saw crude oil bounce off recent lows overnight

2078720 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2078721 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2078722 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2078723 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2078724 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2078725 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2078726 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
2078727 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2078728 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
2078729 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
2078730 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
2078731 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
2078732 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
2078733 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
2078734 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
2078735 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
2078736 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
2078737 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
2078738 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
2078739 the real travesty is that keithen valentine didnt get voted first team or second team
2078740 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2078741 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2078742 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2078743 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2078744 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2078745 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2078746 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2078747 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2078748 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2078749 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2078750 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2078751 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2078752 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2078753 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2078754 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2078755 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2078756 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
2078757 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do obama recalled
2078758 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
2078759 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
2078760 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
2078761 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2078762 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
2078763 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security
2078764 i think it is fair to say that i believe i can bring the country together more effectively than she can that is not entirely a problem of her making so of those battles in the 90s that she went through were the result of some pretty unfair attacks on the clintons but that history exists and so yes i believe i can bring the country together in a way she cannot do
2078765 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2078766 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2078767 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2078768 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2078769 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2078770 you can shove your arrogant candidacy where the sun dont shine
2078771 the legacy of retribution that he has mentioned so many times in his propaganda feeds to his cult followers
2078772 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2078773 i have not endorsed him and do not plan on endorsing him i dont endorse many statewide candidates
2078774 i think hes doing quite a good job on his own
2078775 i would say hes made some strong inroads into central massachusetts
2078776 hes very pleasant very personable i think hed make a great u s senator
2078777 people in massachusetts are looking for a full time senator not a full time candidate
2078778 well you know she really wasnt trying to sell the book last week too much going on there will be an up tick this week
2078779 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2078780 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
2078781 i think he should win and i think he will win
2078782 i think that the fundamental circumstances at home and abroad that work in his favor would work in any democrats favor
2078783 and i also think the demographics of the country have been moving steadily after moving away from us from 1968 to about 1996 theyve been moving back toward us for more than a decade now
2078784 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2078785 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2078786 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2078787 what usually happens is if you lose you go silent for a while
2078788 but hillarys supporters havent gone silent theyre still out there in the news
2078789 but we didnt fight fire with fire it couldve been scorched earth but thats not where our guy is
2078790 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2078791 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2078792 but we didnt fight fire with fire it couldve been scorched earth but thats not where our guy is
2078793 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2078794 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2078795 we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2078796 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2078797 what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated its as old as greek drama there is a catharsis i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then everybody can then go whew great now lets go out and win thats what we want people to feel
2078798 we do not want any democrat in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying im just not satisfied im not happy thats what im trying to avoid
2078799 if you look at recent history i have moved more quickly and done more on behalf of my opponent than comparable candidates have most of them didnt endorse until the convention teddy kennedy or gary hart jerry brown just a lot of people held out until the convention kept their delegates often waged platform or rules or credentials fights
2078800 ive made it very clear that im supporting senator obama and were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters
2078801 but delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
2078802 it would be better if we had a plan and we put it in place and executed it
2078803 as a husband and a father i believe that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman and i will support efforts in congress to protect the sanctity of this union
2078804 our chances in the fall really depend on our ability to get into the debates
2078805 if nader is allowed in the debates the sky is the limit on how well we could do in november
2078806 if nader is not in the debates then we are hoping to get the peace and freedom party permanent ballot status in iowa
2078807 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2078808 america is great and i want to make it greater
2078809 america is is no longer uh what it could be what it it once was
2078810 and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2078811 youre running for president of the u s and you run down the country to a 7 year old
2078812 sometimes it is meant as a compliment and sometimes it is meant as a criticism but what it really means is i understand who i work for i dont work for a party i dont work for a president i dont work for a special interest i dont work for myself i work for you and for the country we love
2078813 i applaud his talent and success all americans should be proud of his accomplishment but washington is full of talented talkers
2078814 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
2078815 and thats the problem with washington it is not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress its that everyone in washington says whatever it takes to get elected or to score the political point of the day we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2078816 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
2078817 and thats the problem with washington it is not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress its that everyone in washington says whatever it takes to get elected or to score the political point of the day we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2078818 america is is no longer uh what it could be what it it once was
2078819 and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2078820 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2078821 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2078822 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2078823 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2078824 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2078825 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2078826 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2078827 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2078828 the first round i got 99 e mails the second round i got 50 and the next round i got 60 all in the same day
2078829 i think it would ratchet up the intensity of people who feel passionately about their particular candidate to see that one or the other makes the final cut
2078830 you cant achieve unity by telling one side to shut up
2078831 you have to let the delegates vote for their candidate on the first ballot
2078832 i wouldnt call it mischief id call it good intentions hillary clinton not only ran a good race but also like barack obama was a first
2078833 but you know competition is part of what this country is all about
2078834 wayne county prosecutor kym worthy charged detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick and former chief of staff christine beatty today with perjury obstruction conspiracy and misconduct
2078835 dedan milton one of the mayors appointees said he is still running the city it is no different than if he is out of town on vacation it looks like he may be subjected to additional charges today namely assault for an incident earlier this year when the mayor attacked a cop
2078836 these are very serious charges sen obama believes that the legal process will resolve them appropriately
2078837 unfortunately mayor kilpatricks legal issues have escalated to a point where it is impacting not only the city of detroit but also the state
2078838 as i said last april it would be untenable to have the mayors legal issues take months to resolve the recent events demonstrate why a swift resolution was necessary for the good of the city as well as the state
2078839 mayor kilpatrick needs to step down so the city the region and the state can begin to move forward
2078840 if the mayor is exonerated in court i am confident he will be rewarded by the public for putting the people first during these challenging times
2078841 we are at the point where rather than run away people are forced to engage on this topic
2078842 before there were questions about whether theyd get their pictures taken together or share a podium
2078843 but now i dont think barack obama can even set foot in the city until this is resolved
2078844 senator obama believes that the legal process will resolve them appropriately and has confidence in the judgment of the people of detroit and the people of michigan
2078845 these are deeply troubling times for the people of detroit
2078846 a prompt resolution of the legal issues surrounding the mayor is essential so the city can focus on its future without this distraction
2078847 so that he shouldve gotten back to me by now
2078848 i would have liked to have heard back from him by now
2078849 the jury is still out on that i think hes looking at races on a case by case basis im not sure what goes into that calculus
2078850 some members were surprised that he endorsed barrow most thought he would remain neutral
2078851 i feel like his endorsement would be extremely helpful there are a lot of colleges and universities in my district ive never seen this kind of excitement from young people
2078852 barack obama cannot afford to snub the congresswoman and the mayor
2078853 the mayor is the only one in detroit that has the machine to turn out the vote
2078854 michigan is going to be an easy win for obama
2078855 the idea of michigan being a swing state is ridiculous
2078856 powell has made a linchpin of his campaign a criticism of towns for endorsing clinton
2078857 obamas endorsement can make a big difference in that concern
2078858 it would be a questionable decision at best or raw hypocrisy at worst if obama who stands for new politics in america would stand for the kind of problems bill jefferson has
2078859 sen obama looks forward to continuing to work closely with the cbc we were unaware of any concern in the weeks ahead we expect to have discussions with our democratic allies including leaders in the house and senate to talk about other races and what role senator obama might play in them
2078860 im asking people to judge me just as obama is asking people to judge him
2078861 the ads started last friday he could have said this earlier rather than on election day better late than never
2078862 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
2078863 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
2078864 you go straight at our people and talk about the difference between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
2078865 once people get in the booth if they wont vote for a black man
2078866 you get somebody like obama in there i think its a different side of the coin
2078867 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2078868 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2078869 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2078870 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2078871 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2078872 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2078873 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2078874 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2078875 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2078876 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2078877 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves

2078879 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
2078880 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

2078882 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
2078883 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
2078884 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
2078885 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
2078886 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
2078887 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
2078888 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
2078889 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
2078890 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
2078891 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
2078892 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street

2078921 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office

2078923 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2078924 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2078925 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2078926 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election

2079116 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
2079117 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
2079118 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off

2079340 regarding oil and gasoline we know that demand destruction is occurring in the united states now at least initially it appears slowing trade and global gdp growth will affect oil demand in emerging markets as well if the latter is the case oil could fall below 100 or even below 90 per barrel
2079341 investors and consumers for that matter have to keep in mind the nature of what theyre looking at regarding oils price weve seen an enormous bull run for oil in the past year alone with oil up 100 when it hit 147 earlier this year so the 30 drop can still be viewed as corrective
2079342 and when you pull the lens back even more you see that oil sold for about 23 per barrel in early 2003 so a considerable move down even 50 or 60 can occur and still be seen as merely profit taking by long term players
2079343 also the long term demand factors remain in place emerging market growth and development will eventually resume after a slowdown resuming pressure on oil absent an affordable substitute
2079344 so no one should assume a return to cheap oil

2079382 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2079383 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f u to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f u and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2079384 what can you do do people really feel better about themselves after they say stuff like that to me its disappointing im not too dumb im not going to say anything back to them its not my style its against my religion the boos i can understand those the other stuff i cant i cant really understand that its not very classy
2079385 i heard him yell a couple things im not going to make a judgment about someone like that its friday theyre here its a packers practice if youre going to root for the jets you dont have come to packers practice and yell stuff like he was yelling at me does he feel better about himself after doing that thats my question

2079395 if i was at the practice and i heard somebody say that kind of hit to a player id walk over there and tell them what kind of person they are right up into their grill
2079396 any way to answer your question a quality or even mediocre offensive guard would have got us over the hump to the sb the 13 yards rushing in the nfc champ game was the single most reason we didnt make it well that and mccarthys idiotic decision to practice indoors all week
2079397 wow you are such a bad more like you would have been shivering in the corner hoping the guy didnt notice you i think we got ourselves another keyboard warrior here

2079470 one critical caveat to keep at the forefront of ones mind is that when one side is in exclusive possession of all documents and can pick and choose which ones to release in full or in part in order to make their case while leaving out the parts that undercut the picture they want to paint which is exactly what the fbi is doing here then it is very easy to make things look however you want it is critical to keep in mind that all they released is their own claims and summary about the evidence they have the evidence itself continues to remain concealed in their exclusive possession examined by nobody what happened today with this selective document release is akin to a criminal trial where only the prosecutor is allowed to see the relevant evidence only the prosecutor is allowed to select which evidence is presented and only the prosecutor speaks such a distorted one sided process doesnt even happen at guantanamo which should by itself indicate how much skepticism is warranted here until the fbi makes the actual evidence available so that its claims can be subjected to critical scrutiny

2079546 fishing in utopia is a lament for a lost eden but it is more than that essentially it is a story of modern rootlessness and the search for something to believe in i can see it becoming a cult book and not just among anglers
2079547 a pervasive state apparatus a collective way of thinking the suppression of individuality
2079548 deftly weaving rhapsodies of fishing in swedish waters and political observations brown has written an idiosyncratic and highly enjoyable memoir of the fall of the new jerusalem of the left

2079561 contributes materially to higher diesel fuel and and crude oil prices by suppressing gasoline production
2079562 this view is contrary to what would seem to be conventional wisdom and as espoused by the proponents of the ethanol mandates who claim that ethanol is suppressing the price of gasoline at the pump but it is true nonetheless
2079563 the point is that it provides another avenue for a special interest to gain favor with powerful politicians

2079573 zero dark thirty were producing now with michael douglas and we just cast our lead
2079574 were very excited about who it is and theyre really going to bring a lot of uniqueness to the project were pretty determined to keep it really independent and now were sort of waiting for money you put these things together in pieces in order to protect them because if you take it down a studio road you lose all that control and it can fall out of your hands and suddenly it can become a musical comedy and what it is is a very very dark film about war it has a lot of provocative points of view and will probably elicit some interesting responses and to me thats the only version of the film worth making
2079575 its one of those things where we were going to shoot it two years ago and we literally were moving to new mexico and building locations and doing visual effects and then something went wrong with the investor they had a three movie package and ours was the third movie and the first two movies ran over budget and they tried to cut our budget in half and we said we cant change the movie that dramatically fortunately they were really good people and they understood that and they loved the movie and they gave it back to us very graciously so when were shooting then i know well be shooting
2079576 one of the problems is with investors they are very smart and they look at whats performing and the movie is a horror film so they look at horror films of the same budget range and they say this is a goldmine and then they look at the war films they look at last year at redacted and lions for lambs and stop loss and they say this movie will make not a dime they get really frightened and see nobody wants to see a movie about war now the thing is ours does not involve iraq or afghanistan you dont even know where the war is being fought and its not about the war its about someone who comes home from it so were walking a tight rope with it i think because of that it will be very unique and theres a huge audience for it but again when youre talking to people who are the bottom line they get nervous about it
2079577 monster island is a book that i optioned by this author named david wellington which is pretty good he wrote a book online and published it chapter by chapter without going back to revising it as he put the chapters online what im trying to do with my producing partner is say lets do something different for a zombie movie lets not do a ten million dollar five people trapped somewhere really low budget zombie movie lets spend ninety million dollars and do the 300 version of it and do the zombie movie nobodys ever seen before which is a dozen people on manhattan island fighting forty million zombies lets do a huge version of it its a lot to ask from a studio so were kind of developing it a little bit on the quiet side and trying to figure out the best way to sort of show people what the potential is

2079604 clear plan for achieving victory with troops levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan
2079605 john mccain believes that victory in iraq must be based on conditions on the ground not arbitrary timetables unlike barack obama that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the new york times
2079606 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
2079607 our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence
2079608 iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by congress last year to measure security political and economic progress
2079609 the difference between john mccain and barack obama is that barack obama advocates an unconditional withdrawal that ignores the facts on the ground and the advice of our top military commanders john mccain believes withdrawal must be based on conditions on the ground prime minister maliki has repeatedly affirmed the same view and did so again today timing is not as important as whether we leave with victory and honor which is of no apparent concern to barack obama the fundamental truth remains that senator mccain was right about the surge and senator obama was wrong we would not be in the position to discuss a responsible withdrawal today if senator obamas views had prevailed
2079610 barack was tired its been such a long campaign and all he just lost his bearings

2079748 there is volatility in the price of oil while there is a reduction now who knows it can also jump up the following day the volatility is something that we have to accept with due diligence in seeing to it that as prices goes up and down in the world market the consumer will be able to understand and accept whenever there is an increase that it is something that they should accept in the pump price and if there is reduction on the price in the world market they would like to expect an immediate reduction

2079752 but at least 10 scientists had regular access to the laboratory and its anthrax stock and possibly quite a few more counting visitors from other institutions and workers at laboratories in ohio and new mexico that had received anthrax samples from the flask at the army laboratory

2079822 in the 21st century where the most valuable skill is knowledge countries that out educate us today will out compete us tomorrow in the platform hearings americans made it clear that it is morally and economically unacceptable that our high schoolers continue to score lower on math and science tests than most other students in the world and continue to drop out at higher rates than their peers in other industrialized nations we cannot accept the persistent achievement gap between minority and white students or the harmful disparities that exist between different schools within a state or even a district
2079823 the democratic party clearly believes that graduation from a quality public school and the opportunity to succeed in college must be the birthright of every child not the privilege of the few we must prepare all our students with the 21st century skills they need to succeed by progressing to a new era of mutual responsibility in education we must set high standards for our children but we must also hold ourselves accountable our schools our teachers our parents business leaders our community and our elected leaders and we must come together form partnerships and commit to providing the resources and reforms necessary to help every child reach their full potential
2079824 make quality affordable early childhood care and education available to every american child from the day he or she is born
2079825 that every student has a high quality teacher and an effective principal
2079826 if you commit your life to teaching america will commit to paying for your college education
2079827 we should find a quick and fair way consistent with due process to put another teacher in that classroom
2079828 we will make an unprecedented national investment to teachers with better pay and better support to improve their skills and their students learning well reward effective teachers who teach in underserved areas take on added responsibilities like mentoring new teachers or consistently excel in the classroom
2079829 fix the failures and broken promises of no child left behind we will end the practice of labeling a school and its students as failures and then throwing our hands up and walking away from them without having provided the resources and supports these students need
2079830 we know that there is no program and no policy that can substitute for parents who are involved in their childrens education from day one who make sure their children are in school on time helps them with their homework and attends those parent teacher conferences who are willing to turn off the tv once in awhile put away the video games and read to their children responsibility for our childrens education has to start at home we have to set high standards for them and spend time with them and love them we have to hold ourselves accountable
2079831 we believe that our universities community colleges and other institutions of higher learning must foster among their graduates the skills needed to enhance economic competitiveness we will work with institutions of higher learning to produce highly skilled graduates in science technology engineering and math disciplines who will become innovative workers prepared for the 21st century economy
2079832 the unemployed and under employed to speed their transition into careers in high demand occupations and emerging industries

2079835 this administrations hostility to science has taken a toll at a time when technology helps shape our future we devote a smaller and smaller share of our national resources to research and development it is time again to lead
2079836 we will end the bush administrations war on science restore scientific integrity and return to evidence based decision making in sum we will strengthen our system treat science and technology as crucial investments and use these forces to ensure a future of economic leadership health well being and national security

2079852 alkoholpolitikkerne har allerede gjort indtog p en stor del af landets arbejdspladser samtidig intensiveres kampen mod fedme ikke bare p arbejdspladserne men ogs p skoler og i institutioner og selvom vi m ske ikke vil se deciderede forbud p disse omr der s vil vi med tiden h jst sandsynligt se politikerne give folk et st rre incitament til at leve sundt ved at ge afgifterne p de usunde og s nke momsen p de sunde varer

2079942 i actually turned to them on the commercial break and i told them id see them in the finale and thats not to look for pity it wasnt for them to say no youre going to be safe i respect both of them so much as artists and ive learned so much from both of them maybe even more so than everyone else because both of them truly do understand who they are as artists so to be standing next to them in the bottom 3 was definitely weird because i didnt think they belonged there but to be honest no one else deserved to be there
