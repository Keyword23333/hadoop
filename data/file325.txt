3250000 the killings by jorge 40 have occurred in territories where there are major businesses and enterprises the part of the country with the most common graves after putumayo is the area of ci naga and fundaci n there the attorney generals office has detected more than 300 clandestine graves surrounded by what was a prosperous banana industry which included the participation of the controversial multinational chiquita brands
3250001 last january 16 47 ak 47 rifles which appear to have come from the otterloo ship were confiscated from the don mario organization through the heroes de casta o bloc daniel rend n herrera has taken over the areas of several former paramilitary chiefs and has killed 70 persons close to those who killed his friend carlos casta o since at least a year ago he began to appropriate the drug trafficking markets and military spaces that were previously occupied by the former paras salvatore mancuso diego fernando murillo bejarano don berna and ramiro vanoy murillo aka cuco of the more than 3 thousand 500 rifles from the otterloo the demobilized persons only surrendered a small amount of them to the uribe government within the auc demobilization process the authorities work with the hypothesis that don mario is rearming his army a hybrid between former self defense forces and drug traffickers with the remaining weapons don mario officially appears among the persons that demobilized from the lmer c rdenas bloc then at the command of is younger brother aka el alem n and even though the government has reiterated that those who return to committing crimes automatically lose the benefits of the law of justice and peace no legal mechanism has yet to be enabled for this purpose
3250002 all of the banana companies paid us every one of them t oward the end of 1997 the father of ra l hasb n a banana entrepreneur died in a airplane accident this resulted in a meeting of all the banana companies in which ra l hasb n was named the banana company representative for dealing with the self defense forces following this meeting ra l became the intermediary and later a commander of the bananero bloc chiquita brands inc dole banacol uniban proban and del monte all entered into this agreement they paid us one cent for every box of bananas that left the country the rest of the companies of the sector made a contribution every six months the dole company was in charge of collecting the money and completing the operation the others had full knowledge of the payments which were registered as contributions to the papagayo convivir the sum of these contributions was distributed proportionally among casa casta o the bananero bloc a part for social investment and another to pay off state institutions ra l hasb n explained its workings to jorge 40 who was put in charge of duplicating the process in magdalena the massacres allowed them to take apart the systems of social assistance negotiated with the unions
3250003 t he former paramilitary chief salvatore mancuso assured that the multinational chiquita brands accepted paying the paramilitary groups for their security without there being any threats and he offered to reveal all of the ties between the multinationals with the paramilitaries in colombia no it is not true they were pressured says mancuso they paid taxes because we were like a state in the area and because we were providing them with protection which enabled them to continue making investments and a financial profit explained mancuso additionally the former paramilitary chief assured that chiquita brands was not the only company that agreed to pay the paramilitaries for their security all companies in the banana region paid for instance there was dole and del monte which i believe are u s companies he told the us network
3250004 there wasnt any need to pressure blackmail or threaten the banana companies for them to pay the percentages the truth is we never thought about what would happen because the representatives for the companies did so willingly claimed mancuso
3250005 i t is secret to nobody especially in the area of urab that the multinationals paid these funds through an intermediary of a corporation for the matter of security
3250006 according to our intelligence reports the company used for these shipments is named chiquita
3250007 indicated that ra l hazb n aka pedro bonito or pedro aponte ordered the crimes committed by the self defense forces in the area from 1996 to 2004
3250008 implicated the current mayor of carepa arnulfo pe uela mar n with the convivir associations that operated in the area of urab and with the illegal activities of these groups alias h h declared under oath before the prosecutor from the justice and peace unit that mayor pe uela mar n was a part of the board of directors of one of these convivir and told that these associations were created in urab from 1996 to 1997 by the entrepreneur ra l hasb n who he assured belonged to the self defense forces through the convivir associations the self defense forces charged vacunas payments and extortion from the banana companies in the region of urab among them chiquita brands confessed the former paramilitary chief who commanded the presently demobilized bananero bloc
3250009 resumed testimony before the attorney generals office with new accusations against the ruling class from urab department of antioquia in the proceedings from yesterday he implicated several political leaders from the area in alleged political agreements with the auc in his testimony he also reiterated the ties between the mayor from the municipality of carepa arnulfo pe uela and the auc after the mayor had said he never had a relationship with veloza according to the former chief of the bananero bloc the elected mayor toward the end of the 90s the director of the papagayo convivir accompanied him and another auc commander aka doble cero to meet with senior military commanders on several occasions
3250010 reiterated that the banana companies supported the arrival of the self defense forces to the region to combat the guerrilla he also said that the convivir were created to legalize the payments by the banana companies in order to militarily maintain the illegal group he also stated that in exchange for security the banana companies paid the auc three cents for every box of exported bananas and he admitted they used threats to force banana company employees to work when they organized strikes he also admitted to the murder of banana workers the banana companies never paid us to kill trade unionists but with the money paid to the auc many crimes were clearly committed against workers he stated the paramilitary chief revealed that many of the banana ships were loaded with drugs at several ports scuba divers paid by drug traffickers even fastened some drug laden tubes to the hulls of the ships at high sea to evade the control points of the security agencies every month 4 000 kilos of drugs left from our region to panama and central america asserted veloza garc a
3250011 extraditions should be from here to there usa and from there to here colombia the decision to request them is in the hands of the attorney generals office
3250012 it is certainly a hypocrisy that while here we fight to catch the bandits to extradite them there they make such indignant arrangements
3250013 we hope the attorney generals office carries out the corresponding investigations that they ask for all the information we should request the attorney general to look into this issue an interpol red notice for some of the senior executives of multinationals makes their life uncomfortable at least they wont be able to leave the country
3250014 from a formal point of view the us justice system has some parameters that deserve all of our respect however this does not mean that the public is not somewhat perplexed that such an important case does not result in anyone going to jail
3250015 naturally they may be prosecuted in colombia what we are seeing here is a judicial case that has gone before american courts in which colombia has not had any participation
3250016 the ministry of foreign affairs lets it be known that if the conduct of officials from the banana company chiquita brands classifies as any crime in colombia with the support of the attorney generals office we will request the extradition of these persons to the country
3250017 the government is analyzing the possibility that the unit in charge of the nations legal defense advises the victims of paras in urab and magdalena so the executives from chiquita brands may be held responsible in colombia
3250018 this is governed by international law standards that are in force in both countries there is the possibility that colombia asks for us citizens in extradition just as the united states may ask for nationals
3250019 the agreement is unbecoming of the us justice system because it creates the sensation that impunity may be bought for a few million dollars
3250020 it makes no sense that a transnational buys impunity for 25 million dollars either here or anywhere
3250021 with these funds terrorist groups have put our homeland into mourning they should face justice
3250022 i think chiquita escaped any kind of appropriate sanctions we will take a good hard look at how american multinationals operate around the world using colombia as a model it really deserves an exhaustive effort to examine where we need legislation and if there are gaps in our criminal code that allow u s corporations to aid or abet violence in other countries that erode our credibility and our moral standing in the world do our economic interests trump the war on terror are we making trade offs if we are at the very least the public should know about it
3250023 up to now the colombian government has not spoken with us about any extradition and we would have to follow our extradition treaty to the letter
3250024 chiquitas position is that the payments were made for protection so they would not be attacked during the time of their presence in colombia this justification is not acceptable
3250025 i hope that this the extradition of the chiquita directors is not a problem between the two governments i have no reason to believe it would be because in the end the two governments and the two countries have the same objective and desire to eliminate the activities of the violent groups
3250026 i do not doubt in the slightest that there will be collaboration in accordance with our formal obligations and the excellent bilateral relationship we enjoy
3250027 there is no criminal investigation at a preliminary or investigative stage where the mentioned citizen appears as a complainant or defendant
3250028 it is quite possible overwhelmingly probable one might guess that we will always learn more about human life and human personality from novels than from scientific psychology
3250029 hold up a second i think fill in the blank is untrue or unfair or thats not what i believe
3250030 commits his crimes under circumstances that make it well nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he is doing wrong
3250031 if this had been written by a man wed never touch it
3250032 i have reason to know the kids who were involved the families who were involved and ive never known them to harbor this type of feeling

3250042 too many people are now not taking important medicines for pain depression and other illnesses because the nejm jama the lancet and the british medical journal have allowed their political love fest with the leftists in the media and their hatred of drug companies to pollute their ability to remain objective
3250043 a world renowned harvard child psychiatrist whose work has helped fuel an explosion in the use of powerful antipsychotic medicines in children
3250044 is that anyone who supports the use of psychiatric pharmaceuticals for any reason needs to be humiliated and destroyed
3250045 there is no credible scientific evidence linking antidepressants to suicide or violence
3250046 also unmentioned were the unrestricted grants that the infinite mind has received from drug makers including eli lilly the manufacturer of the antidepressant prozac
3250047 a former fda associate commissioner who was involved in the fdas 2004
3250048 what we didnt know because he didnt disclose it to us
3250049 was that pitts is currently working for a public relations firm whose clients include major pharmaceutical companies
3250050 i think its important to note that per full disclosure i was never asked i would like to assume that when i am called for interviews that the producers have done their due diligence
3250051 i also want to be clear that on the other programs mentioned
3250052 i was asked by the producers about my various affiliations i answered fully and honestly and the decision was made not to mention it on the air
3250053 peter pitts have you no shame does anyone have the dsmiv diagnosis for habitual lieing sic ed

3250056 a robust debate on the ssri issue is very important
3250057 trying to stifle debate by personal attacks just shows a lack of intellectual rigor and cowardice
3250058 where will healy david graham and the rest go to wash the blood off their hands and will the fda do the right thing and stop handing black boxes out to protect themselves from senator grassley and the press
3250059 mr pitts looking at all those posts on drugwonks com i couldnt tell who was making the personal attacks the kooks and the document stealers or the sites authors who label them that way
3250060 shannon brownlee and jeanne lenzer did a smear job on peter and dr fred goodwin in slate
3250061 we will do what ever it takes including legal action when facts are deliberately omitted misrepresented and distorted and then willfully repeated to set the records straight
3250062 we are aware that our critics dont have the intellectual bandwidth or the maturity to actually engage on the issues or respectfully disagree or debate
3250063 still we expect accuracy and for others to provide some context even as they take their shots as they are entitled to in a free society
3250064 woah mr pitts what a shame you sold your intellectual bandwidth and your integrity out to the pharmaceutical industry
3250065 our willingness to challenge those who have been responsible for scaring people from using antidepressants have diverted attention away from the consequences of a decrease in use with blind fury
3250066 moving from antidepressants to antipsychotics without regard to the original argument or point harping instead on funding sources with an obsession that reveals a lack of intellectual bandwidth and genuine hatred that borders on the personal
3250067 the blogs that have allowed these posting unfiltered know better and bear a responsibility for allowing the attacks and vitriol to become so unhinged and personal
3250068 the problem is they often reflect and influence the thinking of people like brownlee and lenzer who are considered mainstream
3250069 we at cmpi are simply trying to insure that people get the right medicine at the right time
3250070 wow gsk takes on the one person who has been the poster boy for all thats bad with pharma and the fda way to help your public relations
3250071 but there is also the holy grail of overturing fda pre emption
3250072 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him
3250073 i heard your book on tape and im now convinced that george bush deceived congress
3250074 ive already bought several copies of your book and ive passed them out to colleagues and i told them read the book
3250075 there may be as many as one million victims not one victim but one million victims in their cold graves right now decomposing as a result of george bushs monumental crime
3250076 what person in authority on the face of this globe is representing these one million people in their graves fighting to bring about justice for them pursuing the person the guilty person who put them there
3250077 no you didnt hear what i said i said what person in authority is going after the killer of these million people
3250078 i dont have the authority of an emaciated moth i dont have any authority
3250079 i agree that he should bush should be prosecuted for murder and i hope he is prosecuted for murder
3250080 mr bugliosi come november im going to be out in the public with you and i want to be at your side when george bush hopefully is indicted for first degree murder
3250081 i support you and i want bush to be prosecuted for first degree murder
3250082 is there someone out there that i dont know about thats come forward
3250083 well yeah a lot of people are angry but they dont have the courage to do anything about it

3250192 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3250193 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3250194 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3250196 now from the hapless but increasingly venomous mccain campaign comes the slimy britney spears and paris hilton ad
3250197 the republican national committee targeted harold ford with a similarly disgusting ad in 2006 when mr

3250200 it is hoped that the businessmen would take the lead in reviving the economy by creating jobs through active investment and exploring markets abroad
3250201 i am well aware of the criticism among some people and so it was a difficult decision
3250202 but i made the decision because of the fact that the executives are having problems doing business overseas and that investor sentiment is hardly robust
3250203 whats happening to the dollar has to do with a shift in relative growth and interest rate expectations
3250204 the currencies that have come under the most pressure especially over the last three or four days have been those where until recently inflation concerns dominated and now the slowdown in the global economy has generated a shift lower in interest rate expectations
3250205 the current price rises arent driven by strong demand so will be a drag on corporate and household activity its a negative for japans economy
3250206 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies in the second half of the year
3250207 frankly speaking the way its dropping i think 800 will be taken out very soon just look at the rise in the dollar and plunge in the euro golds decline is quite justifiable
3250208 gold has broken the chart points and everybody is rushing to sell their gold it seems to be very bad we are waiting for gold to hit 800
3250209 with everything falling i guess platinum will follow suit i am currently looking at the 1 400 levels for support

3250217 viele kollegen sind nicht auf dem neuesten stand und k nnen es auch nicht sein weil sich die leitlinien oft ndern
3250218 in bis zu 30 prozent der f lle ist die behandlung tats chlich nicht optimal
3250219 es ist eigentlich unverantwortlich eine krankheit wie solide hodentumore ohne zweite meinung zu behandeln
3250220 soweit wir wissen wurden diese behandlungsvorschl ge fast ausnahmslos in die tat umgesetzt
3250221 wir hatten innerhalb der letzten acht monate 900 r ckfragen 200 davon landeten bei den entsprechenden professoren

3250225 given todays circumstances i think we would make the interpretation that dry climate ground cover would include artificial turf

3250227 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese

3250229 it was absolute excitement shock in the utmost of wattage
3250230 it was just so unexpected it was so clear that the french were going to win this race and it was like a switch was flipped and lezak pulled it out
3250231 those others pop off the screen and stand out but they dont have all the elements this one had with all the characters involved and the hollywood script
3250232 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3250233 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew taehwan park was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3250234 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake it was a very fast time when i saw the 1 by my name i thought they had made a mistake then i saw my name there and i realized that id got it
3250235 she wins she has a smile and a bubbling personality she makes gymnastics fun to watch
3250236 normally girls are very shy but she just came in and jumped on the uneven bars like they were her home
3250237 he and his wife have given up a lot to get me where i am theyve worked as hard as i have to get here and theyre like my second parents
3250238 i am a caring girl who loves to flip i wonder what the world will be like in 100 years i hear the uplifting laughter of children i see colorful daises swaying in the wind i want the ones i love to be with me forever i am a caring girl who loves to flip
3250239 i wrote it and showed to my mom and said it was something that i found on the internet
3250240 i just wanted to know what she thought i liked it but sometimes if people know its yours they dont tell you their opinion
3250241 when i showed it to her she said mom i wrote that
3250242 she doesnt theres nothing different at home honestly i go to work every day and she goes to school every day
3250243 people think were enemies but its not true were different athletes with different body styles
3250244 when they came from china they were so well known and such successful athletes
3250245 i wanted to take them back to their home country and prove to them that they are still successful i want to make them proud
3250246 weve been tested at the world championships weve been tested too many times and there are too many losses for too many of these players
3250247 we have the goal of taking home the gold so were never going to slack off especially not on purpose
3250248 the score doesnt matter we dont care about the margin
3250249 not just the endeavor and the quickness and the athleticism but the precision and the shooting was just really beautiful and their rebounding was exceptional
3250250 they really played wonderful basketball were not quite ready to match them when they play like that
3250251 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3250252 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3250253 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3250254 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3250255 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out
3250256 i dont want an excuse i cant control the environment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3250257 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity
3250258 the truth i didnt feel nothing from the pollution that didnt affect me
3250259 the problem is the humidity i had to change the shirt every 10 minutes
3250260 not just the quickness and the athleticism but the precision and the shooting was just really beautiful and their rebounding was exceptional
3250261 not only us but other countries as well and thats a good thing you go watch a game its not boring you know other players from other countries its good for the sport
3250262 thats not who we are thats not how we play
3250263 its a little shocking and thats definitely not our intention and we dont want anyone to think that way or feel that way that that was our intention
3250264 it was a very physical game all the way around i dont think that one team was being more physical than the other and i have the bruises to prove it
3250265 womens basketball has become more physical and it had to because the players are better
3250266 look at some of the players on our team if you just let them do what they want let them have their way they will tear you up you have to take something away make players uncomfortable
3250267 we know were the team everyone is shooting for because of all the success we have had over the years we know that any time you dont bring your game you can be beaten
3250268 i was feeling a little bit of panic because of the injury because it really hurt when it first happened
3250269 it eased up a little as i was laying there maybe from adrenaline or something but i was thinking that the same thing happened to me in 2004 when i was in college and might have been able to make the olympic team in the 200
3250270 that was one of the greatest experiences of my life and i will always remember it
3250271 i dont know how hes taking it but i would assume theres a lot of pressure
3250272 regardless of what anybody says people in his country and most other countries are expecting him to come home with that gold medal
3250273 a guy came up to me in the athletes village cafeteria yesterday and mentioned i hope you dont break up our sweep you know 1 2 we laughed about it and joked around but im pretty sure thats a real thing i mean asafa powell has been around for a long time hes been a world record holder and that means a lot to him usain bolt is a guy who likes to have a lot of fun but he is the world record holder now and hell try to hold on to that
3250274 right now there hasnt been this much hype around one event in a long time asafa is a very confident strong runner usain bolt has come onto the scene in track those two guys have done things that a lot of people have never seen before
3250275 myself i have one championship under my belt and im the american record holder i kind of fall into that class with the 9 7 runners thats whats making it all so amazing with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible

3250307 los casos de legislaci n excepcional previstos en la constituci n
3250308 es una grosera violaci n de la constituci n y las leyes que ahora se pretende subsanar con la reforma del art culo 140 de la ley org nica de la administraci n p blica sin embargo no hay dudas de que en el momento en que hizo el cambio reg a una ley que le imped a actuar unilateralmente como lo hizo tampoco hay dudas de que en este caso no procede una aplicaci n retroactiva de la referida reforma
3250309 pero cuando el poder ejecutivo asume las facultades de la asamblea nacional la participaci n ciudadana adquiere mayor relevancia se convierte en la nica garant a de control sobre la regulaci n de derechos fundamentales sobre todo porque se han ampliado casi ilimitadamente los mbitos de la habilitaci n presidencial
3250310 todos los decretos leyes dictados en ejecuci n de la ley habilitante son nulos desde que carecieron del procedimiento previo de consulta p blica que garantiza la participaci n ciudadana

3250314 what did i get myself into i cant get out of this how is this going to work
3250315 georgias military plans reveal its ambition to reclaim the territories of abkhazia and south ossetia it lost in the wars of the early 1990s
3250316 according to the official goal of joining nato georgia needs to modernize its army train its soldiers and build facilities for them
3250317 but observers in tbilisi point that out patterns of spending suggest that georgia has other projects apart from its nato ambitions
3250318 the army also received significant training assistance as well as equipment from the united states military
3250319 georgia also received valuable equipment such as ten uh 1 transportation helicopters from the us government the value of the us military cooperation with the georgian armed forces in 2007 is estimated at 34 million as a result some 16 000 troops are now considered trained by the us military
3250320 the fact that the two new barracks are close to the conflict zones of abkhazia and south ossetia has led to concerns among both the de facto governments of those two regions and the international community that seeks a peaceful resolution to these conflicts
3250321 the russian military is continuing to empty its former soviet base in akhalkalaki transporting equipment and ammunition into its base in gumri in northern armenia akhalkalaki base is expected to be emptied by the end of the year while the russian base in batumi the next year
3250322 after this period the russian presence will be limited to the cis peacekeeping missions in south ossetia and abkhazia
3250323 moscow is increasingly displeased to see the nato and specifically us military presence becoming permanent in what once was part of its southern soviet provinces
3250324 the recent announcement in tbilisi to increase georgian military participation in iraq from 850 to 2 000 comes at a time when most european nations have already started withdrawing their troops and the bush administration is under political pressure in washington to come up with its own schedule to decrease troops

3250333 its all about my dad this year said rice a fifth year senior
3250334 he put in all this time throughout his life to come to see me in person and now hes not going to be able to do that but im going to make it special for him hes got a great view thats for sure
3250335 the only way to describe it is i felt like it was the worst nightmare id ever been in for that first 20 minutes but you dont wake up chase rice said
3250336 he would just reassure me say something like son i know who you are and i know this isnt going to stop you
3250337 and here he was going through cancer and you would never know it he lived his life like those guys in the bucket list if he could do that there was no question in my mind that i would come back and play again too
3250338 he really is an excellent leader coach butch davis said of chase rice who is practicing as a first team linebacker
3250339 he wants so much for this football program to have a good season and i think that his fathers death adds a little bit of a burning passion inside of him to do well and i certainly hope he has the type of season he wants to have this year
3250340 i just remember that he never sat down said offensive lineman garrett reynolds one of chase rices good friends and roommates
3250341 so that first game its going to be especially hard
3250342 but chase keeps saying his dad has got front row seats so i think hes going to play lights out every play play with every bit of his heart
3250343 therefore you now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart will rejoice and your joy no one will take from you
3250344 whoever introduces some good practice in islam will have the reward of it as well as the reward of those who act on it after him without their rewards being diminished in any respect and whoever introduces some evil practice in islam will bear the burden of it as well as the burden of those who act on it after him without theirs being diminished in any respect
3250345 every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance
3250346 whoever introduces something good and is followed by others will have the reward of it completely as for the reward of those who follow him their reward will not be diminished at all and whoever introduces something evil and is followed by others will carry the burden of it completely as for the burden of those who follow him their burden will not be diminished at all
3250347 whoever introduces something good and is followed by others he will have the reward of it as well as the reward of those who follow him without their reward being diminished at all and whoever introduces something evil and is followed by others he will carry the burden of it as well as the burden of those who follow him without their burden being diminished at all
3250348 whoever introduces a good practice will have reward for it for whoever acts on it during his lifetime and after his death until it is left off and whoever introduces an evil practice will bear the sin of it until it is left off and whoever dies defending the land of the muslims in the path of allah the act of defending continues to be written for him until he is resurrected on the day of resurrection
3250349 whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours will have it rejected
3250350 it informs us that innovations are of two kinds that which is not of the religion because of its conflicting with its rules and evidences so it is rejected and it is a misguided innovation
3250351 we were performing salah when a man arrived who had missed part of the salah the person next to him indicated to him you missed such and such so he performed it
3250352 we were between bowing and prostrating and standing and sitting so i came and had missed part of the 2 it was indicated to me what i had missed
3250353 i do not find him in any state except that i am in that state so i was with them in the state which i found them upon then when the prophet saw completed i stood and prayed
3250354 muadh has initiated a practice for you so follow him in it if any of you comes and has missed something of the salah then let him pray with the imam then when the imam completes the salah let him perform that which he missed out
3250355 although the prophet saw did say to the people of makkah during his pilgrimage
3250356 he begged forgiveness from his lord and fell down prone prostrating and repented
3250357 salah is better than sleep salah is better than sleep
3250358 we were praying one day behind the prophet saw when he raised his head from
3250359 i saw more than thirty angels rushing to see which of them would write it down first
3250360 it is inferred from this the permissibility of originating dhikr in the salah which is not transmitted if it does not conflict with those which are transmitted
3250361 were it not that you would have said he is afraid of death i would have increased the salah i dont care about any hardship my death is for allah
3250362 i do not care when i am being killed as a muslim

3250366 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
3250367 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
3250368 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate
3250369 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace

3250372 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3250373 ive gone to a driving range before and hit golf balls because i saw tiger woods doing it on tv
3250374 i want more minority kids to go to a swimming pool and try to swim because of me i know im nowhere near tiger woods but i want to make a difference i want kids to say look a black swimmer and hes got a gold medal and i want them to get in the water because of it
3250375 lets say two kids are walking beside a pool and one decides it would be funny to push the other one in
3250376 if the one who gets pushed in can swim yeah maybe its funny if he cant youve got a real problem
3250377 sometimes they dont fit the mold you imagine not all kids are going to grow up and be doctors
3250378 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
3250379 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
3250380 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate
3250381 my daughter who has my two young grandkids mentioned him to me last night
3250382 i had heard about him but she mentioned him again and how proud she was and what kind of work he was doing
3250383 i think thats definitely something that has always been in the back of his mind
3250384 i tried to tell him to get into the water awhile ago and he was like no
3250385 or if i have enough money after i finish paying my bills maybe even twice a day
3250386 i think its more of a socio economic factor where there are some kids that just dont get the exposure to swimming and others that do
3250387 i cant really gauge whether the interest is there because the minorities are there or because they have no other option or because theyre directed to this pool or what
3250388 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
3250389 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords

3250398 i just remember that he never sat down said offensive lineman garrett reynolds one of chase rices good friends and roommates
3250399 so that first game its going to be especially hard
3250400 but chase keeps saying his dad has got front row seats so i think hes going to play lights out every play play with every bit of his heart
3250401 therefore you now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart will rejoice and your joy no one will take from you

3250426 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
3250427 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
3250428 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate

3250432 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3250433 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it
3250434 it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time
3250435 i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3250436 im just thinking about my next start and helping this team win as many games as we can

3250440 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaida we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3250441 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3250442 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3250443 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope
3250444 we must move beyond an alliance built on individual leaders or face mounting opposition in a nuclear armed nation at the nexus of terror extremism and instability wrought by autocracy

3250452 my friends and i not too long ago were watching an older movie when the main character who had never met the lead female character initiated their conversation by commenting on how
3250453 less than half a century disregarded woman had been transformed into honored lady in effigy if not in the flesh
3250454 the feminist wisdom so many of us received growing up to delay marriage to delay children to put everything into our work may help us achieve good jobs but little else its harder to meet and attract men in your thirties than in your twenties its more difficult to start families later in life not to mention extremely inconvenient to have to deal with a newborn in mid career its also very tough in the aftermath of the sexual revolution to find men willing to marry and take on the responsibilities of family when theres a big supply of single women out there willing to sleep with them without demanding commitment in return
3250455 an unrestricted sociosexual orientation the endorsement of casual sex has been found to correlate with undesirable behaviors and personality characteristics more so in men than in women using a community sample of men and women we investigated the correlations between sociosexuality and behaviors motives attitudes and fantasies related to sexual aggression participants n 168 ages 21 45 completed self report measures of sociosexual orientation sexual conservatism rape myth acceptance adversarial sexual beliefs attitudes toward women sexual behaviors and perpetration of sexual aggression participants also wrote five brief stories that were scored for power and affiliation intimacy motives and two sexual fantasies that were coded for the theme of dominance for both men and women an unrestricted sociosexual orientation was correlated with behavioral items indicating earlier life experiences with sex a greater number of lifetime sex partners and more frequent sexual activity for men an unrestricted sociosexual orientation was linked with higher levels of rape myth acceptance and adversarial sexual beliefs more conservative attitudes toward women higher levels of power motivation and lower levels of affiliation intimacy motivation and past use of sexual aggression

3250459 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

3250461 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
3250462 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3250463 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3250464 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3250477 my divine heart so ardently loves men that unable to contain within itself any longer the flames of its burning love it needs must spread them with your assistance and thus it will show itself that all men may be enriched with its most precious treasures
3250478 it is the ingratitude of men which has hurt me more than all the suffering i underwent during my passion if only they would make some return for my love i should think but little of all i have done for them and would wish were it possible to suffer still more but the sole return they make for all my eagerness to do them good is to reject me and treat me with coldness do thou at least console me by supplying for their ingratitude as far as thou art able
3250479 behold this heart which has loved men so much that it has spared nothing even to exhausting and consuming itself in order to testify to them its love and in return i receive from the greater number nothing but ingratitude by reason of their irreverence and sacrileges and by the coldness and contempt which they show me in this sacrament of love

3250484 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3250485 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3250486 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3250487 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3250488 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3250512 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3250513 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3250514 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3250515 drug use should be treated in the same way as alcohol and nicoteine sic which are both deadly drugs sold on shopping shelves and taxed to the hilt by every government
3250516 the worldwide web is an interesting beast and it provides great opportunity for information dissemination but also information distortion

3250526 if i were a principal and a teacher had been in a dysfunctional school for 10 or 15 years given human nature i would probably be more careful about an interview than if that teacher had only been there a couple of years
3250527 you can imagine that a good teacher would not be willing to tolerate complete dysfunction
3250528 on the other hand you could have the true saints in the world who stick it out because they love the kids
3250529 i would be very cautious in labeling people because of a reconstitution as unqualified teachers or teachers that arent worth considering
3250530 i would hope that everyone is fair and equitable in trying to fill their positions
3250531 we just dont know yet as far as how many might be hired

3250541 i said lets just back off and see what shell do
3250542 mr ryan likes to bring her candy but i have to discourage that
3250543 if she gets too much sugar she goes into some sort of sugar high and starts running around all over the place

3250550 its inexcusable on the federal and state level that someone could do what was reported
3250551 they lost their permit reapplied and continued to operate thats just an embarrassment to the whole system
3250552 they could be figuring out how to respond whether theyre are going to adopt our recommendations or propose an alternative
3250553 you cant simply sit down with a piece of paper and start writing
3250554 its got to be based on research and exploring a number of alternatives to decide what the new standard will be
3250555 my point is the texas legislature could pass all kinds of laws and it wouldnt make any difference to a guy like that

3250557 if someone is intent on doing something bad they usually dont tell us ahead of time there isnt much the governor could have done to prevent this
3250558 china has maintained public ownership over most health facilities making public provision of care the dominant mode for the majority of services while legitimizing profit seeking behavior at public facilities through a set of perverse incentives in contrast india has followed a policy of benign neglect and allowed entrance into and expansion of the private sector to fill in the gaps with little effective regulation or enforcement
3250559 these seemingly sensible cross subsidies have created perverse incentives for providers who now have to generate 90 percent of their budget from revenue generating activities turning hospitals township health centers and village doctors alike into profit seeking entities as a result even though structurally the delivery system of china is public the behavior of public facilities is consistent with that of for profit private providers
3250560 the public sector too is inefficient with shortages of drugs and consumables and frequent absenteeism

3250562 it is estimated for the fiscal year of 2007 that the city will be in excess of the calculated growth cap by 1 630 400 a factor in the calculated growth cap is the open space monies that the city currently collects from arapahoe and jefferson counties these monies are restricted for uses related to open space and are reported in the open space fund this alternative would exclude this restricted funding source from the tabor excess revenue calculation

3250569 too many consumers spend time on the internet without knowledge or notice that they are under commercial surveillance
3250570 they assume they are in the privacy of their own home and that this privacy will be respected unfortunately this is not always the case
3250571 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them

3250574 perhaps one of the most worrying of all the losses of personal data
3250575 whilst the ministers response does not reveal any detail of the type of losses or breaches any loss or breach of a medical record whatsoever is a serious matter

3250583 in chicago this has not been the case since the champions tm world series match the chicago fire has averaged 17 086 fans per home match a slight decline in attendance from their pre match levels
3250584 by many measures soccer in the united states is doing well on the tenth anniversary since the establishment of major league soccer in 1996 there are numerous statistics that support the claim that american soccer at the recreational professional and international levels is in fact successful
3250585 the sporting goods manufacturers association sgma of america claims that as of 2002 1 3 million more kids played soccer than little league baseball 2 american youth are choosing soccer over the national pastime furthermore the sgma reveals that in 2001 over 19 million americans were playing soccer a 23 8 percent increase from 1987 3 of the 19 million americans playing soccer 8 775 000 are from ages 6 11 6 197 000 from 12 17 1 640 000 from 18 24 911 000 from 25 34 and 1 519 000 35

3250587 why do you think americans have a different view of soccer than the rest of the world
3250588 can european football spur interest in american soccer a look at the champions world tm series and major league soccer
3250589 it is simply not a sport that most people follow as sports fans as they do baseball basketball and football
3250590 this can be illustrated in terms of television ratings the 2003 mls cup match was only able to muster a rating of 0 6 11 while the 2003 world series 12 garnered a 13 9 the 2003 nba finals series earned a 6 5 and the super bowl 13 earned a 41 3 rating
3250591 why do you think americans have a different view of soccer than the rest of the world
3250592 youre already a fan you just dont know it yet
3250593 the individual consumer alone or collectively no longer needs or accepts being told by any aspirants to higher authority what to do what to think what to buy
3250594 emphasizes the role of coercion and power a persons or groups ability to exercise influence and control over others in producing social order
3250595 one of the basic conflicts in conflict theory is that of class there are low amp high ranks in class and that gives a certain group more power over another group which causes conflicts
3250596 another basic conflict in conflict theory is that of race amp ethnicity much like in the class system groups in this system are ranked by their prestige amp power this means that if a certain race or ethnicity has more education prestige amp power then it is considered the better race or ethnicity which creates conflict
3250597 most social classes dont form their ideologies the same different groups will struggle in conflict over what they think is right what the norms are amp their ideologies higher classes have more abstract ideologies while subordinated classes that are much less to their advantage but still reflect the want in their own lives the ideas of the ruling class are the ruling class where the ruling material force is the ruling intellectual force

3250619 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
3250620 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3250626 the report by the congressional budget office according to people with knowledge of its contents will say that one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the united states military and other government agencies in a war zone where employees of private contractors now outnumber american troops
3250627 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3250628 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3250629 overbilling fraud and shoddy and unsafe work that has endangered and even killed american troops
3250630 the budget offices report found that from 2003 to 2007 the government awarded contracts in iraq worth about 85 billion and that the administration was now awarding contracts at a rate of 15 billion to 20 billion a year at that pace contracting costs will surge past the 100 billion mark before the end of the year through 2007 spending on outside contractors accounted for 20 percent of the total costs of the war the budget office found according to the people with knowledge of the report

3250635 it makes me a little bit nervous that he comes to my aid in an emergency it is definitely a concern that needs to be addressed
3250636 we have got to remember people are innocent until proven guilty but im not happy with the way the situation was handled melrose has a great volunteer fire department but this doesnt help their image
3250637 these people are responding to emergency type calls and i think just so there are no questions or problems he should have been put on leave i think thats the best thing and thats standard practice if someones arrested that they are put on leave pending the outcome

3250641 delgadillos complaint charges that chick used audits as opposition research to help unseat former mayor james hahn

3250690 it takes an entire community to address youth issues we need to create a culture where young people have hope
3250691 my career has pretty much been characterized by several themes
3250692 one is that we have an organization that has a culture around service to citizens
3250693 that we have a government that has a strong financial plan and maintains a strong financial status
3250694 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3250695 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3250696 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3250697 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3250698 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3250699 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process

3250735 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3250736 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3250737 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3250738 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3250739 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3250740 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3250741 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3250742 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3250743 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3250744 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3250745 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3250746 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3250747 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3250748 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3250749 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3250750 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3250751 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3250752 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3250753 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3250754 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3250755 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3250756 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3250757 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3250758 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3250759 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3250760 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3250761 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3250762 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3250766 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3250767 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3250769 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3250770 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3250771 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3250772 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3250773 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3250774 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3250775 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3250776 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3250784 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3250785 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3250786 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3250787 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3250788 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3250789 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3250790 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3250791 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3250792 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3250793 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3250794 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3250795 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

3250817 if you compare my driving to all the other pussies out there it probably is dirty but they all drive around like girl guides and whinge and carry on where i just leave it on the track
3250818 lucy and owain have been rowing all the time mainly because his career has really started to take off so he has been away from home a lot filming
3250819 right now she is a bit down and her weight has gone up everyone is hoping they can get things back on track
3250820 owains family were out visiting recently and witnessed how much strain their marriage is under and how unhappy lucy is they said she was just not herself and seemed vacant and sad
3250821 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3250822 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3250823 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3250824 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3250825 let it be a un mandated international force ideally eu
3250826 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3250827 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3250828 it was encouraging to win this test in kps first game in charge he has had a pretty good match although i am not totally convinced its the right way forward
3250829 but now hes captain he has got to be given a decent chance there has been a bit of an end of term feel to south africas cricket and theres a little bit of hollowness about this performance england still have a little way to go
3250830 he came from left field but they had to take a risk and try to be bold to take 20 wickets and win the match i cant fault them for that
3250831 andrew flintoff isnt good enough to bat at number six he doesnt have the technique and his footwork isnt good enough
3250832 his bowling is fantastic and the presence he brings to the side is great but you cant rely on him to score hundreds when flintoffs in the side it poses more questions than answers
3250833 bowlers are fresh and more likely to be able to take 20 wickets and you have to back your batsmen to score runs
3250834 if you are going to play five bowlers then bring back matt prior as the best batsman wicketkeeper to bat at six but if your wicketkeeper is going to bat at seven or eight then james foster is the best wicketkeeper
3250835 if you are putting your keeper in at six you are not getting to have your best wicketkeeper
3250836 you need contrasting players at the top of the order and we dont have that with strauss and cook
3250837 i like vaughan and cook as a combination and now with the burden of captaincy off his shoulders if vaughan can score runs in county cricket theres no reason why he cant come back to open the batting
3250838 simon has to prove he can bowl the amount of overs needed in a test match i am not sure hes done that at worcestershire this season because theyve been careful how they use him i think its still unknown whether he can do a hard test tour
3250839 kp has been fortunate to have them playing in unison something michael vaughan hadnt had for a while
3250840 if those two keep going then england can start moving forward but they have been beaten by a better side
3250841 i was excited when i found out i was selected
3250842 ill go meet new people from all over the u s and work on my leadership skills and how to work with people
3250843 i just love to run and being outside with my friends

3250877 it would be appropriate for the bed tax dollar to support the zoo with a logical business plan

3250879 if you rent a room on pensacola beach the tax is 141 2 percent while its 131 2 percent on navarre beach
3250880 if we raise the bed tax it will put taxes we levy on equal footing with escambia county and give us additional funds

3250884 for as long as anyone can remember the state has only funded us to transport children who live two miles or more from their schools with the exception of elementary children who would endure hazardous walking conditions as defined and certified by the state
3250885 im hoping the school board will come through and make some provisions
3250886 ive thought about pulling her out of school to home school her
3250887 i have so many memories i make so many friends while riding the bus
3250888 its funny last year i wished to walk to school as they say be careful what you wish
3250889 these children will be transported on a space available basis
3250890 a lot of those kids if its a rainy day they wont go to school we need to get them there
3250891 i wouldnt send my kid down kingsfield road and u s 29 we may have to spend some additional money for transportation
3250892 ultimately what we promise parents is that well provide a great education for their child
3250893 he is obviously a skilled politician with a long political history but i dont see that as a strike against me
3250894 its time to move forward with someone who has fresh ideas in county government
3250895 not one person has said keep the same people in office
3250896 i hear a lot of people feel they are disconnected from local government
3250897 they are ready for change they want new ideas new perspectives and new leadership
3250898 its like a household budget you have to understand it and not keep on spending until you get a handle on it

3250922 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
3250923 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us

3250925 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3250926 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3250927 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3250928 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3250929 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3250930 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3250931 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about

3250941 if anything it undermines the innovations when financial market players are operating in a totally wild west environment
3250942 weve seen again and again when you lose public trust its extremely difficult to re establish it
3250943 we have seen that in a moment of crisis institutions that never anticipated being able to access the discount window like investment banks have been given access
3250944 their behavior has not been subject to the kind of oversight required to protect taxpayers from these institutions taking excessive risks with ultimately the american peoples money
3250945 we ought to regulate the financial institutions by what theyre doing rather than by who they are
3250946 with far too little attention paid to the issues raised by the bear stearns rescue and the current financial crisis
3250947 even hardened free market types know that you cannot set up a situation where we know that if everything truly goes wrong we will once again open the discount window but not keep an eye on your behavior in the run up to that time
3250948 access to the discount window is by its nature temporary you only do it when everything else goes wrong and its a last resort

3250995 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
3250996 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings

3251023 westpac would know from its due diligence process the underlying performance of the group and so does the market
3251024 and then parallel to that weve also got the independent experts report being progressed as well

3251034 it was encouraging to win this test in kps first game in charge he has had a pretty good match although i am not totally convinced its the right way forward
3251035 but now hes captain he has got to be given a decent chance there has been a bit of an end of term feel to south africas cricket and theres a little bit of hollowness about this performance england still have a little way to go
3251036 he came from left field but they had to take a risk and try to be bold to take 20 wickets and win the match i cant fault them for that
3251037 andrew flintoff isnt good enough to bat at number six he doesnt have the technique and his footwork isnt good enough
3251038 his bowling is fantastic and the presence he brings to the side is great but you cant rely on him to score hundreds when flintoffs in the side it poses more questions than answers
3251039 bowlers are fresh and more likely to be able to take 20 wickets and you have to back your batsmen to score runs
3251040 if you are going to play five bowlers then bring back matt prior as the best batsman wicketkeeper to bat at six but if your wicketkeeper is going to bat at seven or eight then james foster is the best wicketkeeper
3251041 if you are putting your keeper in at six you are not getting to have your best wicketkeeper
3251042 you need contrasting players at the top of the order and we dont have that with strauss and cook
3251043 i like vaughan and cook as a combination and now with the burden of captaincy off his shoulders if vaughan can score runs in county cricket theres no reason why he cant come back to open the batting
3251044 simon has to prove he can bowl the amount of overs needed in a test match i am not sure hes done that at worcestershire this season because theyve been careful how they use him i think its still unknown whether he can do a hard test tour
3251045 kp has been fortunate to have them playing in unison something michael vaughan hadnt had for a while
3251046 if those two keep going then england can start moving forward but they have been beaten by a better side
3251047 why should i be mad moose is entitled to his opinion
3251048 since ive been here some receivers have gotten better bobby wade got better if he hadnt the titans wouldnt have given him the money and minnesota wouldnt have picked him up after that justin gage got better if he hadnt the titans wouldnt have given him 17 million bernard berrian when he was here he got better or minnesota wouldnt have given him 42 million
3251049 moose is a grown man he can say what he wants to say its not going to stop me from loving him i know whats in his heart i know how he feels about me and how i feel about him

3251051 i was going against the chiefs third team defense so theres not a lot to look into
3251052 ive had teammates calling me superstar and the whole things pretty cool but im not getting carried away
3251053 i know the coaches said i showed some poise showed some courage in there but i realize i have to keep improving if i want to be around
3251054 im getting better but the offense is pretty hard to learn for me progressing from college to pros
3251055 there are a lot more protections and audibles and just the dynamics of the things im not getting a ton of reps
3251056 every time hes gotten an opportunity we like what we see from him
3251057 hes still a young player and has a long way to go but that was a good start
3251058 there are some around me who may not notice much of a difference its something im just going to have to work on over time
3251059 if theres an opportunity to make ourselves better we arent afraid
3251060 its mainly the assistant general managers looking at the waiver wires and bringing things to the attention of the general manager theres a little backroom competitiveness going on and in some cases backroom spite you counter those with your own claims of that ilk

3251065 tengo problemas como los de cualquier persona como ustedes pero estoy preparado para superar esta etapa ya que uno como futbolista de esto vive de la gente la afici n la prensa que piden resultados y uno con o sin problemas personales debe de dar siempre el cien por ciento algo que no estoy logrando
3251066 creo que esta vez ha sido dif cil esta etapa no s lo porque no caen los goles pr cticamente no es el mismo miguel sabah en cuanto a lo futbol stico los goles pueden o no caer pero no me siento bien no he estado en mi mejor nivel y ha sido dif cil este comienzo en lo cr tico en lo personal pero como dicen los que saben de futbol esto pasa y lo importante es levantarse
3251067 por ello estoy tranquilo apoy ndome en la familia para salir de esta etapa y en el compa erismo incondicional del grupo para revertir esto y regresar a la alegr a y a los goles para la afici n que es lo que pide pero seguir trabajando aguantar cr ticas y chiflidos de la afici n pero pronto yo s me conozco me tengo confianza s que con trabajo y esfuerzo llegar el sabah luchador y goleador que tanto anhelo

3251073 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities

3251122 realmente no es nada nuevo ya hab a estado cantando y tocando la guitarra en grupos como the vendettas o the white lights y ahora tiger tiger que es quiz una combinaci n y mutaci n de esas dos bandas
3251123 me encantan ambas bandas pero son proyectos distintos clay y yo somos muy diferentes como m sicos y como int rpretes tenemos casi las mismas influencias pero la manera en que se reflejan es muy distinta es mucho m s intuitivo y org nico de lo que puedes pensar tiger tiger m s o menos ha evolucionado por lo que cada uno sus integrantes aporta a la banda musicalmente un organista rellena much simo e incluso canciones de tres acordes suenan muy potentes con el rgano me gusta el contraste de los dos proyectos en referencia a los puntos de partida tiger es una banda bastante poppy a todos nos gustan las canciones pegadizas pero creo que es importante subvertirlas en cierta manera ya sea usando un riff de guitarra disonante o mediante unas letras sorprendentes esta es una filosof a que comparten ambas bandas
3251124 yo fusilo a clay y siempre lo he hecho y clay fusila todo lo cool del mundo clay escribe casi todo lo que canta en los subsonics y yo escribo todas las letras y canto en tiger mi contribuci n musical en los subsonics es mantener a clay a raya es un tr o y si la secci n r tmica no atase en corto a mr freakout y le diese alguna patada en el culo l lo convertir a en una mezcla entre ravi shankar y ornette colleman
3251125 una trayectoria similar probablemente a la bala de la pistola de william s burroughs
3251126 no lo s pusieron los micr fonos y tocamos las canciones en una o dos tomas as es como hacemos los discos no es muy distinto de tocar en directo excepto que puedes rebobinar y arreglar los fallos
3251127 he de reconocer que soy una tremenda voyeur me encanta escuchar a la gente hablar de cosas y luego robarles sus experiencias para mis canciones como un s cubo ideas para las canciones pueden salir de cualquier lado de mi misma de alguien que conozco o de algo que he le do no hay restricciones acerca de d nde salen las ideas es simplemente mi interpretaci n de todo de dentro y de fuera

3251131 somos los mejores amigos muy ntimos los que est n cerca aprenden a apartarse un poco o comprarse un chaleco salvavidas clay y yo somos a prueba de balas en cualquier caso as que creo que deberemos empezar a usar navajas
3251132 sabes clay se cree que es invencible e indestructible ha tenido un mont n de accidentes en su vida y me imagino que ha tenido mucho da o cerebral no tengo ni idea como puede todav a recordar su nombre por no hablar de las letras de las canciones pero es genial siempre esta tocando y escribiendo creando canciones en su cabeza est escribiendo tres libros de historia psicolog a y una autobiograf a
3251133 no se si podr as llamarlas colaboraciones matt produjo un disco para clay en new york y entonces clay decidi que odiaba a otra gente tocando con l as que matt nunca sac el disco
3251134 ellos son muy simp ticos con nosotros y parece que aman a nuestro grupo pero no creo que seamos lo suficiente cercanos para que ninguno nos considere sus hermanos mayores pero nos tratan muy bien
3251135 la mierda siempre flota significa que nosotros no somos mierda tocaremos si a alguien le importa tanto como si no no necesitamos un p blico creo que es aqu donde rompemos el molde del show business en el negocio hay un falso concepto que dice que el int rprete y la audiencia se necesitan mutuamente a nosotros nos gusta nuestro p blico pero no lo necesitamos

3251140 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3251141 but as we have pointed out before those qv statistics are based on property settlements whereas ours are based on unconditional contracts so invevitably the earlier statistics relate to june sales reported in july
3251142 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people taking about a 10 per cent decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3251143 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3251144 northlands median price was back up after a big fall in june to 302 750 at 315 00 for july while waikato and the bay of plenty was up from 316 000 in june to 325 000 in july
3251145 hawkes bay provided particularly strong evidence of its recovery with an increase in the median price for the district from 216 000 to 282 000 while manawatu and wanganui were up from 213 750 to 233 750
3251146 taranaki was up from 255 000 to 265 000 and wellington was up from 366 500 in june to 371 000 in july
3251147 nelson and marlborough were again a little weaker with a median down from 335 000 in june to 330 000 but canterbury and westland recovered slightly from 299 000 to 300 000
3251148 central otago lakes district was up from 514 000 to 565 000 but on low sales while otago rallied from 225 000 in june to 240 000 in july
3251149 celebrating the academys 60th birthday will be an important part of this years emmy show but we wanted to do it in a way that tied several generations of televisions past to the present

3251166 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare

3251168 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3251169 do we want to live in a society that controls even our basic right to have children why do we support an organization that not only encourages that control but requires it of nations prior to giving them needed funds since that is their stance what will happen to all of us if they ever gain control why are we allowing our tax dollars to foster such repressive policies

3251171 today this nation lies in economic ruins devastated and destitute in much the same dire straits in which germany and japan found themselves in 1945 will americans act to rebuild our nation as germany and japan have done when they faced the identical conditions which we now face or will we continue to be enslaved by the draconian debt money system which was set up by the federal reserve act of 1913 to complete our total destruction this is the only question which we have to answer and we do not have much time left to answer it

3251186 this developed as the investment environment turned more cautious due to concerns about global financial market fragilities and the downturn in many advanced economies including the us
3251187 whats happening to the dollar has to do with a shift in relative growth and interest rate expectations
3251188 the currencies that have come under the most pressure especially over the last three or four days have been those where until recently inflation concerns dominated and now the slowdown in the global economy has generated a shift lower in interest rate expectations
3251189 the current price rises arent driven by strong demand so will be a drag on corporate and household activity its a negative for japans economy
3251190 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies in the second half of the year
3251191 dollar asia was strong yesterday and today i think a lot of players were stopped out
3251192 the combination of broad us dollar strength downward growth revisions to asia and a rebalancing of fx policy bias away from inflation prevention to growth promotion has prompted us to revise our asia fx forecasts

3251194 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia

3251196 establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
3251197 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3251198 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3251199 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
3251200 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3251201 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate russia cannot play a constructive role as peacekeeper

3251206 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3251207 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3251215 the vast majority of our media dollars are going to go there
3251216 were buying the front page and were also buying the political forums
3251217 the political forum section is probably the best way of reaching people voting in the primary
3251218 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3251219 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3251223 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3251224 deposit rates are market driven and more dynamic we can change it later as well

3251267 how can she be a doctor and threaten to kill people
3251268 i asked her do you need help she said yes
3251269 we said let the girl go and well leave we told them stop
3251270 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her i got a bottle smashed over my head and after that i started fighting but i got beat down
3251271 when i showed up there were a lot of people there people on the left and people on the right and then boom i got hit and passed out
3251272 american students experience greater amounts of stress because of the unclear goals provided by their families and society
3251273 the single most important goal they seek is a devotion to their schoolwork
3251274 one of my fondest memories was during the winter of 1954 when my mom and i left our house and walked to the park on a very cold night to go ice skating we walked through the long meadow through the ravine to the boathouse and felt perfectly safe
3251275 its where i learned to play baseball its where i had my first date prospect park was my countryside
3251276 its a wonderful reminder of why we love this park and why it means so much to the people of brooklyn
3251277 i took a train over to brooklyn and found myself in front of public school 39 where i went to elementary school and decided to do a documentary about the school
3251278 the people who use the park now are much more diverse than they were when i was growing up
3251279 but the park is in many ways the same it maintains the gauzy romantic sylvan setting that i remember from my childhood
3251280 how depressing the park was in the late 60s and early 70s it looked like a bomb had hit it now to see how beautiful it is it looks like a rebirth what the alliance has done is incredible
3251281 i still think of it as a refuge from the city
3251282 its not like it happened on its own this is after the city took direct action to rezone this community
3251283 downtown brooklyn is one of the fastest growing urban centers in
3251284 the downtown brooklyn partnership works to connect small business owners with available resources and appropriate service providers
3251285 when so many people were evicted from the mall you had so many people trying to reach out and find the nearest location so landlords took advantage
3251286 its not easy for a business to get up and leave
3251287 we want the developers to give back to small businesses who made it desirable land for the city
3251288 we built it in the last 25 years and now its their profit and our loss
3251289 i strongly believe in pride of business economic development but if that means displacing the roots of the community i believe its not right
3251290 i lost my friends my longtime clientele employees some of them worked for me for 15 years
3251291 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate
3251292 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3251293 it sounded very totalitarian i thought it sounded undemocratic and i was completely shocked
3251294 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3251295 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee
3251296 if someone brings you private correspondence youll use that in investigating a complaint
3251297 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3251298 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3251299 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3251300 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3251301 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up
3251302 you must fill your plates with vegetables first they should take up half the plate leaving a quarter of the plate for a starch and a quarter for your meat
3251303 you can have rice you can have bread you can have macaroni but not all in the same meal and only in appropriate portion sizes
3251304 we decided it would be fun to go to atlantic city together too well do a little gambling a little shopping and well have our regular class on the boardwalk
3251305 if people ask us about what were doing well have diabetes literature to give them
3251306 there are lots of other people who might not be as aware as they should
3251307 i was eating wrong i was always upset i was in ignorance and pain for such a long time
3251308 i havent been on a trip in a very long time
3251309 there were about twenty who decided to attack our officers
3251310 if lcrosss booster stage hits a patch of lunar regolith that contains at least 0 5 percent water ice water should be detectable in the plume of ejecta
3251311 the first and most important criterion is that we think the impact area will be productive from an ejecta standpoint
3251312 if we dont get ejecta into sunlight it wouldnt matter if we hit an iceberg because we would never know it
3251313 weve gone through essentially every possible launch date and picked a crater for each date
3251314 it really is going to turn into an international event
3251315 everyones going to be training their eyes on the impact to observe it
3251316 and this is why i dont like you at my house because you dont care about anyone but yourself
3251317 you know jordin you really hurt me feelings blah blah blah
3251318 i began by saying that our history will be what we make it if we go on as we are then history will take its revenge and retribution will not limp in catching up with us we are to a large extent an imitative society if one or two or three corporations would undertake to devote just a small traction of their advertising appropriation along the lines that i have suggested the procedure would grow by contagion the economic burden would be bearable and there might ensue a most exciting adventure exposure to ideas and the bringing of reality into the homes of the nation to those who say people wouldnt look they wouldnt be interested theyre too complacent indifferent and insulated i can only reply there is in one reporters opinion considerable evidence against that contention but even if they are right what have they got to lose because if they are right and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain amuse and insulate then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost this instrument can teach it can illuminate yes and it can even inspire but it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box
3251319 after trying my luck with various north american teams i decided to look northward at my canadian friends none of them are fat and few are american im hoping to play with these good looking people at some upcoming lans as well as any online leagues they are very talented and have lots of french nades which converts into wins
3251320 of course sir come right in and ill have some ice water brought right up
3251321 yeah sure theres a pump over there come on in
3251322 the man down the road said that was heaven too
3251323 oh you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates nope thats hell
3251324 doesnt it make you mad for them to use your name like that
3251325 no were just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave their best friends behind

3251356 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was difficult for the others to see me
3251357 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3251358 i just wanted to win the race win the heat i wanted to set everything up for tomorrow
3251359 i looked up and saw matt grevers next to me i was elated stuff like that is like a dream come true
3251360 i remember what it felt like after the 100m backstroke i broke down and that will probably happen here it is just as wonderful as the first time
3251361 it hasnt sunk in yet when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake it was a very fast time
3251362 i was a bit disappointed hopefully ill have the rest of the day to chill out and focus
3251363 im just unsure about how long its going to last and hoping that it will be resolved soon

3251376 ted solotaroffs taste in fiction has proved to be something of a national resource
3251377 it was the great regret of his life that he didnt push harder to keep it going
3251378 was pushing hard to shut it down it wasnt bringing in the novels that would grow out of these pieces being published in the journal
3251379 that sort of driving energy that established the jewish middle class
3251380 in the league i played in now the jewish one the high scoring was in english math social studies and science
3251381 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
3251382 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue
3251383 a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
3251384 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3251385 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3251386 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3251387 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3251388 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3251389 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3251390 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3251391 drunken and loutish holidaymakers have sent britains reputation abroad plunging to new depths
3251392 it is the funniest thing youve ever seen but also the most dangerous thing
3251393 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go

3251395 the atomic bomb was dropped in japan and so here i was dual rated with no war to fight
3251396 the public has a right to know where were going
3251397 when i graduated high school mohawk 2001 i went to a factory first
3251398 but everyone sort of helps out inside for the collections
3251399 we try to keep a day between collecting the big bulls
3251400 but some days they just might not want to jump and might not want to work
3251401 sometimes it might take an hour to get one bull to drop
3251402 we try to keep a supply but sometimes theres not a chance to keep a supply
3251403 the majority of them are right are around 2 400 2 500
3251404 one out of 10 will move back here for production
3251405 the two bigger facilities might get 60 70 at a time
3251406 every country has different health requirements its a lot of paperwork
3251407 as far as im concerned theyve been great all season
3251408 the offense always steps it up away from home and the way weve been playing as a team lately we know this is an important stretch
3251409 when you walk in the stadium is gigantic its almost breathtaking to see how big it is its just jam packed with people too and its just surreal
3251410 its a very humbling experience walking in there and realizing this is the biggest stage in the world and millions of people are watching what youre doing
3251411 it was kind of out of nowhere because they called me about a month before and said they werent going to take me they were going to take some older guys
3251412 i was in birmingham and i thought the team had already left but then scott got called up to the big leagues and i guess i was next on their list
3251413 so it was kind of a mixed feeling i didnt know if i was going to go
3251414 i wanted to stick around but its tough to pass up a chance to go to the olympics
3251415 ive been dreaming about this since i was playing for the junior team in 02 when we went to sherbrooke so i just couldnt pass up the opportunity it was a once in a lifetime deal
3251416 especially with baseball being out of the olympics in 2012 with this being the last shot deal i decided id better go
3251417 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3251418 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3251419 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3251420 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3251421 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3251422 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3251423 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3251424 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3251425 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3251426 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3251427 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3251428 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3251429 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3251430 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3251431 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3251432 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3251433 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3251434 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3251435 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3251436 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3251437 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3251438 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3251439 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3251440 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3251441 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3251442 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3251443 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3251444 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
3251445 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3251446 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

3251449 encuentro continental de pueblos y nacionalidades ind genas del abya yala
3251450 si usted fracasa fracasamos todos los ind genas del mundo
3251451 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

3251453 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3251454 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3251455 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3251457 we will have access to more accurate and more rapid information to enable us to issue a tsunami alert
3251458 within 30 seconds around 90 percent of the information reaches the tsunami warning centre in tokyo the average speed for other systems is around 180 seconds
3251459 they were also worried about the fluctuating global oil and raw material prices and stock market turbulence
3251460 the slowdown in other economies has weakened the demand for chinese products
3251461 meanwhile the value of imports has jumped on surging international commodities prices even if the volume may have remained roughly the same
3251462 clearly policymakers have come to a conclusion that their focus will shift from simply curbing inflation in the previous months to both containing inflation and maintaining fast economic growth
3251463 the producer price index rose quite fast which poses a rather big threat
3251464 the interest rate will definitely have to be raised although china is trying to delay the next hike
3251465 its like you build a dam to fend off inflation but it will collapse when the problem gets too big
3251466 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3251467 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3251468 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3251469 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3251470 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves
3251471 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3251472 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3251473 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3251474 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
3251475 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming
3251476 however the ongoing steps to improve ties with mainland china will not influence taiwans proposed procurement of us made weaponry
3251477 as a matter of fact taiwan presented an arms shopping list to the united states last year we hope the us authorities could review the list in accordance with their law
3251478 not because of below ground resource constraints but because of inadequate investment by international oil companies and national oil companies
3251479 the willingness of the iocs to invest is constrained by the adoption of value based management as a financial strategy thus they are returning investment funds to shareholders rather than investing in the industry for the nocs willingness is driven by depletion policy increasingly this is motivated by a view that oil in the ground is worth more than money in the bank
3251480 many producer countries are also experiencing a resurgence of resource nationalism which excludes iocs from helping to develop capacity
3251481 in some cases the structure of the oil sector militates against its ability to develop the countrys reserves finally in many cases rising domestic oil consumption is eating into the ability to export
3251482 even saudi arabia whose record on capacity expansion plans has been superb is facing questions over its ability to deliver
3251483 the khursaniyah expansion which was due on stream at the end of 2007 is now expected in mid 2009
3251484 part of the reason for this poor performance is that the natural decline rates in the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development fields have taken analysts by surprise
3251485 furthermore in many of the deepwater fields where much of the new non opec capacity is coming on stream maintaining production is difficult because operations such as in fill drilling are much more complicated and far more expensive than in traditional oil fields
3251486 energy policy needs to reduce the demand growth of liquid fuels to increase the supply of conventional liquids or to increase the supply of unconventional liquids
3251487 only extreme policy measures could achieve a speedy response and these are usually politically unpopular any major price spike would carry a macro economic impact which would of itself provoke a policy reaction
3251488 might break down opposition to a much greater interventionist approach by governments in their energy sectors thus it might do for energy policy what 9 11 did for u s military and security policy
3251489 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3251490 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3251491 the traffic jams are very serious and many vehicles and passengers are stuck
3251492 local inhabitants face many difficulties because there is not enough food
3251493 two more bodies have been recovered they had been swept away in the strong currents
3251494 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function from that observation we have suspected that there may be a large number of people in the general population who carry pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations but who are not obviously ill with a mitochondrial disease this study gives us for the first time a measurement of the number of these carriers of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the general population one in every 200 individuals is a lot of people around 1 5 million people in the united states alone
3251495 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation
3251496 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3251497 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3251498 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3251499 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3251500 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3251501 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3251502 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3251503 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3251504 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3251505 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3251506 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3251507 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3251508 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3251509 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3251510 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3251511 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3251512 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3251513 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3251514 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3251515 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3251516 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
3251517 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
3251518 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3251519 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3251520 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
3251521 me gust mucho las caricaturas quedaron excelentes pusieron los mejores factores de cada uno estoy muy contento

3251523 the suspect immediately jumped from the taxi wielding a straight razor in his hand officers j bloodworth j c banks and j r moore who were in the parking lot closest to the suspect began to challenge the suspect to drop his weapon the suspect refused to follow the commands of the officers and began yelling that he was not going to jail and that the officers were going to have to kill him
3251524 from his vantage point officer bloodworth thought that officer moore had been injured
3251525 it is a small gesture to help patients and families feel more at home and provide a touch of color and joy in a difficult time
3251526 one of our board members approached him last year and he agreed to participate and bring some of his friends
3251527 teresa shaw executive director of the boys amp girls club called and asked if id be involved i told her anything i could do to help out id be glad to do i wouldnt have wanted to grow up anywhere in the world besides rocky mount there was no way i could turn her down
3251528 for someone whos lived such a celebrated life that boy who grew up in rocky mount is still there
3251529 we havent taken the fun out but were looking at what we can do to help them help themselves after the games are over
3251530 what we can do to make them a positive influence on their communities and keep them out of harms way
3251531 were operating a new system that is paying about 90 000 people
3251532 we feel like weve done an outstanding job with it
3251533 i feel like im damaged and im on the verge of getting an attorney
3251534 north carolina is leading the fight for clean air because its critical to our health and our economy
3251535 our petition to the epa coupled with our lawsuit against tva can reduce significantly the air pollution coming into our state from coal fired utility smokestacks
3251536 now that the court has struck down the cair rules our petition is even more important not only to north carolina but to the southeastern united states
3251537 pollution doesnt respect state boundaries pollution blows across all of the southeastern u s this will help other states as well
3251538 we just want to get it back on track and get it resolved
3251539 there is no point in expending either the courts or the parties resources on these cases until epa can determine if it will need to re evaluate its decision on north carolinas petition
3251540 i always involve the family in these types of decisions
3251541 he had been seen with that weapon prior to this crime and he has been seen with that weapon after the crime
3251542 the state believes she was probably abducted perhaps just outside her home
3251543 if this was my mom or this was my sister id be all for giving him the death penalty
3251544 i certainly would support no hope for ever getting out of prison
3251545 they deserve to get the death penalty but they also deserve to spend some time thinking about what theyve done
3251546 thats worse than death every day youve got to think about what you did to that girl
3251547 for the last couple of years theyve taken hundreds of millions of dollars
3251548 this is money they charged us for gas taxes its supposed to be for roads they keep taking it away
3251549 you never mentioned the way the governor has robbed the funds collected from gas tax and licensing fees to help balance the general budget
3251550 i think if they never had that 170 million transfer and wed had that 170 million over time for transportation wed still be having this conversation today
3251551 i still think they need to move their mobile homes to property that they own
3251552 just because were not moving forward doesnt mean someone else cant come up with a plan
3251553 they keep saying theyre here to help you but theyre only here to kick you out
3251554 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3251555 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3251556 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3251557 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3251558 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3251559 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3251560 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3251561 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3251562 one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3251563 they just disappeared he just noticed at some point that they werent there any more he didnt think much of of it because he hardly knew them

3251574 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3251575 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3251576 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3251577 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3251578 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3251579 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police
3251580 this is the best period in history in terms of education medical care and religion
3251581 tell us where you want more information and well drill it down further
3251582 they suffer every day i see the suffering their families go through this is just one less thing to have on their plate
3251583 the major concern we have is the incomplete and sometimes cursory treatment of these issues in the draft statement
3251584 how easy it is to get around much easier than i anticipated in a city this size
3251585 the kind of projects the meals tax would help fund would really help make the community a more special place
3251586 these quality of life events and quality of life facilities tend to put communities over the top
3251587 it takes an entire community to address youth issues we need to create a culture where young people have hope
3251588 my career has pretty much been characterized by several themes
3251589 one is that we have an organization that has a culture around service to citizens
3251590 that we have a government that has a strong financial plan and maintains a strong financial status
3251591 you cant accredit an entity you dont know anything about
3251592 it certainly hasnt helped anyone that this situation has occurred
3251593 did not use proper techniques to de escalate an agitated patient and failed to notify the patients guardian in a timely manner
3251594 cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces
3251595 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3251596 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3251597 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3251598 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3251599 hes an amazing hitter he can help any offense out no doubt about it im glad to have him here
3251600 he puts up some amazing power numbers you know hes going to hit some home runs and he brings us some excitement to the game as well
3251601 hes a guy that produces a lot of runs he draws some walks and has a good on base percentage i dont know where theyre going to stick him but wherever it is hes going to do some damage
3251602 at this point in time simply making any personnel adjustments that inevitably will lead to us winning ballgames im all for it
3251603 im looking forward to adam simply doing what he does and contributing for us down the stretch and inevitably helping support us win a division title
3251604 i didnt know we were trying to build a basketball team
3251605 weve got the biggest team in the history of baseball

3251608 china is a closed society so nbc is essentially opening doors for the other parts of ge
3251609 for those reasons the olympics are working out quite well for ge
3251610 the ratings have been generally higher than what people thought
3251611 there is certainly a core audience for the olympics but there also is a tremendous interest in china
3251612 besides that the economy is lousy gas is too expensive and people are taking fewer vacations that might make them amenable to stay home and watch something where they can root for the athletes
3251613 we expect a profit here but its still too early to tell exactly where it is going to be
3251614 just one of the many benefits of having nbc as part of the ge portfolio

3251808 three dimensional printers often called rapid prototypers assemble objects out of an array of specks of material just as traditional printers create images out of dots of ink or toner they build models in a stack of very thin layers each created by a liquid or powdered plastic that can be hardened in small spots by precisely applied heat light or chemicals
3251809 3d printing is a technique that deposites material layer by layer using a head similar to that of a inkjet printer the head tends to move along the x and y axes and the object being printed moves up and down on the z axis
3251810 in the last few years rapid prototyping has become more automated and much cheaper machines suitable for offices and academic environments have appeared on the market and have been christened 3d printers a range of different rp technologies exist and two companies have come to dominate the market stratasys amp zcorp a quality 3d printer from either of these two will cost in the order of 30 000 each has its advantages but to me the color capabilities of the zcorp 510 makes this easily the most desirable machine it is the machine currently used by the majority of the top uk 3d print bureaus also bristol fine print research have a couple of zcorp machines if you had a larger budget 100 000 then you could look to go to the high end rapid prototyping machines again from stratasys which can build to a much larger size and precision and also use a bigger variety of build mediums there are also some cheap and cheerful approaches you could take with a budget of a few thousand pound s

3251908 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3251909 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3251910 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3251911 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3251912 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3251913 yes little man i do want to play with you

3251934 i second jakuas in this case google has been keen to implement
3251935 i think such a blog is extremely viable for the market
3251936 i did reference it didnt you say you wrote about movies and your kids oh i just confused thats all
3251937 anyway people who read your blog will know that i just made a mistake thats all
3251938 lheny the main damage is in the newspapers thats where the big readership is isnt it
3251939 ive seen some long titles performing better than short ones in google lately if user search a 3 words keyprase in most cases you find
3251940 even as a content analysis factor i think density is a webmasters tool but not a direct part of the algorithm so it wouldnt surprise me that its not a factor in title tag relevance either
3251941 i dont think matching exactly query have a downside itself but i think google scores long titles better than short ones even in cases like described 100 acurracy on searched term but its just my guessing and agree with seo ploy but to be honest in competitive search terms even important sites try to get 1 position tweaking title no matter if title does really represent the content fairly
3251942 the rationale for rewarding longer titles could be a better user experience instant understanding of a web pages content is more easily possible through a longer title usually i dont know if i believe in keyword density for improved ranking but i suspect spam keyword density could be counted to kick a site down i suspect google checks spam anchor text density for its 950 penalty
3251943 perhaps patent rewards longer titles with a 60 70 density better than less than 4 words 100 density considering fact keyphrases do not go over 3 words in most cases to disencourage the seo practice to target exactly what users find making titles

3251947 i havent heard anything about interest from any team so this surprises me it is always nice to hear that someone is interested in you that they appreciate you
3251948 but i just want to concentrate on my team rangers
3251949 i saw the game on tuesday night but i had no doubts about having signed
3251950 when you come here you know that rangers will play every season in europe and its a dream for the players
3251951 i was very disappointed sitting in my room it was raining and i didnt feel good
3251952 afterwards it was brighter and i thought my contract is four years and we will win the championship and there will be no worries
3251953 of course european football was a big reason for me coming here
3251954 i saw the uefa cup final last year and i knew that there would be the chance of champions league football every year so it was a dream
3251955 i want to play in the champions league next year
3251956 gus macpherson was not even mentioned nor was his face up on any screen what we do is look at video clips and dvds and look at the good bad and ugly part of the game to see what we want to improve upon
3251957 one of the clips we used was of a tackle in a scottish cup game between rangers and hibernian and how the two managers walter smith and mixu paatelainen had got involved as a result of that
3251958 we were looking at the repercussions of the tackle we were not specifically looking at managers and that was the only time we talked about them and gus macpherson wasnt one of them

3252001 from a bottom of rs 780 ongc is already rs 1 110 yesterday it can still push up to about rs 1 136 and rs 1 159 the risk reward ratio for a buy is not in favour of you now most things have rallied so it is not beneficial to buy now if you have bought already take some profit
3252002 we are very bullish on banks we believe the reasons for which the bank stocks have come down for that reasons actually they should be bought now for next year we strongly believe that crude price would be high double digit in the dollar terms and that would reduce the fiscal deficit and the subsidy burden of the government and also we believe that the rbi reserve bank of india with the swiftness they have raised their rates they will also be cutting the rates with the same swiftness next year when the inflation comes under control
3252003 the monsoon as of now which was lacking now 32 out of 36 that is about 90 of places the monsoon is normal according to imd indian meteorological department and our understanding is that inflation will start moderating from november onwards should that happen then there is every possibility of interest rates to come down the 10 year bond is actually is showing inverted term structure the bond market is actually anticipating lower inflation and lower interest rates going forward hence banks stocks would do well going forward and some of the banks have come down so much for example the icici bank or sbi or bank of india these are the banks which we are pushing very aggressively to our clients
3252004 there is some upside still left in dlf unitech if unitech can cross rs 194 today i think it is going towards an rs 210 level and dlf should go to about rs 590 so there is some upside still left even jp associates will probably rally up to about rs 217 indiabulls real estate should go to about rs 420 levels so that sector if you are day trader and you are booking some profits into something else you want to reorganize your portfolio maybe purely as a trading bet i would probably go long and be positive about the real estate just for a pullback
3252005 we have been very vocal about l amp t for some time acc and nagarjuna construction are there in our buy list but we like l amp t
3252006 on bhel we are negative but off late we have seen a lot of protectionism coming from the government side because earlier our negativism came because of most of the ultra mega power projects getting their plans from china but now a lot of noise we are seeing that if somebody uses chinese power plants they wont be getting the co linkage etc so that actually helps bhel so there is a case for bhel one can get positive and the prices are also quite comfortable so we believe that there is at least rs 300 to rs 400 that one can make in this stock from these levels

3252009 presently the stock is trading at rs 845 which is at 22 47 times to its earnings and 6 70 times to its book value of rs 126 01 since the stock seems to offers extremely good investment opportunities we initiate a buy signal on the stock with a target price of rs 1036 in medium to long term investment horizon expecting an appreciation of about 22 from the current level of rs 845

3252071 awarding the olympics to china was certainly motivated and inspired by a noble idea but the experiment has failed
3252072 china is not any more open or transparent or democratic and from the looks of it it may actually take a few steps backwards after the games are over
3252073 im not sure thats going to last because olympic season has just started

3252306 we make a strong appeal just to help us out because were going through a hard time and we just hope that our son is back home i just wish someones helping him out and not harming him at all
3252307 i dont want to lose hope not to find him again
3252308 i dont want to lose that hope i just want him back home
3252309 i just believe that maybe he tried to disobey his mother and just didnt want to wait to go to the park
3252310 thats the first time that hes tried to do that unfortunately and just went off and maybe tried to get a train or a tram
3252311 i dont even think about that part of the park because i didnt even know that there was a creek there
3252312 and i know the police officers are trying to do their best to wipe out all the doubts but because it was pretty cold i dont think hell be going there
3252313 the place where he tries to go all the time theres a childrens corner he used to go there and hes very fascinated by that
3252314 hes quite an open child he likes to smile to anybody he speaks hes not so timid
3252315 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3252316 i believe it will be a very tough competition were up for it
3252317 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3252318 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3252319 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3252320 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3252321 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3252322 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3252323 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3252324 if elected a liberal government will repeal labors soft cannabis laws
3252325 i certainly remember it in barcelona there were those tanks outside every olympic family hotel and certainly that was the case in 76 and the case in 80
3252326 we are convinced the most reprobate whites in america breed here in texas
3252327 but their racism and perversion will not go unpunished for our god has something terrible planned for them and has shared his secret and the date with us

3252354 the empty seats are a challenge for us and we are trying to manage that

3252361 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3252362 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3252363 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3252364 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3252365 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3252366 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3252367 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3252368 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3252369 it is the funniest thing youve ever seen but also the most dangerous thing
3252370 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go
3252371 its only a matter of time before someone is killed
3252372 an unfriendly area where 70 to 75 of the local population was involved in drug trafficking
3252373 of the 100 people 70 75 of them were drug traffickers according to the border patrol and
3252374 my understanding is that this is totally against the rules of engagement
3252375 as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws
3252376 if there was any way to fix it i would
3252377 personally i dont think this kid ever saw them by the indication my rangers are telling me
3252378 rules on the use of force by dod personnel providing support to law enforcement agencies conducting counterdrug operations in the united states
3252379 in the future we certainly both want to have kids
3252380 weve been together eight years we want to win a gold medal then have kids
3252381 there are a lot of mothers playing pro beach volleyball they all came back stronger and happier i hope to be pregnant soon after the olympics take a year off and come back

3252397 thats the only way kids will be able to learn the skills theyll need to take care of themselves when they become adults
3252398 there have always been parents who would fit the definition of helicopter parents they used to be called overprotective parents but the idea of parents who hover over their children to shield them from possible distress is as old as parenting
3252399 questioning is not bad as long as parents are willing to listen and there is true dialogue

3252404 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes you think its gonna be a fun video game but real centipedes if they bite you its like getting shot with a bullet its that painful
3252405 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find

3252417 there are no more mysteries about the toronto situation as it pertains to next season
3252418 during the stanley cup playoffs i heard and read agent j
3252419 it has to be as obvious to mats as it is to all of us that the leafs are going down a different path with very few of the core players in recent years guys that he went to war with so mats knows pretty much everything he has to about the toronto situation as j p was requesting a few months ago the fact he hasnt yet re signed with the leafs indicates to me that he has no real enthusiasm to go back and i believe he still wants to play plus i think he knows the leafs cannot change much if he does return but thats just my opinion i have no indication either way whats on his mind
3252420 i know what cliff is trying to do because it falls in line with his entire plan re shaping the meat of the roster
3252421 but im not sure fletcher is making the right decision by letting bryan go i still think hes a very talented player maybe the best on the current leafs team and like you i think he makes tomas kaberle a better defenseman but its obvious that cliff feels he has to move forward without mccabe
3252422 i think the leafs are going to be better than you are predicting
3252423 the guys that i believe will step forward are the returnees players like alexei ponikarovsky nik antropov alex steen and jason blake
3252424 im really fond of paul maurice as a person and a coach and i believe hell get back in to the nhl
3252425 i also think jamal mayers will play an important role i know his acquisition sort of goes against the youth movement but the leafs obviously need some veteran players and he sure isnt afraid to mix it up the fans will like him
3252426 i dont know how many games hell play next season but i guarantee you the leafs will give luke schenn a chance at some point
3252427 i just loved watching that kid play in the whl and i think the leafs got the best defenseman in the entire draft it wouldnt surprise me at all if he showed a great deal of poise in his first nhl shot if he pans out the way im anticipating hell be an extremely popular player in toronto
3252428 as much as i respect curtis joseph i dont think hell see more than 15 games in relief

3252444 the strength in exports should help china regain its confidence in allowing the yuan to continue to appreciate on a trade weighted basis
3252445 the relationship between supply and demand is fairly balanced and competition in the market for finished products is very tough
3252446 so it will be hard for factory gate inflation which is being driven up by resource costs to pass through quickly to consumer prices
3252447 our assessment is that the inflation rate remains high but we are much less worried about the outlook
3252448 inflation is coming off and oil prices are coming down

3252452 when used correctly dextromethorphan containing medicines have a 50 year history of being safe and effective
3252453 but when abused in extreme excess dextromethorphan can produce dangerous side effects especially when combined with alcohol illicit drugs or certain prescription drugs
3252454 while surveys show that overall illicit drug use among youth is on a downward trend unfortunately the rates of over the counter and prescription drug abuse are holding steady
3252455 designating august as national medicine abuse awareness month will help bring this issue to the radar screen and i hope community organizations take advantage of this opportunity to raise awareness about this dangerous trend

3252459 the us is also trying to handle this issue properly

3252471 he urged nigerians who wish to travel abroad to do so through legal means adding that it is the sole prerogative of the embassies to grant visa
3252472 we have heard frightening stories of mothers who encourage their beautiful daughters to go into prostitution in foreign lands we also wonder that men of god hardly ask questions about the source of money that worshippers bring into the churches or mosques what they consider important is that the money has come
3252473 the problem of irregular migration had gone past the level government to government or legislating on
3252474 the leadership of bwari area council has provided the command which was upgraded in 2006 with more office accommodation and it also refurbished the offices
3252475 at bwari our ancestors had prayed for us that anybody that steps into the area will get so many blessings so we rejoice with the officers on their promotion
3252476 lot of people are talking about emigrating but few actually are
3252477 there is a small percentage of people who do end up selling and emigrating
3252478 we have 31000 properties listed on our website up from 22000 a year ago
3252479 people in distress are making up the majority of sellers these people keep their properties listed there are those who want to sell and those who need to sell
3252480 the ones who need to sell and who are bringing their prices in line with current market conditions are finding buyers some people who wanted to sell are taking their properties off the market because they cant achieve their asking prices
3252481 that makes sense because the amount of properties being absorbed taken up by buyers into the market at the moment is less than what was being absorbed last year
3252482 place the sale of their property as the most important aspect of their decision making process
3252483 you have the patriotic duty to ensure technology transfer to help make nigeria one of the foremost countries in the world by 2020
3252484 your new status as bona fide citizens of nigeria confers on you the fundamental rights privileges and immunities applicable to any nigerian by descent
3252485 nigerian constitution allows dual citizenship you are therefore permitted to retain the citizenship of your respective countries of birth or descent

3252489 it was the same test at the same hospital as before
3252490 from january 10 this year i was put on a regimen of medication that requires direct observation but that was not done
3252491 they were admitted in to the nigerian community after they have met the entire constitutional and administrative requirement involved in the grant of nigerian citizenship by naturalization or registration
3252492 influential us journal says gma sank rp into morass of corruption
3252493 everyday as a journalist its part of my daily regimen to check the news web sites and see what our paper published and what other papers publish were all rivals in the field so we want to know what the other papers are doing
3252494 the other writer could just deny it it was the principal responsibility of my paper it was in the papers best interest to protect its reporters
3252495 he said he had a photographic memory and what he read eventually found its way in his columns
3252496 if there are exact quotations from a published work without attribution its a sure sign that there was plagiarism in alecks case there were entire portions lifted from his article its an important issue with academia and journalism its the theft of somebodys work
3252497 in journalism where did this info come from any information that is not self evident should be attributed does the journalist have personal knowledge who is the source the source has to be cited
3252498 its easier to do it now because of the availability of information on the internet before journalists had to go to the library and look through books and old newspapers to get any information now you can just use your computer to copy and paste entire portions of text
3252499 every beat reporter knows about the ponente system in certain beats one writer is asked to write the story for everyone else its plagiarism by consensus the beat reporters pick up the story and make a few minor changes before passing it on to their editors some get caught because the stories that come out in the dailies are the same
3252500 if the original story has errors then everyone who copies it multiplies the mistakes it poisons the well of information and institutionalizes errors
3252501 he had to be more enterprising to fill the quota for reporters you dont have to go with the flow its much harder to write the stories but you do it the more ethical way and you serve the readers better
3252502 you have to establish a firm connection between training and practice one of the ways to do that is to improve the training of journalists
3252503 its a deception against the readers you are not giving the readers the entire truth its a betrayal of the trust between the journalist and the reader
3252504 journalism in the philippines tends to be an old boys club where you dont want to rock the boat you dont want to antagonize anyone in the profession you dont want to quarrel with another editor
3252505 it lowers the standard of performance we tend not to demand too much somebody copies something well thats a minor thing and its a form of condonation i think the standards of writing of any kind should be the same whether its journalism or in academia
3252506 increase the value of the variable cnt by 1 unless cnt is greater than or equal to 5 or is not a number in that case set cnt to 0

3252517 ohhhh well sir i dont know what we can do for you we have cribs here but you cant return this product here as its not from this store

3252521 engrossed in catalogue oh wow its says here this one folds down for easy storage

3252523 yes you see in the picture the crib is black
3252524 ah yes clever that how the pictures go along with the words
3252525 oh i havent asked yet i guess ill find out when its delivered
3252526 never mind sir so do you know what type of crib you want
3252527 this one with the liquor bottles and the shot glasses
3252528 thats a bar sir i think your wife might have a problem with that as well
3252529 you havent met her hehehe turns to woman hey tits what do you think
3252530 whoa if i had a face like that id look out for the farmer
3252531 of course you do simon busy busy man tell you what you pop out the back and grab the cheapest crib you can find i think ill stop at the track on the way home
3252532 at least with those horse faces i could have a win hey hehehe get it ah forget it your turn tits gestures to woman in line grabs crib and kennel and walks out of store
3252533 people do love the cinema but it is an old building and well passed its sell by date
3252534 rigorous tests must be applied to any proposal for the demolition of a listed building and the authority has requested further information from the applicant before officers are able to consider this application
3252535 i do catch myself realizing where normally in college i would have a guy pushed off thats the end of the play but hes coming back in the nfl and finishing his block
3252536 so mentally knowing the play is not over until its over is important for any rookie
3252537 for a big guy he can get slippery at times but we also have to make sure that for a big guy they feel his mass
3252538 and we dont always want the big guy to be slippery they have to feel 335 pounds crushing into you
3252539 all he has to do is see his first 10 plays when his body was fresh
3252540 then all of a sudden you get into an eight nine play drive and you see him not getting off the ball thats going to be the key to his career not just the key right now
3252541 i think hes a pretty well conditioned guy but all of a sudden a drive gets long you lose a little confidence you may have gotten beat a couple of times hes just got to work through that hes playing against great players
3252542 you must believe in the coach and believe in your self
3252543 as a d lineman the less you think the better you probably are watching some of the great ones play the main thing they are focused on is getting off the ball my main thing is that i do those things and when its my time to go out there do not be a hindrance to the defense be an asset
3252544 i pretty much equate it to the big league playoffs
3252545 the tournament format is different from what we are used to
3252546 we play day in day out for a long season in the united states
3252547 there are similarities between shooting in the wild and at competitions
3252548 dove hunting definitely helps here because the target presentations are similar
3252549 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3252550 earls becoming a player thats looking more and more like a starter every day
3252551 earls an up and coming player and he continues to prove that on a weekly basis
3252552 i dont have a huge ego competition is a great thing its never a bad thing im always willing to compete for my job
3252553 everybody helps each other when you do that it creates competition as a competitor you want that
3252554 theyre tough guys and they try hard all the time they have a lot of pride
3252555 were just going to let them play and see what happens
3252556 hes the hardest working player ive seen in 12 years
3252557 how do i know hes so smart ive been sitting in meetings with him for two seasons hes so smart im asking him how to do things
3252558 it always feels good when a coach or another player praises you
3252559 thats what youre in the game for to earn the respect of your peers and your coaches thats what i strive to do every day
3252560 i guess he likes what he sees theyre going to put the best guys on the field i set high standards for myself im trying to create competition and if i create competition regardless if im the starter at the beginning of the season or not the team is better
3252561 my pass rush is better than last year because i moved inside
3252562 the pass rush inside is different its not hard to do both its just different techniques
3252563 we need to get more sacks to be competitive in our division we only won one game in the afc south over jacksonville last season and better pressure could have changed some of those games because it creates turnovers and turnovers win games
3252564 jethros going to push you as far as youre willing to go
3252565 when a coach stays on you like that it brings out the best in you he doesnt let us get away with the small things its the small things that make the guys go across the water to the pro bowl and makes guys become champions
3252566 hybrid website with flash html interactive video player and custom themed wordpress blogs

3252569 my visit to port moresby canberra and wellington are also an opportunity to keep government leaders informed of progress in implementing the tasks assigned to us by all commonwealth governments collectively these include taking forward an agenda of reform of key international institutions action to tackle climate change and promoting initiatives that reduce tension and friction between different communities within societies
3252570 the pacific is a microcosm of the commonwealth it has a rich diversity of cultures and societies its economies comprise a broad spectrum of development and all the states of the region have subscribed to fundamental human values and democracy
3252571 png is an increasingly important member of tuna commission and is proactive in terms of trying to promote the development of its domestic tuna fishing industry
3252572 this is the reason why png now accounts for approximately 20 percent of the western and central pacific tuna catch so it does have a very important role to play so not only is png promoting the development of its domestic industries but also because tuna is a shared resource png is co operating with other members of the commission to promote sustainable utilization of those resources
3252573 the 2 4 million tons is 120 000 tons more than the previous record which is a very significant fishery

3252575 ive started to look at the land in a whole different way since the dig
3252576 a lot of the things that i saw in the inter tidal area before never really seemed natural but i didnt quite understand what they were
3252577 it didnt just take a month or a year it took generations to construct these traps
3252578 i can see now the intricate systems they had set up to provide for their families

3252593 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3252594 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3252595 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3252596 i was excited when i found out i was selected
3252597 ill go meet new people from all over the u s and work on my leadership skills and how to work with people
3252598 i just love to run and being outside with my friends
3252599 shes been saying she wants to be a doctor since she was 3

3252601 gt here for an overview of the forum and the participants posts
3252602 that inspired my own doctoral thesis in sociology at stanford university the articles proposition being that industry ties with universities make university research more commercial protective and proprietary and less disinterested open and collegial in the academic sense

3252604 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid
3252605 saw him walking pulled up in front of him and jumped out said go to the front of the car and it was on like donkey kong after that and i wasnt holding back
3252606 it looks like he may have had some type of medical event
3252607 we have imposed curfew to ensure the peaceful burial of sheikh aziz
3252608 we are trying to ascertain what forced security personnel to open fire
3252609 for demanding lifting of an economic blockade we get bullets
3252610 while hindu fanatics who are attacking muslims in jammu and setting their property on fire are allowed to do whatever they want
3252611 this is an accident and we expect to follow appropriate procedures under international rules
3252612 we get some dice and throw em up against the wall
3252613 its been an amazing experience a couple of months ago i dont think many people thought id be on the team
3252614 to be part of this has been an honor ive never seen anything like that 4 by 100 relay in my life it wasnt only the most exciting swimming event ive ever seen but the most exciting sporting event ive ever seen the way jason lezak finished it made me start to think that anything is possible if i put my mind to it
3252615 the most important races are the ones coming up i couldnt ask for anything else so far im very happy with how things are going but i take one race at a time
3252616 he just waited for the perfect time to make his move if we wanted to do that race again im not sure we could it was the perfect race at the perfect time
3252617 after the first 50 i dont know if i was shock or what
3252618 it wasnt really what i had thought about thats just shows you never can say anything is impossible to be a body length behind with 50 to go and come back to win shows anything can happen
3252619 i had to force myself to put that race out of my head its not easy

3252622 a cold blooded multiple murder carried out in a savage manner
3252623 you failed to kill ian jennings who escaped into the back garden but you shot the other men present and attempted with your brother to kill the two women with a knife in order to eliminate witnesses
3252624 nothing can change what has happened or alleviate the impact pain and suffering that this has had on ourselves other family members and the vast numbers of friends and family to whom my dad matt and gorgeous our puppy meant so much
3252625 despite what happened in the months leading up to this tragedy nobody deserved what happened on the night of the 28th
3252626 and its for those reasons we are grateful to both the court and the jury for finding the two men who committed this atrocity guilty
3252627 as a family we are devastated and horrified by the way tony was killed tony was only 33 when he died and him not being around has left a huge void in the family home tony was a loving father who spent nearly every weekend with his son his little boy misses him very much
3252628 he was a generous man and a larger than life character who was greatly respected by his family and large network of friends we know nothing will bring tony back but we are pleased that the people who did this to him have been brought to justice
3252629 in my career i had never ever experienced any crime like this when three people had been killed and in cold blood and with nothing to actually build upon on why it had taken place
3252630 it was completely disproportionate to a drug deal that had gone wrong
3252631 i cannot believe that anybody can carry out what he carried out and not have any feelings of remorse
3252632 seeing a murder on television can help work off ones antagonisms and if you havent any antagonisms the commercials will give you some
3252633 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3252634 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3252635 i was scared but this is what i have been training for this is where preparation meets opportunity
3252636 seeing a murder on television can help work off ones antagonisms and if you havent any antagonisms the commercials will give you some
3252637 it is how did you come to know of our organisation a few of us just recently started this what do you want

3252640 leave that to us but it could cost you a lot first we have to get the opposing mps to vote for your side then we have to tail your mps finally theres our fees too
3252641 why tail our mps they are ok they are with us
3252642 oh are they you dont understand the back side of democracy we may have to use resort politics to keep your mps like a flock of sheep and shepherd them to a resort so that musharraf and his men cant poach them we move them from resort to resort and bring them directly to the house on the day of voting sometimes you may to have to change the bus midstream so that nobody has a clue where you are taking them next their mobiles will have to be confiscated temporarily you will learn all this by and by
3252643 you guys are so good in these things whats your fee
3252644 you will make sure the motion for impeachment will be passed
3252645 we never quote without making sure of the result 50 payment before the job balance after the job

3252651 dont worry about that will send cds and also arrange a separate bhaitak of mian ghulam ali at your house our job should be done

3252655 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3252656 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex

3252658 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3252659 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice

3252661 it goes without saying that our simulation models can also be applied to all kinds of materials and used in other sectors of industry
3252662 we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3252663 our voters and edwardss voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3252664 my instinct tells me that she probably would have done better had senator edwards not been on the ballot in iowa but that wasnt the circumstances at the time
3252665 it is in no mood to pick a public fight with the clinton camp
3252666 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3252667 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3252668 there are elements within the us administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and the isi
3252669 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviours from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3252670 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3252671 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3252672 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3252673 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3252674 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3252675 she eva asked victoria to come on board and help
3252676 victoria was thrilled and talked it through with her husband david but he thought she was spreading herself a bit thin and should concentrate on what she was good at running a successful fashion line and looking after the family

3252685 both upstream and downstream businesses reported strong growth in operating profits while the petrochemical segment suffered from extremely weak integrated petrochemical margins
3252686 all time high diesel and kerosene crack spreads and the positive effect of inventory holding also supported our operating performance
3252687 i take the train because its a lot cheaper and easier if i drive it will cost me around one hundred to one hundred fifty dollars in gas and the train is forty dollars each way
3252688 being on the roads and worrying about mileage and your car and gas all those things add up
3252689 because gas prices are up and they like it and its cheaper for them to take the train than the car
3252690 i think that americans need to seek alternative sources as far as transportation and fuel and i think a train is going to be a great alternative

3252693 almost immediately after his return from the olympics in china bush warned russia in his strongest comments since the fighting erupted over georgias separatist
3252694 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3252695 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3252696 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3252697 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3252698 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3252699 by the way i dont have a particular stance on the issue obviously id prefer to see this kind of stuff restricted to some extent but im a realistic person and i know that will never happen which is why i could care less if they close them or open them because i also know that ramadan will be full of alcohol consumption as arabs not tourists scour the city in search of a drop to drink the reality is that most people who drink in jordan are in fact jordanians and would by any other definition be considered drunks if not borderline alcoholics the casual drink is non existent liquor cabinets are probably being filled as for ramadan well what can i say nothing is sacred anymore that doesnt surprise me
3252700 as i strolled through the medina town on saturday in search of drugs the prescription kind and yogurt the greek kind walking side by side through the crowded streets were politics and nipples i do not find this sexy perhaps the chaps do that being said it is not appropriate for a saturday walk in the rabat medina two weeks before ramadan get a grip look at a map think where you are i am neither moroccan nor muslim and it offended me
3252701 the nice woman at the apothecary tells me it is two weeks to ramadan
3252702 ramadan is next week it is something special for us as muslims and even for christians who are living with us in syria and the middle east you can say that it is a celebration and waiting for biggest one at the end of its 30 days it is not an only fasting from the sunset to the sunrise it is another way of life totally different from what we used to live during a year
3252703 when we were growing up having eid start over a few days depending on which turban you followed was great

3252709 im pleased that procurve is trying to add additional components to the product side
3252710 when youre talking wireless its definitely in every conversation were having today
3252711 being a procurve partner and presenting a procurve solution and you dont have 11n youre dead in the water
3252712 its a technology space we felt we needed to own
3252713 we will be creating demand for them and giving them a broader set of solutions
3252714 this will definitely be a great move and a great way for us to have a strong wireless offering without just key components
3252715 this is a great segue to get into new markets with them
3252716 i think procurve was heading in this direction already and this helps them leapfrog to where they were going
3252717 this acquisition is going to speed this up for procurve and for me
3252718 i expect procurve will take this product line and add in the wire line security components that other wireless vendors are missing
3252719 we will look at the opportunities out there in the market and understand how it impacts our customers
3252720 what this does is strengthen the portfolio strategy we already had were not moving away from our network edge strategy
3252721 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3252722 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3252723 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3252724 a little over a month ago following my appearance on
3252725 voglio continuare a regalare gol e allegria al mio paese

3252728 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3252729 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3252730 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3252731 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3252732 the first published study on babies born from vitrification shows no adverse effects of the technique and there are no implications to evies health as a result of the vitrification process
3252733 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3252734 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3252735 look i made a difference i blogged about conflated assholery in society
3252736 the tabloids were going so far as to alter photos i could never figure out why they went to all that trouble to make me look fat
3252737 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on but theyre all over me its like there is a campaign to demean me
3252738 you know what i think when i see those fat photos i am not going to let them control me i just let it all hang out you want to look at me go ahead and look

3252740 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3252741 the hole created by generic forms of lipitor will be so gapingly big that its hard to argue convincingly for an acquisition
3252742 so wall street would be super skeptical about the success of bringing two problem children together
3252743 business development continues to be a focus and is part of all of our revenue growth strategies
3252744 we continue to be selective and diligent on the assets we pursue which is essential to any successful business development effort
3252745 these strategic deals add depth to our pipeline and the potential for new innovative medicines
3252746 pfizer can fine tune their focus and make focused acquisitions but it would be hard to imagine a massive transformational deal
3252747 pfizer hasnt done anything wrong its not like they missed this great aha moment
3252748 its just a long slow process changing a company of this size in this market
3252749 given their size they can make any number of small acquisitions but that still wont make a meaningful difference to their bottom line and research and development pipeline
3252750 theres not one magic answer for them its not like they missed doing that one step that would have made all the difference they are so big and so complicated that theres no easy solution
3252751 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you

3252753 they fight they cheer they strip and theyre headed for brown
3252754 there are elements within the us administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and the isi
3252755 if anything it undermines the innovations when financial market players are operating in a totally wild west environment
3252756 weve seen again and again when you lose public trust its extremely difficult to re establish it

3252832 whoa boy i dont think we know each other that well yet
3252833 bei uns in k ln sind spieler aus aller welt willkommen
3252834 so untypisch ist das doch gar nicht das gabs immer wieder mal in cottbus zum beispiel oder wie viele engl nder spielen denn noch bei arsenal oder chelsea ich kann mich erinnern als ich vor ein paar jahren in der winterpause nach gladbach gewechselt bin war ich der erste deutsche torsch tze
3252835 nein fast jeder versteht deutsch ansonsten englisch und die fl che verstehe ich schon in allen sprachen
3252836 w rde ich so nicht sagen wenn die deutschen spieler gut genug w ren best nde doch keine not die ausl nder heben das niveau der liga enorm
3252837 mir kam es als junger spieler nicht auf die kohle an aber es ist schwer f r einen jungen kerl wenn ihm ein gestandener ausl nder vorgesetzt wird
3252838 wenn man bei uns guckt ja zum beispiel kommt da ein pierre wom marvin matip hat in der r ckrunde auf der linken seite sehr gut gespielt jetzt haben wir mit wom auf dieser position einen so erfahrenen mann da ist es klar dass es f r einen jungen deutschen schwer wird
3252839 ich denke dass ist oft aus der not geboren wer sich damit br stet hat kein geld wenn geld da ist wird auch nicht nur mit jungen deutschen spielern gearbeitet
3252840 vom gro en durchbruch zu reden das mag ich nicht ich will meine 20 25 spiele machen wir haben enorm viel konkurrenz ich will einfach bestandteil der mannschaft sein
3252841 n o conseq ncia de uma amea a mas para preservar a seguran a dos jornalistas
3252842 n o conseq ncia de uma amea a concreta mas uma medida para preservar e garantir a seguran a nos jogos espero que n o tenha um efeito negativo nem suponha um inconveniente para os jornalistas
3252843 as televis es tinham recebido imagens pr vias dos ensaios como recurso para que as utilizassem se considerassem conveniente e pode ser que algumas o tenham feito j que a visibilidade naquela noite n o era muito boa em pequim
3252844 estava me sentindo bem tanto quanto nas eliminat rias o mais importante foi a classifica o para a final estar entre os melhores do mundo
3252845 essa fase j passou agora me preparar para a final desta quarta feira espero melhorar minha marca
3252846 espero que possamos ocupar o primeiro lugar do grupo e evitar encontrar os brasileiros
3252847 acho que eles tamb m querem evitar a it lia
3252848 o que eu disse e de acordo com toda a restante imprensa portuguesa foi que tinha uns assuntos pessoais pendentes com o jo o para al m do combate mas no tapete o que me move a medalha de ouro tudo o resto n o interessa
3252849 we were a mature side when i first arrived here in 2005 and 2006 we were the third oldest side in the competition and now we one of the youngest sides
3252850 and while we are in about the same position on the ladder we are now doing it with much younger blokes
3252851 legitimate richmond people who follow the club i still believe are happy to now see the right young men playing for their footy club
3252852 they just werent around to be played earlier we made 25 changes to the list in the first two years and you cant make 40 changes and we had 17 and 18 year olds then who are now 21 and 22 and it just takes time to build a successful team but i knew that when i took on the job
3252853 but if we continue to improve next year with young players then we are heading in the right direction but if we stagnate now that we have got young players playing or dont continue to improve then we are not heading in the right direction
3252854 absolutely that will be the case and after a five year period why wouldnt that be the case
3252855 i have said before that if i am not coaching richmond beyond next season then i wont be coaching because i am not at the stage in my career where i want to take up another coaching job and another starting challenge that goes for a seven or eight year period
3252856 i would love to be here when gun midfielders brett deledio gets to 25 years of age and trent cotchin has 100 games under his belt and our backmen luke mcguane will thursfield and kelvin moore have played together for six years
3252857 that is my desire to achieve that and i will be working as hard as i can
3252858 and while we are not where we want to be at the moment we believe our graph is heading in the right direction and with the right age bracket of players
3252859 er yes were in america i think its safe to say that this is indeed an american potato
3252860 i mean is it one of those what is it begins with an i
3252861 if you dont answer the next fifty questions i swear i wont be responsible for my actions

3252864 not these cats the cats we had before 5 years ago
3252865 oh yes jasper and meadow i remember they were beautiful cats too
3252866 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
3252867 today i really focused on the race and not the outcome
3252868 its exciting to being the final bring it on im going to treat this like any other go out and just have fun
3252869 it made a very big difference it spoiled our strategy and we were caught between attacking and defending
3252870 had we lost today then i think it would have difficult
3252871 lo que dice la sentencia es que se tienen que eliminar los contenidos previa identificaci n suficiente de telecinco lo que dice el auto no es una cosa diferente a la pol tica normal que tenemos lo que te dice la ley es que tiene que ser una autoridad competente quien identifique pero nosotros lo hacemos independientemente de que sea un juez quien nos lo ha dictado ofrecemos este servicio de forma gratuita y con tener las url de los videos se eliminan autom ticamente

3252878 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3252879 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3252880 let it be a un mandated international force ideally eu
3252881 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3252882 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3252883 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3252884 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3252885 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3252886 i just started converting on the big points much better
3252887 i missed a couple of shots and he came up with a good shot and the next thing you know he won the second set

3252891 teko is like any other player at pirates why should he be treated with kid gloves unlike other players there was nothing wrong with him sitting on the bench and he like any other player must work hard for his position in the team

3252925 i cant believe this japanese team is going out already
3252926 they played some brilliant technical football its really a mystery
3252927 our system was a little bit off in the first game
3252928 we tried to tighten it up but we never quite got to the point where we were able to create chances and keep teams under constant pressure
3252929 we are often compared with the brazilians and the europeans but we need to locate a kind of japanese football that works for us we like to play the ball on the ground and move it around and we need to focus more on scoring goals
3252930 for us the collective approach is the most important thing
3252931 but we need to find a way to score goals more consistently
3252932 even though our olympic journey is over we will go out in our last match and try to play the football we know how to play and try to get a result and a few goals too

3253042 what remains is an absolute determination not to be defeated by georgia and not to suffer the humiliation of having to abandon russias south ossetia client state with everything that this would mean for russian prestige in other areas vladimir putins kremlin made it clear again and again that if georgia attacked south ossetia russia would fight georgian advocates in the west claimed that moscow was only bluffing it wasnt
3253043 russias attacks over the weekend leave the west looking for ways it can exert its power to deter any further aggression the west is under no obligation to help georgia because it is not a member of nato
3253044 they were unrealistic to think the united states and europe would come to their military aid
3253045 as the worlds diplomats hurried to contain the violence and prevent the conflict engulfing the wider caucasus region russia made clear it no longer considered georgias president mikhail saakashvili a partner prompting accusations from his main ally the united states that moscow was resisting peace and wanted regime change
3253046 there are three basic facts to keep in mind about the smokin little war in ossetia 1 the georgians started it 2 they lost 3 what a beautiful little war
3253047 there is some truth in this analysis but only some in the first place russia may have behaved with shocking brutality but this was in response to georgian troops going into south ossetia there was provocation this tiny disputed parcel of land is admittedly legally part of georgia but it has been independent for 15 years and its population of 70 000 includes russian passport holders and many sympathetic to russia
3253048 first diplomacy president mikhail saakashvili of georgia is a headstrong fellow reference has been made to his harvard education as if that should ensure sound judgment alas however the presidents tutor was not the greatest of harvard diplomatists henry kissinger but anthony eden at suez mr saakashvili has only one defence against the charge of criminal irresponsibility a plea of insanity
3253049 no doubt saakashvilis government has been rash by daring the russians in their own backyard neither does georgia have the wherewithal to take on vastly superior russian forces nor is the west likely to come to its aid
3253050 i stand for being totally open about the existing problems
3253051 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3253052 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3253053 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3253054 we have not received a clear answer today to that question
3253055 why start a second front from abkhazia why attack the rest of georgia and why attack the infrastructure of georgia why threaten to attack the civilian airport of tbilisi
3253056 expressing its deep concern with the situation the conflict zone
3253057 unfortunately the information we get from the battle arena proves that the russian federation which played a mediatory role for a long time in the conflict settlement is turning into its party
3253058 discuss with the georgian authorities concrete measures to stop the military confrontation
3253059 the state of ukraine which has been supplying weaponry to georgia so that it got armed to the teeth and with that directly encouraging the georgian authorities to start the intervention and ethnic cleansing in south ossetia has no moral right to tutor others and seek to participate in the settlement
3253060 we know that kiev sold several amd systems to tbilisi among those there could be the s 200 systems
3253061 has the right in accordance with the international law and the law of ukraine to forbid the ships and vessels that may take part in a conflict to return to the territory of ukraine till the conflict is resolved

3253063 you should take it seriously ukraine makes no secret it can easily side with your opponent
3253064 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3253065 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tblisi

3253069 can you imagine if russia shoots down the us planes bringing the georgian troops from iraq
3253070 russia has gone out of south ossetia and out of abkhazia deep into georgian territory a small beautiful democracy
3253071 yes of course there are faults on both sides historically it is a complicated dispute but what is happening now is unacceptable
3253072 russia has to be aware there will be very strong international diplomatic coordinated responses
3253073 is it feasible for us to discuss a new strategic partnership with a russia that is behaving in such a brutal way against one of its democratic neighbours
3253074 there is no military solution to whats happening russia will score a military victory over georgia by sheer weight of power of numbers of determination of planning but you cannot force a military solution
3253075 this will have to be resolved diplomatically and that means an end to the violence by all sides a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks

3253125 if school authorities are concerned that the student body compositions of certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an equal educational opportunity to all of the students they are free to devise race conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in a different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic individual typing by race

3253412 i have some symptoms of a concussion but not really too bad it could be a whole lot worse im thankful its as good as it is
3253413 hopefully he gets cleared at the end of the week and that numbness goes away
3253414 you always want to get up and walk off and i asked them to let me to but they wanted to take extra precautions and take me off on the stretcher and get everything checked out
3253415 i dont know if i have bad luck or something but every time i have a chance to go in when the guy in front of me goes down something happens to me but thats just part of the game
3253416 anytime you miss two weeks of camp thats development and timing and right now mines a little off
3253417 i dont want to push it too much in the preseason and set myself back so im going to be careful with it but i want to be out there
3253418 maybe a few weeks but its really hard to say
3253419 the first week is probably the most important week trying to get off these crutches im really working hard to do that because i hate them
3253420 the openers the most important right now and i have to work hard to be back at least by then
3253421 im going to go out and give my all and see what happens i have to make sure theres no drop off at all
3253422 before the game i was kind of shell shocked but d j williams saw me and told me it was the same thing as college and just go out there do what i do and have fun
3253423 i had an opportunity to make plays and turn heads and thats what i went out there to do
3253424 i had a lot of knocks coming out of college but one thing im a competitor i love to compete i love the game of football
3253425 all i can do is control every rep i get in practice and in games hopefully i do well on those reps and my past experience will stand for itself and i can earn a job
3253426 i think i was in a bit of a hurry at the start but later i settled down
3253427 i know it is a bit embarrassing that i have got only a bronze but at least i have finally won an olympic medal before ending my career
3253428 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3253429 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3253430 i was excited when i found out i was selected
3253431 ill go meet new people from all over the u s and work on my leadership skills and how to work with people
3253432 i just love to run and being outside with my friends
3253433 shes been saying she wants to be a doctor since she was 3
3253434 but really would just love to go and see for myself
3253435 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3253436 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3253437 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3253438 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3253439 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3253440 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3253441 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3253442 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3253443 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3253444 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3253445 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names
3253446 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty incredible accomplishment
3253447 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3253448 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3253449 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3253450 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3253451 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3253452 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3253453 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3253454 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3253455 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3253456 gt here for an overview of the forum and the participants posts
3253457 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid
3253458 saw him walking pulled up in front of him and jumped out said go to the front of the car and it was on like donkey kong after that and i wasnt holding back
3253459 it was a grind out there you really had to keep it below the wind
3253460 the wind definitely died down when we hit the back nine which helped
3253461 the winds didnt bother me too much today i was able to get on the right side of the hole which help me score well

3253476 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3253477 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3253478 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3253479 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3253480 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3253481 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3253482 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3253483 los bienes materiales de por s son buenos no sobrevivir amos sin dinero ropa y casas pero si nos negamos a compartir lo que tenemos con los hambrientos y los pobres transformamos esos bienes en una falsa deidad cu ntas voces en nuestra sociedad materialista nos dicen que la felicidad consiste en acaparar el mayor n mero posible de bienes y objetos de lujo pero as los bienes se transforman en deidades falsas en vez de dar la vida son portadores de muerte
3253484 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3253519 the scale of cynicism is surprising and the skill to present white as black and black as white the trick to present the aggressor as the victim of an aggression and to place the responsibly for the effects on the victims
3253520 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3253521 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3253522 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3253523 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3253524 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3253525 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3253526 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
3253527 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
3253528 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
3253529 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
3253530 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
3253531 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
3253532 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
3253533 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
3253534 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches

3253551 its one of those things that you know when catch the ball by the sideline you get your feet down right away its the first thing you think about
3253552 he always has a little insight to help us with
3253553 even when hes doing drills i just watch how he goes about things hes been playing in the league for a long time hes great at his position so i try to be a student and learn what hes doing
3253554 as he came through the ranks he was marked that way as a special teams contributor but hes got a chance to be a guy that can contribute on offense too
3253555 their pitching staff their bullpen is real good when you have a pitching staff like they have you always have a chance

3253572 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3253573 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3253574 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3253575 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3253576 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3253577 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3253578 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3253579 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3253580 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3253581 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3253582 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3253583 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3253584 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3253585 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3253586 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3253587 dissociate themselves from any mobile based money transfer service which has not received explicit approval of rbi or not covered by any of the guidelines issued
3253588 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3253589 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses

3253636 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at the department of homeland security they are in charge i think it is election season and they have decided it did not work for us one way with comprehensive reform so lets try to exploit it politically another way through harsh enforcement
3253637 aside from being demeaning to the law enforcement officers that uphold the very laws passed by mr gutierrezs congress its potentially dangerous no member of congress should be encouraging the public to defy or demean federal law enforcement officers words matter
3253638 what happens is the public image of you becomes one of not this compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a gestapo type agency that is knocking on doors

3253642 two men called at the door and assaulted the male occupant when he opened it
3253643 they entered the property and threatened the other occupants before taking items including cash and mobile phones
3253644 one of the men had a bandana across his face and the second offender was wearing a black hooded top with the hood up the offenders left in a black bmw
3253645 things are very bad for pensioners at the moment in all spheres the pension is inadequate to cover the increasing fuel costs
3253646 we are the forgotten ones unless the government increases the heating allowance there will be more people dying from hypothermia and this will particularly affect the single woman pensioners who are struggling to keep a house going
3253647 many pensioners are already struggling to cope with household bills which have risen very rapidly over the last year most pensioners are on a fixed income and thus have no alternative but to try and economise just to pay their essential bills
3253648 we know that older people often consider turning their heating off because they are worried about rising bills
3253649 but instead we would urge them to think about energy saving initiatives such as loft and cavity wall insulation i imagine that many householders in suffolk will be dreading the arrival of bills on the doormat this coming winter
3253650 thats the sort of level last seen in the early 1990s
3253651 high prices seem hardwired into this market for the foreseeable future
3253652 that hits the poor the hardest the most important policy issue facing the government is how to protect vulnerable consumers from these hammer blows
3253653 so far it has not taken the necessary steps to fight fuel poverty yet it needs to act now
3253654 it will take about five years before we are sure it will work but we do expect it to work and if it does it will be a very low cost solution which could be used for some other river banks
3253655 the environment agency comes up with high tech high cost solutions and we have here a low tech low cost solution at the moment where there are problems with river banks the environment agency is saying it can not repair them as it is not cost effective
3253656 i am saying we could have some oak posts and screens to arrest the tide and the saltmarsh will regenerate and protect the banks
3253657 it is sad to see two young people charged with the murder of a baby these are always difficult cases
3253658 it is clear to me that the three of you became involved in this simply as an act of gratuitous vandalism
3253659 not only did the fire cause that monetary damage but also july being the start of the summer season 33 beach hut owners had their summer ruined unable to enjoy the facilities that they had no doubt invested time and pride into
3253660 joanne was a delightful child always friendly and very willing to join in and help in school she loved all kinds of activities and especially being on our school allotment where she spent many happy hours
3253661 she had so enjoyed a picnic on the farm that we are linked with on her last day in school she was a fun loving little girl very friendly and popular she enjoyed a joke and her personality sparked a great many will miss her she was a joy to know and teach our hearts go out to the family and we know everyone will want to support and help them
3253662 the whole street is upset it is horrible it is just really upsetting because you try and do what you can at the time and then to hear that she has passed away is very sad
3253663 you just start to think that if only i had done this or that but at the end of the day there is nothing else that i could have done i just helped as much before the ambulance came
3253664 we have needed speed bumps here for years i have been here for three years and in that time it has got a lot worse at all times of the day it is dreadful the cars and buses are going to fast
3253665 i could not stop shaking when i found out and to be honest i cannot stop thinking about the little girl at the time we thought that she was going to be okay once the ambulance arrived and rushed her to hospital people are very saddened by it
3253666 we are looking to finish it off today so that the season tickets and online facility will be completely ready so that we can be sure that we are able to accept all the necessary credit card facilities for the coming week
3253667 we would rather get that all done and complete today and be in a good position to have four clear days of sales
3253668 the fact we can go online will make the process easier for people to get hold of their tickets
3253669 i hope they get things sorted out its a shame they are not on sale yet because people are champing at the bit
3253670 it is testament to the hard work of everyone in involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
3253671 in hadleigh farm we have a world class venue for the games with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
3253672 i am absolutely delighted hadleigh farm is the chosen venue for the mountain biking event of the london 2012 games
3253673 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase hadleigh and essex to the world to provide a real legacy both for local people and the international mountain bike community and show everyone all essex can offer for sport business tourism and sustainable regeneration
3253674 the only way he could play was because he was stoned but the following day he would pay the price for his over exertions
3253675 whilst his abilities appeared to be improving to a certain extent that was temporary
3253676 we saw these kids playing quite close to us and then we noticed them bobbing past
3253677 the girl looked up and we shouted to she if she was okay it was obvious that she was not because she kept going under the water and then started shouting for help
3253678 our friend ran off to find someone with a mobile phone because we did not have ours with us and i stripped off and went in to pull the girl out
3253679 i swam out to them and pulled her back to shore and he managed to get himself together and swam back
3253680 i am a reasonably strong swimmer so i had no reservation about going in but what else can you do
3253681 i know there is the coastguard but it would probably have been too late i think potentially there could have been a disaster because had we not spotted them they would have drifted out
3253682 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3253683 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3253684 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3253685 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3253686 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3253687 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3253688 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3253689 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3253690 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3253691 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3253692 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3253693 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3253694 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3253695 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3253696 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3253697 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3253698 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3253699 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3253700 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3253701 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3253702 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3253703 we all told ourselves no holding back jonathan horton said after the preliminaries in which the americans qualified sixth out of eight finalists
3253704 both american and chinese teams must have secret weapons which they leave until the last he told reporters after sundays qualifying for womens gymnastics
3253705 it was a little bit more stressful than we hoped for
3253706 i dont know if you noticed but we didnt have the same look in us
3253707 we were shocked there were tears said liukin who is second in the all around
3253708 we just said lets do this for her and we did
3253709 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3253710 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3253711 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3253712 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3253713 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names
3253714 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty incredible accomplishment
3253715 sprint recently launched sprint web a new approach to mobile browsing that works with all palm os phones on the sprint network including
3253716 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3253717 at least 640 arbitrary detentions of political dissidents have taken place so far this year
3253718 two years after certain rearrangements in the highest circles of government the situation of civil political and economic rights continues being very unfavourable
3253719 social repression is part of the daily life of the citizenry
3253720 the incessant perfecting of the structures and methods of repression its unlikely that the situation will improve at least in the short run
3253721 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3253722 barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3253723 we have plans to include voices from across america who have never had the opportunity to participate before
3253724 each night of the convention will look very different than any convention we have seen in the past
3253725 the eu views china still largely through the trade prism
3253726 we call them a strategic partner but we mostly talk to them about bras and shoes and the exchange rate of the renminbi currency
3253727 what should worry us is not the success of the developing world but its potential failure
3253728 a stalling or a crash of growth in china would be a disaster not just for china but for us too
3253729 i dont think you can boycott a quarter of humanity
3253730 the most salient feature of the zune seems to be that its not an ipod
3253731 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
3253732 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
3253733 made two trades and fixed them up finally i got this one
3253734 in life it is always so much easier to understand the game if you know the rules
3253735 it is so much easier if you know the players
3253736 on his new planet earth physiology will react to the radiation of a differently colored sun causing him to develop abilities far beyond those of mortal men
3253737 he will be faster than a speeding prius stronger than the existing superfund program and able to leap mountains of red tape in a single bound these superpowers will sustain him in his never ending battle against conservatives wealthy industrialists and other environmental supervillains
3253738 i felt so good pulling on the costume for the first time so confident and in control i really felt like an action heroine
3253739 and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking and racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way but youre older shorter of breath and one day closer to death
3253740 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short

3253747 are we mainstream or not were going to get a complex
3253748 yah kebutuhan hidup bapaklah bapak maunya apa di kehidupan bapak sekarang
3253749 dulu sebelum saya sukses seperti sekarang ini saya juga nelayan seperti bapak tp saya tidak mau seterusnya jadi nelayan krn itu saya bekerja keras siang dan malam untuk memancing ikan dan akhirnya saya mendapatkan ikan yang buaannyyyaaak sekali saya mendapatkan byk uang dari hasil penjualan ikan saya saat itu lalu saya akhirnya berpikir uang hasil penjualan tersebut bisa saya jadikan modal utk membeli perahu dan menyewakannya ke nelayan lain sehingga akan mendatangkan uang yg lebih banyak
3253750 lalu setelah itu saya mengembangkan usaha saya dari supplier ikan mentah sampe skrg ini saya punya pabrik pengolahan ikan kalengan sendiri dan saya skrg kaya raya semua kebutuhan saya terpenuhi hingga akhirnya saya bisa menikmati tidur enak
3253751 kenapa bapak tertawa semua yg saya ceritakan itu benar adanya
3253752 maaf pak bukannya saya tidak percaya saya yakin cerita bapak memang benar hanya saja bwahahahaha
3253753 kalo masalah kebutuhan hidup saya sebenarnya tidak terlalu kekurangan krn apa saya masih bisa menghidupi istri dan 2 anak saya saya masih sanggup membayar uang sekolah kedua anak saya setiap hari kita makan cukup dan satu lagi yg harus bapak tahu
3253754 kalo semua kerja keras bapak itu hanya berujung pada tidur enak tolong bapak perhatikan emangnya saya sedari tadi sedang apa saya sedang tidur enak dan saat ini bapak sedang mengganggu tidur enak saya jd saya minta tolong ganggu nelayan lain saja saya mau tidur

3253759 granted that preaching or proclaiming in the scriptures is not restricted to something done behind a wooden pulpit between 11 00 and 12 00 on sunday mornings it is nevertheless hard to avoid the strength of this emphasis on proclamation in the new testament the reason for the emphasis lies in the message itself god has taken action and the good news is announced it is proclaimed god is not negotiating he is both announcing and confronting done properly preaching is simply the re presentation of gods gospel gods good news by which men and women come to know him thus preaching mediates god himself many preachers afraid of being thought arrogant avoid talking about preaching they prefer to think of what they do as sharing in some limited contexts doubtless there is nothing wrong with sharing but something important is lost if we never speak or think of preaching and proclamation that is our job our calling it is not arrogant to re present as forcefully as we can gods gospel it is simply faithful stewardship further if we focus on the powerful proclamation of the gospel we shall be less likely to be seduced by siren calls to soften the sheer negotiability inherent in preaching
3253760 we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
3253761 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is

3253764 i wanted to try to and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3253765 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew tae hwan was going to have a good last 50 meters so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3253766 and yep i say right on fattie keep it up ill be right behind you pushing my bike up the hill too
3253767 im through to the final thats the main thing and now i can just focus on that
3253768 you know once youre in the final anything can happen
3253769 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3253770 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3253771 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3253772 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3253773 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3253774 crimes committed in the online and physical world should not be subject to different sentences increasing the penalties for online infringement will therefore make the law more coherent

3253780 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3253781 i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
3253782 an adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered an inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered
3253783 it would absolutely suck if you paid a few bucks for a book only to find that on the first page it said once upon a time they all lived happily ever after and the rest of the book was blank
3253784 if you want a happy ending that depends of course on where you stop your story
3253785 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3253786 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3253787 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3253788 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3253789 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand
3253790 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over 3 in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
3253791 the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem

3253794 make ubs more effective and agile in managing trends in the financial industry
3253795 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3253796 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3253797 create a spirit of transformation clear accountability and transparency and will allow us to optimize funding and capital usage
3253798 three people died when security forces opened fire at a protest
3253799 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3253800 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return

3253803 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3253804 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3253805 mereka yang bersifat kesederhanaan dalam semua hal tidak akan menjadi miskin
3253806 berkhairatlah mengikut kemampuan dan janganlah menjadi keluargamu hina dalam kemiskinan

3253808 insan tidak akan melihat kesalahan seseorang yang bersifat tawaduk dan lemah lembut
3253809 for the last couple of years theyve taken hundreds of millions of dollars
3253810 this is money they charged us for gas taxes its supposed to be for roads they keep taking it away
3253811 you never mentioned the way the governor has robbed the funds collected from gas tax and licensing fees to help balance the general budget
3253812 i think if they never had that 170 million transfer and wed had that 170 million over time for transportation wed still be having this conversation today
3253813 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3253814 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3253815 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3253816 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3253817 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3253818 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3253819 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3253820 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3253821 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3253822 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3253823 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3253824 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3253825 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3253826 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3253827 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3253828 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3253829 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3253830 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3253831 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3253832 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3253833 we have to design a system thats from the eyes of a patient
3253834 youre treating somebody for a slipped disk or youre treating for a runny nose its not 35 a pop
3253835 its really payment by results what happens is and some like this and some dont it creates an internal market in the health care system for competition amongst groups of physicians in regions
3253836 for us its very refreshing that we see that someone is taking action
3253837 its something that we have been promoting for quite a long time and again its nice to see that someone is picking up those ideas because patient focused funding is the way to finance hospitals that has been going in european countries for years
3253838 certainly if there are foreign doctors who are qualified to work in our canadian system that would be one way to address the shortage of medical manpower in our province
3253839 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3253840 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured

3253843 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3253860 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3253861 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3253862 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3253863 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3253864 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3253865 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3253866 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3253867 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3253868 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3253869 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3253870 unfortunately hes at the opposite end of the athletes village and our track times have been the opposite but we are certainly spending every spare minute we have together
3253871 thats pretty huge having us race at the same time

3253875 hey joe i got an awesome idea weve got a few hundred thousand extra bucks lying around right lets get some trucks i mean we could drive em around and burn some diesel and pull right up to hospitals all over the frickin country man
3253876 dude why didnt i think of that like thats so frickin coooool
3253877 its the number one reason why people over age 65 are admitted to hospitals for that reason alone its important to raise awareness of congestive heart failure and help healthcare professionals recognize and understand its symptoms
3253878 man wed sound so so i mean authoritative man and sooo since doctors have no clue how to diagnose heart failure and since they need to be using more of our drugs like zestril toprol xl and atacand like dude itll be frickin awesome to suffocate them with a pneumatic vest connected to a mac computer and make em beg for our drugs then theyd have to use em and once we let em tour the drivers front cabin theyll want to even drive the frickin truck
3253879 dude like how big a trucks that gonna take for one simulator man
3253880 like i dunno but hey man they got these cool expandable sides heres an idea that i thought would work so i had em make a prototype
3253881 oh dude youre so awesome cant wait to see those marketing numbers soar its gonna be soooo phat
3253882 dude can i ride your coattails when you become our next ceo

3253910 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3253911 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3253912 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3253913 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3253914 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3253915 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3253916 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3253917 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3253918 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3253919 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3253920 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3253921 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3253922 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3253923 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3253924 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3253925 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3253926 the two bodies have not yet been positively identified but they are believed to be the occupants of the house

3253930 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3253931 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3253932 polonium 210 is surprisingly common polonium sources with about 10 percent of a lethal dose are readily available even in a product sold on amazon com
3253933 is effective without the filing of an application with the commission or the issuance of a licensing document to a particular person

3253935 the conclusion is reached that 0 1 0 3 gbq or more absorbed to blood of an adult male is likely to be fatal within 1 month this corresponds to ingestion of 1 3 gbq or more assuming 10 absorption to blood
3253936 reduction of subacute lethal radiotoxicity of polonium 210 in rats by chelating agents
3253937 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3253938 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3253939 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3253940 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3253941 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3253942 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3253943 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3253944 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3253945 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3253946 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3253947 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3253948 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3253949 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3253950 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3253951 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3253952 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3253953 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3253954 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3253955 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3253956 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3253957 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3253958 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3253959 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3253960 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3253961 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3253962 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3253963 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3253964 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3253965 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3253966 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3253967 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3253968 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3253969 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3253970 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3253971 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3253972 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3253973 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3253974 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3253975 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3253976 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3253977 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3253978 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3253979 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3253980 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3253981 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3253982 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3253983 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3253984 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3253985 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3253986 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3253987 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3253988 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3253989 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3253990 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3253991 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3253992 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3253993 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3253994 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3253995 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3253996 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3253997 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3253998 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3253999 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3254000 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3254001 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3254002 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3254003 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3254004 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3254005 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3254006 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3254007 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3254008 cattle are driven sheep are led and our lord compares his people to sheep not to cattle the minister coach leader must experience what he would teach or he will find himself in the impossible position of trying to drive sheep and scarcely anything is is disheartening as the sight of a vexed and confused shepherd using the lash on his bewildered flock in a vain attempt to persuade them to go beyond the point to which he himself has attained we cannot take our people beyond where we ourselves have been
3254009 only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go
3254010 are you fn kidding me i cant dead lift 225lbs and whats a thruster that sounds sexual and violent
3254011 i think i can finish this its going to take a while though
3254012 no lets go against a wall put your feet up for balance
3254013 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3254014 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3254015 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3254016 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3254017 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3254018 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3254019 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3254020 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3254021 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3254022 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3254023 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3254024 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3254025 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3254026 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3254027 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3254028 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3254029 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3254030 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3254031 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3254032 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3254033 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3254034 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3254035 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3254036 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3254037 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3254038 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3254039 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3254040 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3254041 just so you all know we did set a record
3254042 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3254043 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3254044 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3254045 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3254046 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3254047 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3254048 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3254049 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3254050 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3254051 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3254052 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3254053 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3254054 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3254055 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3254056 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3254057 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3254058 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3254059 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3254060 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3254061 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3254062 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3254063 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3254064 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3254065 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3254066 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3254067 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3254068 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3254069 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3254070 thats the only way kids will be able to learn the skills theyll need to take care of themselves when they become adults
3254071 there have always been parents who would fit the definition of helicopter parents they used to be called overprotective parents but the idea of parents who hover over their children to shield them from possible distress is as old as parenting
3254072 questioning is not bad as long as parents are willing to listen and there is true dialogue
3254073 when it results in uncompromising demands however it can become a real barrier to the childs maturity and self reliance
3254074 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3254075 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3254076 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3254077 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3254078 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3254079 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3254080 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3254081 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3254082 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3254083 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3254084 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3254085 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3254086 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3254087 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3254088 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3254089 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3254090 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3254091 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3254092 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3254093 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3254094 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3254095 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3254096 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3254097 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3254098 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3254099 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3254100 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3254101 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3254102 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3254103 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3254104 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3254105 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3254106 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3254107 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3254108 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3254109 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3254110 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3254111 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3254112 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3254113 after medvedev said the operation was finished the market turned around and went up but there is a lot of uncertainty ahead
3254114 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3254115 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3254116 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3254117 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3254118 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3254119 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3254120 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3254121 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3254122 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3254123 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3254124 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3254125 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

3254128 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3254129 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3254130 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3254131 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3254132 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3254133 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3254134 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3254135 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3254136 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3254137 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3254138 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow

3254143 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3254144 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3254149 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3254150 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3254151 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3254152 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3254153 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3254154 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3254155 the book sale is specifically important to me because im a big book reader several friends and i go to as many book sales as we can like this so it wwas really important to me that this goes on

3254164 perhaps one of the most worrying of all the losses of personal data
3254165 whilst the ministers response does not reveal any detail of the type of losses or breaches any loss or breach of a medical record whatsoever is a serious matter
3254166 patients have the right to expect that their personal medical data be subject to the most stringent of security measures sadly it would appear that this isnt always the case
3254167 it will help health planners tailor services to meet local needs
3254168 this data allows people to look at the health situation in their own county or in their own local government district
3254169 we are beginning to build a picture of health at the local level allowing people and planers to see how they compare with others in their jurisdiction and across the island
3254170 if you keep hanging around the business there will be a team you can help somewhere and im happy to be here but i was surprised that it was colorado that called
3254171 they told me in spring training that if there was an open spot that i would be called but i didnt want to wait for that i had to keep playing ball
3254172 i dont think theres much difference between this level and independent baseball
3254173 independent ball has a lot more experienced guys some of the guys have major league experience
3254174 i think independent baseball is more of a mental game the guys know the strike zone and theyve already developed the skills they pay the guys to do what they already know instead of paying them to develop skills

3254243 probably the best speech i ever gave in my life
3254244 that convention failed to do what a great national convention should do which is to show the party and show the nominee for president in the best possible light without a lot of distractions without a lot of floor battles on television at the convention without a lot of bitterness
3254245 we went down in public approval after that convention very sad
3254246 every one of them thought this was the big test winning the nomination
3254247 if you can get by these other 15 people you know president richard nixon will be a piece of cake
3254248 most people in the television audience were puzzled with what we were doing challenging these delegations
3254249 i should have had about a one month breather between californias primary the last one and the convention to carefully pick a running mate to maybe vet three or four possibilities to see whether there were any problems with any of them we never had time to do that
3254250 for half an hour the mood was light relaxed to the point of frivolity
3254251 victory was being savored for the first time in the light of day it was like a group of fraternity boys who had spent most of the night successfully stealing the rival schools mascot
3254252 i recall reading accounts of deliberations like this particularly the confusion surrounding john kennedys selection of lyndon johnson and thinking to myself if i ever get into a situation like that i am going to make sure the deliberations are careful thoughtful calm
3254253 problems of drinking and mental illness in the family perhaps a parent in a mental institution
3254254 and the time bomb destined to destroy the infant mcgovern presidential candidacy started ticking
3254255 in this case we had people getting up on the floor and nominating mickey mouse nominating various other delegates around the convention hall
3254256 in the name of freedom of speech we let that run on through the midnight hour on into the early morning before it was finally brought to a halt
3254257 i finished at 3 15 a m probably the best speech i ever gave in my life and it should have been the best i ever gave in my life
3254258 but how many people saw it at 2 30 or 3 in the morning i think my wife did maybe my mother if she didnt get too sleepy but a crowd of 90 million viewers at 9 oclock probably dwindled down to about 3 million
3254259 today 2008 people have a much better understanding of mental illness and especially depression than they did 36 years ago i didnt know much about it myself
3254260 abraham lincoln struggled with it most of his adult life at one time he said im the most miserable man another time he talked about being the saddest man on the planet and so before we made a final decision on sen eagleton if we had known about his history of illness we would have had time to talk to the doctors talk to the psychiatrist talk more to sen eagleton than we did
3254261 you know theres nothing wrong with a long campaign and this one im convinced has energized literally millions of people
3254262 that split the democratic party in two and we didnt get together at the convention or after that
3254263 the pharmaceutical industry decided there wasnt enough of a market to make male hormonal contraceptives worthwhile

3254274 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3254275 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3254276 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3254277 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3254278 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3254279 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3254280 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3254281 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3254284 they are also not as attached to e mail as their primary form of technology based communication theyre much more into text messaging and instant messaging so how you reach these voters is an important question going forward
3254285 not everyone is in front of a computer or a tv all day
3254286 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
3254287 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
3254288 we know the strategy because theyve already shown their cards ultimately i think the american people recognize that old stuff hasnt moved us forward that old stuff just divides us
3254289 what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
3254290 he isnt doing it but if its being done he isnt responsible for it and since its being done and he isnt doing it is isnt his responsibility anyway because he isnt doing it even if its being done for him and in his name
3254291 why on earth would anyone concern themselves with mccains pow status
3254292 for the first time in my life im proud to be an american
3254293 prior to this year obama has run in just one seriously contested election for congress in 2000 he lost in a landslide his victories right up until his foray into the presidential primaries have come almost effortlessly owing largely to incredible good luck and the fact that his opponents fauls were much greater than his own this makes him an unknown quantity even now as he runs for president
3254294 why does mccain think that he deserves to be president because of his service
3254295 mccains military experience was not one of a command position as gen wesley clark has so appropriately identified therefore it is irrelevant
3254296 not doing anything and treating all threats as police action
3254297 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
3254298 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3254299 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3254300 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values he told the people of nh yesterday he has a kansas accent because his mother was from there his mother lived in many states as far as we can tell but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up
3254301 we have experienced a 20 year evolution from a graphic design firm to a brand consultancy it has been a process of reinventing the traditional design firm
3254302 we have differentiated ourselves by constantly innovating and refining everything we do and challenging the conventional wisdom

3254307 i doubt the voters are going to pay much attention to a mistake made nearly 14 years ago for which apology has been made and accepted
3254308 idaho has changed a lot in 14 years with a lot of new voters arriving in that time i wonder how well those new arrivals truly know larry larocco and his past

3254312 the purpose of the employee assistance program boils down to one word productivity
3254313 there are personal problems yes but businesses dont contract with us unless they see a return on their dollars invested its preventative
3254314 the first year they had about a 10 percent utilization rate
3254315 thats really high nationwide the average is about 4 percent
3254316 eighteen percent of the given work force loses 25 percent of its productivity due to personal problems
3254317 if you run those numbers its astronomical it more than pays for itself to save one person

3254319 if youre diving and you want to see fish you have to go to the tropics
3254320 but if you want to see the best preserved shipwrecks in the world you have to dive here because you sure wont see them in saltwater
3254321 there are shipwrecks in the great lakes that are almost entirely intact to the point that you can stick your hand into the cargo hold and come up with grain if they were shipping corn or flour
3254322 its eerie to see something that youre not supposed to see underwater and strange seeing something so out of context
3254323 but its nice because you swim in some of the ships where you have big openings so you get to see into the compartments thats pretty unique
3254324 i have newly certified people go out and do a dive and they dont think theyre going to see anything
3254325 but they see the wreck they see the artifact they get back on the boat and you cant stop them from talking for the next half an hour because it is the most thrilling experience and its awesome
3254326 shipwreck divers like the drama the history the exploration of a different world
3254327 they look at the ships wheel and they imagine the helmsman struggling hard to save the ship in a storm before it sank

3254337 the concern is what is coming down the road there is a growing concern that outside capital has been tapped out to an extent
3254338 many of the capital injections that have been made into large banking companies over the last year are at this point under water meaning the stock has continued to decline in price
3254339 private equity firms get paid to be contrarians and invest where others wont tread
3254340 i think this crisis will be calling into question the entire structure of our financial framework
3254341 we cant possibly have our fund classified as a bank holding company
3254342 i personally feel the bank holding company act is outdated
3254343 the act was designed and legislated before private equity existed
3254344 its not something thats even been talked about up there i just have not heard it reach that level
3254345 i believe what the fed is trying to do is to offer more existing flexibility within the context of the existing law
3254346 unfortunately these things take three to four years and the need for capital is now
3254347 there is a need for capital in our banks and there is capital availability in our private equity funds the hurdles in terms of core competencies and the hurdles in the bank holding company act make it hard for those things to come together
3254348 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid

3254369 statically typed languages are constantly asking about your parent or grandparent or perhaps in the case of java style interfaces your aunts and uncles
3254370 i dont care who you are related to mac all i want to know is what you can do
3254371 no matter how many women start out in physics a common trend across countries is their attrition in going from undergraduate and graduate studies to permanent positions
3254372 for all sciences the fraction of scientists who are women decreases as you go up in the hierarchy so if you start in high school taking science and then go on to college taking science and then go onto graduate school and then professors and so on at every level the fraction of women in any one field is decreasing its slightly different for different fields for example in physics the big drop is really in college in high school the classes are almost fifty fifty girls to boys but when you get to college only about 20 percent of the physics majors are women this is true for other fields of science but its especially bad in physics
3254373 they seem to be really turning people off of physics in college
3254374 women want to help people so they go into the medical sciences
3254375 whats really interesting is that sociologists and psychologists have actually done a lot of research in these areas and what they find is contrary to what many scientists think
3254376 the reason there are no women in physics is because the hardest parts to go through graduate school or to become a young faculty member happen during the years when you should be having a family and women dont think they can do both so they dont go into physics
3254377 in the science profession being objective is one of the most important qualities you can have
3254378 most of us really dont want to admit were not objective
3254379 but many scientists are reluctant to admit that because its unscientific
3254380 if we can admit that were biased then we try very hard to compensate for that bias and we try to be objective and to use objective criteria but if were quite convinced that we arent biased then we think we dont need to articulate why because were sure were unbiased and therefore it must be right
3254381 the thing about a hypothesis is that you can test it against the data
3254382 i had a new graduate student come in to talk to me after only a few weeks into the year
3254383 i told her that a lot of people could do what she did last summer but its not easy for most people to become a physicist
3254384 it turns out that these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3254385 somehow we have created this myth that doing science and physics in american universities is an elite ivory tower profession where youre pondering questions that dont have any practical applications in the real world and its all about just solving problems and being clever
3254386 as for the myth of the math gap in high school girls take as much math and physics as boys and they do just as well
3254387 what ive observed in my 25 years in the field is that there are lots of young women who are really excited about physics who just love it
3254388 but if you start talking to senior graduate students you find a very different picture
3254389 when you talk to the people who actually know them it turns out that in fact these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3254390 my personal interpretation of what happens is that we go out of our way to discourage people from pursuing physics
3254391 professors will tell you that you have to go do something else that youre not good enough the correct response is
3254392 oh you think im not good enough i guess im not let me think about what else im going to do with my life
3254393 my hypothesis which is colored by my own perception is that the more elitist the field the fewer the women
3254394 were fooling ourselves thinking were getting the cream of the crop what were really doing is chasing away really bright people
3254395 women need to better understand the mechanisms of hiring funding and promotions that is how to play the game
3254396 i think first of all they have to recognize that thats the case that there is a lot of information that they are not naturally going to get and they have to go out and seek it and for many young men maybe that isnt necessary maybe they dont have to seek it out
3254397 i think its easiest to talk to somebody to relate to like you
3254398 so the advice i give young women is find yourself a bunch of mentors first of all people at your level peers who are postdocs or faculty or whatever you are
3254399 and also go to these older guys and more or less force them to mentor you
3254400 if you are an outsider the way science runs in the us at least you really cant succeed
3254401 there are also organizations within institutions within companies within professions that make this easier
3254402 for women doubting themselves we all have self doubt and theres always another hurdle maybe its getting tenure but then you want to get elected to fellowship in your professional society
3254403 men may have many of the same self doubts and concerns about their future they just dont dare think about it for most men you dont have that option to not work it wouldnt be acceptable or its really scary or whatever
3254404 women are just constantly wondering am i good enough should i be doing this maybe i should be doing something else
3254405 in terms of having a family and getting married if you have the kind of relationship where one of you is more important than the other one then no i dont think you can have a career and a family
3254406 i have been asked so many times by women can i do physics and have a family i have never once been asked that by a young man ever its just not a question for men
3254407 women in widowhood were to remained unmarried for the rest of their lives after the death of dildos
3254408 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3254409 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return
3254410 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
3254411 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
3254412 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks dollars
3254413 youre barbaric criminals how often do you hear of whites killing shooting stabbing abducting and robbing
3254414 i became enviable of australia because i think youre one of the nations that truly can come up with an energy independence strategy and you can find a way to reduce the automobiles dependence on petroleum
3254415 id really go after solar energy as a longer term bet
3254416 i think its going to be economically viable i was intrigued by how much sunshine you have and solar energy continues to look promising longer term
3254417 if i had a magic wand i would first of all set a goal to get off petroleum imported petroleum in australias case i would take advantage of biomass ethanol produced from waste and i would make a strong r amp d investment in solar energy and then i would anticipate that fuel cell vehicles and plug in electrics are going to be a very real solution
3254418 im not saying one energy source is better than the other
3254419 if this issue really is as serious as it appears to be and i think its serious we can solve it
3254420 but we cant solve it by being paralysed by all these parochial different views youve got all these people digging their heels in thinking theres a single answer and thats the only thing you have to invest in in fact you have to invest in all of them
3254421 weve developed an industry that finds itself 96 per cent dependent on petroleum and i dont think thats a robust business strategy and when you look at it you have to question how that happened
3254422 weve finally found the bottom of this topsy turvy market and its gonna be clear sailing from here time to jump back in and pad your portfolio with some nice blue chips

3254469 usually turned out to be a motor or something that was smoking something a lot smaller than this
3254470 the biggest damage of course is limited to the front desk area the registration area
3254471 they have removed all the computers to try and see if they can salvage any of those

3254477 i know this is hard to believe like the leaderboard which he doesnt look at and he actually never reads newspapers
3254478 if something comes on the television about him hell turn down the sound
3254479 hell look at the pictures in the paper he never has read articles about himself in the last 10 years because he feels that theres no point
3254480 absurd as it sounds to have the four trophies on your mantelpiece as tiger woods did padraig definitely believes he can do it
3254481 he is in that place and he really does firmly believe that if he keeps working keeps the head down that anything is possible
3254482 coming so soon after his brilliant win in the british open this was a fantastic achievement by padraig
3254483 it makes him the first european golfer to win back to back majors padraig just goes from strength to strength the whole country is immensely proud of him
3254484 to win two british opens back to back is quite an achievement but to win two majors back to back is absolutely incredible

3254507 dennis prager says that republicans think that democrats are stupid democrats think republicans are evil i can work with stupid if you are good at your job and you are stupid that is one thing but i cant work with evil and liberals believe that if you are not indiscriminate like they are you are an evil discriminator
3254508 there is an expression that the only way to say that you are a conservative in this town is to have made it so big it doesnt matter or to have made it so little that you have nothing to lose
3254509 but the guy that is working and needs that next job cant admit that he loves america cant admit that he supports the president of the united states and cant let it be known that he thinks liberating the iraqi people was the right thing to do
3254510 i was in david mamets terms a brain dead liberal
3254511 basically i grew up with the belief that democrats are good and republicans are bad democrats like people republicans like money democrats like the air republicans pollute the air democrats like peace republicans like war because its good for business i mean there was no depth to what i thought it was just ingrained
3254512 when they flew those planes into those buildings there were only two possibilities either they are evil or we deserved it and when i would hear my liberal friends say they are not evil we deserved it that made no sense to me
3254513 you know i dont need 50 50 but when youve got the media sticking their head up obamas behind and you have only one group of people saying anything about it and it is saturday night live youve got to tip your hat to them
3254514 if you think it is about money you are missing the point altogether
3254515 the power went from capitalist patriots to spoiled brat movie stars
3254516 i know hawaii is a state but it has the of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place

3254530 its a real shame for lucky and disappointing for us because he makes such a huge contribution to the side consistently every week
3254531 considering the workload he has and the job hes required to do its a tribute to him that he has been able to put such a long run of appearances together
3254532 ben has made a really good start at first grade level hes worked hard off the bench and this is a great chance for him
3254533 today was a big win for us a big win

3254536 will take their liquidity from running out in the first quarter of 2009 to around 2010
3254537 in the world of global natural gas prices that is a lifetime for domestic prices to rebound relative to europe
3254538 its just a matter of us taking the time to address their concerns
3254539 weve never looked at this through any lens other than what this would do for our shareholders and for their shareholders
3254540 as a matter of practice and policy we dont discuss ongoing litigation
3254541 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3254542 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3254543 how do we drive traffic in a really slow environment
3254544 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3254545 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3254546 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3254547 its their constituents they answer to youre just not going to find a place where politicians fight the base of the economy
3254548 its not a lack of concern its sort of a reluctant acceptance of living in an oil based economy
3254549 with those two spills youve hit the extremes in terms of public concern and public interest and media interest
3254550 as we go forward that will be our lighting of choice
3254551 it absolutely provided the level of light we are looking for to make our location bright and secure
3254552 the focused lighting puts the attention where it should be on the product were selling
3254553 it maintains a constant current despite power fluctuations its much more efficient than any fluorescent light
3254554 were quite upset as well this is not how we have our protocol set up with our producers
3254555 has taken the position previously that if intact beef that is intended for ground beef tests positive for e coli 0157 that beef is subject to recall
3254556 we applaud the senate for acting to get toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates out of our childrens toys
3254557 phthalates have been reviewed by a number of consumer safety groups
3254558 not one of them has really come to a conclusion that any of these phthalates pose risks to humans
3254559 the impact on u s plastics producers should be small particularly since most of these toy products are made outside the u s
3254560 it is becoming much more clear to the international community that it will be difficult to communicate and negotiate with the military junta which is committing genocide in burma
3254561 we believe that no exceptions can be made to justice whatever has been happening will have to be accounted for
3254562 i know the indian people sympathise with us but we also want you to write to your government to take note of our plight india should support us in the name of democracy and freedom
3254563 i urge everyone to punish those who grossly violate human rights
3254564 we are neighbours we share so many things our religion the repression the torture and even the refugee experience it is a state sponsored terrorism being carried out to destroy our culture our very being
3254565 using a heretical organization to undermine implementation of the law
3254566 xu is a prisoner of conscience detained only because of her identity as a believer of a peaceful spiritual practice and is now facing jail because the authorities fear her speaking out over her husbands death
3254567 rather than investigating yus untimely death at the hands of the police the chinese court system is preparing to send an innocent woman to prison again her case is symptomatic of the lack of rule of law in china and of the broader crackdown on falun gong ahead of the olympic games
3254568 xu na is in serious danger of being sentenced for a long time
3254569 since xu was sentenced to five years the first time the second time might be more than ten years
3254570 life in jail is horrible especially for falun gong practitioners because they will use any method to force you to give up your beliefs its awful for such a young and talented lady
3254571 using a heretical organization to undermine implementation of the law
3254572 the mount isa mining district is one of the top five mineralised districts on planet earth
3254573 it doesnt have to apologise to anyone theres the witwatersrand in south africa theres norilsk in russia theres the cadillac district fault in canada theres the main structure in chile this is one of the great mining regions in the world
3254574 our view and we talk to rio asx rio about this a lot is around the year 2012 or 2013 we are going to have a crisis in copper because a lot of the great copper mines are like little old ladies lying in bed waiting to die

3254582 industry margins can be sustained at more normalized levels of profitability
3254583 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3254584 over 3 billion page views 15 million unique users and over 60 million video streams
3254585 is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from
3254586 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3254587 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3254588 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3254589 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the politicalindependence they often act out
3254590 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3254591 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3254592 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could

3254607 i am so excited about this to be honest personally i never thought of myself as sexy or hot but if thats the call that people have taken then i hope i live up to it
3254608 we had spent a few months researching on who the winner of the first ever maxim hot 100 would be since weve been market leaders and the first ones to enter the mens lifestyle scene with a presence of almost 3 years we obviously had a close connection with our readers and the industry deepika was our choice as the winner because apart from her huge fan following with the new generation of indians she also has the potential to be an international face this calls for a huge party
3254609 cleaning the house while the children are still growing is like shoveling the walk before it stops snowing

3254612 we are trying to ascertain what forced security personnel to open fire
3254613 friends are friends forever if the lords the lord of them sing it
3254614 we can weather the economic down turn by saving our liquid capital down sizing and then bursting out when things turnaround for the better
3254615 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
3254616 im excited about the future possibilities in our sports betting industry
3254617 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
3254618 i trust the word of lenita bogg especially in these times
3254619 and will look to other analysts of the same ilk to gauge how we move forward in this environment
3254620 i saw this coming luckily i know my job is safe and if worse comes to worse ill retire early and live off a modest pension organized labor is not concerned either since many sports betting syndicates hashed out reasonable deals with corporate leadership last year
3254621 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the sports betting consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions

3254663 there are a lot of lessons students learn in school but losing their personal identity and data should not be among the lessons young people have to deal with
3254664 for students losing a term paper or project can be far more costly than taking the time to back up their data
3254665 downloading music sharing files and photos instant messaging clicking on free downloads and playing online games after doing homework of course are the top online activities for students unfortunately they are also the things that put them the most at risk
3254666 to protect their systems and their data students need to have a comprehensive online security strategy thats easy and automatic

3254674 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3254675 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex
3254676 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviours from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour

3254699 greenlaces is essentially a movement of people who are fans of the planet and care about the planet
3254700 especially we do it through athletes because we feel like athletes are icons and have stronger influences on the community than a normal individual
3254701 i have worked to promote the movement among my teammates by talking to them and telling them about greenlaces
3254702 as rowers we do almost all of our training outdoors and the environment is something we see and interact with every day when the air is bad we notice it when there is a ton of trash and debris in the lake it is something that affects us

3254756 but the opportunity to come in and be competitive both on the mens and womens side in the league right away as well as still being close to family and friends and to be at an institution like penn that does everything it does academically as well as athletically made it a choice that i couldnt pass up

3254761 when they turn 12 and 13 it becomes not as cool to like math and science
3254762 the image that people have of engineering is that its a solitary activity thats not fun that you do in a cubicle all alone and it scares girls off

3254835 the crime scene was very unpleasant one of the worst i have seen during a long career sadly
3254836 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack
3254837 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education

3254869 having the cameras by themselves will keep the honest honest it still doesnt keep the criminal element from breaking in but if it captures the license plate then we certainly will know who was in the neighborhood who doesnt belong
3254870 i conclude that it would not be an invasion of privacy to place and use a video surveillance system in that location
3254871 warning a video surveillance system has been installed for the purpose of security for the premises
3254872 residents need to be reminded that it is up to them to take whatever measures they deem necessary to provide adequate security to themselves their families and their property

3254882 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life i know live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness comes through the law then christ died in vain
3254883 but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is christ therefore a minister of sin god forbid
3254884 and those who are christs have crucified the flesh with its passions amp desires
3254885 knowing this that our old man crucified with him that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves of sin
3254886 likewise you also reckon yourselves dead indeed to sin but alive to god in christ
3254887 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works
3254888 that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he worked in christ when he raised him from the dead amp seated him at the right hand in heavenly places
3254889 put off the concerning your former conduct the old man which grows corrupt according to deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man which was created according to god in righteousness amp true holiness
3254890 are you also still without understanding do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach amp is eliminated but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile a man
3254891 i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people
3254892 if any man be in christ he is a new creation
3254893 since you have purified your hearts by obedience to the truth
3254894 since christ suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves also with the same mind for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men but for the will of god
3254895 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
3254896 but as he who called you is holy you also be holy in all your conduct because it is written be holy for i am holy and if you call on the father who without partiality judges according to each ones work conduct yourselves throughout your sojourning here in fear
3254897 beloved i beg you as sojourners and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against your soul conduct yourselves with honor among the nations
3254898 do all things without murmuring and disputing that you may become blameless amp harmless children of god without fault in the midst of a crooked amp perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world
3254899 for this is the will of god that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
3254900 but sanctify the lord god in your heart amp always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you with meekness amp fear having a good conscience that when they defame you as evildoers those who revile your good conduct in christ may be ashamed
3254901 we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard lest we drift away how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation
3254902 hearing you will hear amp shall not understand and seeing you will see amp not perceive for the heart of this people has grown dull their ears are hard of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears lest they should understand with their heart and turn so that i should heal them
3254903 these things i have written to you who believe in the name of the son of god that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may continue to believe

3254911 a verse from the veda says what you see you become in other words just the experience of perceiving the world makes you what you are this is a quite literal statement

3254935 because kurdistans success could be cataclysmic like no event since the 1948 creation of israel a declared kurdish state within the borders of iraq will unite the entire region in opposition from the black sea to the persian gulf

3254952 we have the requisite 18 tmc for the city but it would not be proper to raise the drinking water supply to 100 per cent if irrigation gets nothing
3254953 we may continue with the water cut for the entire year as we are still short of water for irrigation also it will instill discipline among people discouraging them against wasting water
3254954 the irrigation canals are carrying water to full capacity however we have to keep in ind the requirement for the rabi months and then the next summer

3254958 in 250cc i was on the podium and last year we won so with the bike performing as it has been lately we should be able to fight for a good result again
3254959 weve still got quite a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy but the whole team are working so hard and well give it our best shot
3254960 after the race at laguna seca in the us i went back to australia and spent a bit of time with my wife and family away from the track
3254961 i got some rest in but i also trained hard and now i cant wait to get back on the bike
3254962 weve said as a group that we believe that thats making the eight now out of our control it really comes down to others winning and losing having an impact on where were going
3254963 were not even looking at the eight we saw the win last weekend in being the situation where that controlled our opportunity to make the eight and we lost that opportunity
3254964 so now its out of hands and in the hands of others

3254980 it will be a very small effect but there will be an effect i think itll be delayed probably over two or three years whatever the final effect will be
3254981 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year
3254982 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3254983 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree
3254984 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference
3254985 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums
3254986 id have to say its nowhere near the five per cent range that a number of people have talked about
3254987 im not going to give a figure because its again i think in terms of the modelling still quite speculative but thats certainly the impact that we have done some analysis on that suggests a relatively small impact on a number of premiums

3254995 hes an important part of our squad and hes our top scorer for the last couple of years so hell be putting pressure on people that will be playing

3255016 when they quiz me about the treatment of my role i have no answers for them its all right if i had been indifferent from the beginning but i was assured that my role would be satisfactory even before the project commenced i did not expect to be treated like this from a highly respected team
3255017 pasupathy and i had three children in the film two girls and a boy in this particular scene the boy who is dark skinned like his father asks me why he is dark it was a touching scene and came out very well everyone on the sets applauded it i was surprised that it was not used in the final version that made it to the theatres

3255075 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3255076 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials

3255079 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3255080 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3255081 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3255082 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3255083 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3255084 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3255085 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3255086 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3255118 even if prostate cancer screening is determined to be effective the length of time required to experience a mortality benefit is greater than 10 years because a 75 year old man has an average life expectancy of about 10 years very few men age 75 years or older would experience a mortality benefit similarly men younger than age 75 years who have chronic medical problems and a life expectancy of fewer than 10 years are also unlikely to benefit from screening and treatment

3255121 love can be the most wonderful feeling you will ever experience it can also be the worst pain your heart will ever feel left all alone in love ones soul slowly dies keeping ones love alive

3255193 well non interference policy is something that is stated in the un charter you respect others soverignty its one of the basic rules of international relations
3255194 but lately there is a new concept called r2p right to protect that allows interfering when considered necessary for certain interests

3255196 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3255197 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3255198 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3255199 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3255200 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3255201 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3255202 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3255203 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3255204 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3255205 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3255206 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3255207 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3255208 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3255209 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3255210 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3255211 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3255212 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3255213 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3255214 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3255215 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3255216 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3255217 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3255218 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3255219 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3255220 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3255221 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3255222 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3255223 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3255224 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3255225 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3255226 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3255227 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3255228 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3255229 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3255230 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3255231 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3255232 in fact when i asked directions to the supermarket earlier this week i was told to turn left at the giant condom
3255233 not that theres anything wrong with condoms its just that i wouldnt like my drinking water to come out of one
3255234 before you bella my life was like a moonless night very dark but there were stars points of light and reason and then you shot across my sky like a meteor suddenly everything was on fire there was brilliancy there was beauty when you were gone when the meteor had fallen over the horizon everything went black nothing had changed but my eyes were blinded by the light i couldnt see the stars anymore and there was no more reason for anything
3255235 and besides couldnt you pick something more original than spoons
3255236 spoons ill have you know are quite original and they serve me well
3255237 this model the campbell soup spoon 2030 is extremely good for pinning down runaways because of its large head when the user throws it the weight at the tip of the spoon hurls it toward the target

3255303 in this way furgeson was much like fellow portland storytelling songwriter colin meloy able to stitch these ideas and their subsequent imagery seamlessly into catchy sing along pop
3255304 bark hide and horn is a portland based fock rock quartet and they bring the zoological ruckus while their adventurous acoustic and brass aesthetic is cool enough in its own right i cant help but adore the subject matter of their songs they focus on the wonders of the natural world particularly those aspects of it that were covered in national geographic magazine from 1957 1967 did everybody elses parents have a stash of those too i can just imagine them thumbing through those issues digging for material

3255460 the global rating for qantas is interesting we do find that many flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3255461 the lounge concept for both product and staff service has been modelled around the finest quality you would expect to find in a five star hotel or restaurant and the best part is that the concept is being so well delivered by qantas

3255495 i know a lot of players who smoke a lot of my friends and team mates smoked it is part of life
3255496 it just depends if he smokes five cigarettes or 20
3255497 i know my team for the andorra and croatia games but for the next one some very important players are not fit right now
3255498 we have to wait for a decision but against the czechs the first xi will be the best for me at that particular time
3255499 gerrard and rooney are very important players and i dont know whether they will be fit for this game
3255500 but i hope they will be fit for andorra and croatia and well be able to play them in the squad
3255501 c compiled versions of lua ruby perl and python all running on the web in secure flash sandboxes
3255502 i hope the community shield wont be the last trophy we win this season
3255503 weve worked hard in pre season and ive seen the hunger in the players eyes
3255504 we are ready to win more trophies because there exists a winning mentality at united
3255505 paul scholes gary neville and ryan giggs have been at the club for so many years but they are still so driven to win trophies
3255506 we saw in the community shield that they are ready to fight for every ball this pushes other players on
3255507 they set the example that the rest of us need to follow they are important players for us
3255508 we have a big squad everyone stayed over the summer and maybe the boss will look to bring in one more player
3255509 we have missed wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo during pre season but against portsmouth we saw that other players can fill their positions
3255510 chelsea are always the main rivals they have a great team with big players its easy for them to buy players
3255511 my philosophy is that weve got a lot of players who worked very hard last year and i want to keep that spirit and build and evolve with it
3255512 so i was very conscious of trying to bring players in the other players would look at and say theres no problems they are the players that will help us stay in the premier league rather that than just signing anyone
3255513 i have been a little bit more selective than hull or west brom but weve got money to spend theres money there ready to go
3255514 ive been told by other managers that it would be very difficult
3255515 if a player is in the process of moving clubs you usually find that the agent will tout them and hope theres someone out there with a bigger pot of gold that youve got and who are a bigger club than you are
3255516 theres also lots of players with big egos and some of them might not want to put their necks on the line to make the move they have to be big enough to stand up and be counted but theres situations where people are just very comfortable at clubs even if theyre not playing
3255517 dave had an opportunity to go to a much bigger premier league club and earn a lot more money and i think it shows the type of lad he is that he kept his word and came to us
3255518 ive always been selective in what i want and i do care for the chairman and the football club so youve got to be careful
3255519 some managers are quite happy to spend an absolute fortune but if they get it wrong they go back to the board and want more money but we cant do that at stoke city were not that type of club
3255520 its just very exciting that we have the opportunity to compete with some of the best players clubs and managers in the world
3255521 everybody wants to play manage or be part of the premier league so these are exciting times for everyone at the club

3255551 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3255552 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3255553 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3255554 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3255555 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3255556 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3255557 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3255558 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3255574 meget tyder p at der er sket et skred i danskernes holdning til at forbruge for l nte penge og det er is r et problem for unge som typisk har privat konomier der er svage og lette at v lte
3255575 det er jo penge som skal betales tilbage selvom de allerede er brugt vi ser efterh nden flere og flere unge som har l nt s mange penge til forbrug at de ikke har r d til at studere fordi der skal tjenes penge til afdrag et godt r d er derfor at undg dyre l n og f rettet op p konomien hurtigst muligt og helst inden december s det er muligt at komme igennem julen uden nye overtr k og l n

3255579 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3255580 first of all in terms of the amount of money spent by advertisers it is so small that it doesnt divert from broadcast tv money the other reason is that in terms of the time spent using online tv services it is actually very small
3255581 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom
3255582 advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3255583 there is an apparent paradox or dilemma around how audiences can be up and ad revenues down but one reason that explains it is because demand for tv advertising is flat
3255584 this means there has been an increase in the supply of ads in the market and that means prices dropping you could say that eyeballs have never been cheaper in the last 20 years
3255585 clients are looking at cutting costs not expanding in this market
3255586 so it is actually not that great news that commercial impacts are up as this means that prices are down

3255593 its going to be tough to make this team ive got three more games to prove myself
3255594 its just something we do we do it in the offseason and we come back and crown a champion they have a good time
3255595 last year we had a great time you get a chance to talk to more guys than you do during camp
3255596 like the offensive and defensive linemen are fighting every day in camp were always accusing each other of holding or hitting the face mask when you do something outside of football you get a chance to know a guy and what type of person he is
3255597 we felt that was something that had to take place for him to be able to play this year
3255598 its very important because we know what type of player and person he is
3255599 weve got to know that hes going to be available
3255600 were not going to push him too soon but its important than he push himself so we can see how far he comes in the next few weeks
3255601 i did well last week hopefully we can keep it going and not have any more setbacks
3255602 its always difficult sitting and watching you want to get out there and get back to the feel of things you go out and play hard and give it everything you have
3255603 we played him at free safety but strong is his more natural position
3255604 he had good otas organized team activities hes worked extremely hard hes had a good training camp so far hes a very diligent guy hes in here at 6 30 in the morning watching tape trying to get better we expect his fourth year to be big for him

3255790 when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience
3255791 he is a cute and conservative chap whose idea of wild is argyle socks the once wondrous woman could also soundly state but its okay i like straight guys id never go out with anybody whos as irresponsible as me most of the guys i know have really high powered jobs and make up for lost time when theyre not in the office the beserk after work club i seem to attract them in a big way all these boys in paul stuart suits with six figure salaries and hellfire on a dimmer switch in their eyes
3255792 men ive never met any theyre all boys i wish i didnt want them so much i hate being alone but when i wake up in some guys bed and hes snoring like a garbage truck i go let me out of here
3255793 if you cannot be with the one you love love the one you are with
3255794 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work
3255795 this cat does extensive research i mean he puts in the kind of research that like james lipton would have his crew do on largehearted boy
3255796 i was interviewed by a very bright and engaging fellow
3255797 wow do i tell him things i wouldnt expect to say in an interview hes that good its the closest ive come to being on pamela ribon
3255798 very seldom do i get to say all these things because im not asked about them and i appreciate your asking
3255799 hes a funny smart guy and asked a lot of good questions
3255800 one of the great literary interviewers of our time listen for how often his subjects are struck by his discovery of an unknown to them pattern of imagery or tic of diction
3255801 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
3255802 i know who you are i know exactly what you do
3255803 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
3255804 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
3255805 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
3255806 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
3255807 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
3255808 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts

3255811 that should be good enough to add about 10 12 percent additional capacity
3255812 there are no indications of a slowdown now neither do we see a reduction in sales invoicing nor deferring of projects
3255813 there is no solution to it because power projects require long gestation periods
3255814 we would like to make it 100 percent pass through and we are trying our best to educate our customers
3255815 so we can get into long term assured supply contracts but we cannot get into long term price contracts
3255816 when we look at more localised studies and reporting we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers
3255817 the russian general staff has failed to learn the lessons of the chechen war
3255818 why was general khrulev operating within the troops combat formations where was the security force and indeed was there one khrulev was accompanied in his vehicle by journalists the tv guys were probably constantly calling people yet it is already clear that the georgian special forces trained as they are by us instructors react to emissions from telephones and radio sets where is the principle of the secure command and control of troops the army commander is directing thousands of people does he have any time or need for journalists in an engagement
3255819 according to information from the conflict zone russian aircraft from 4th air force and air defense army also are delivering strikes against georgian positions that army has around 60 su 24 front bombers 100 mig 29 fighters 60 su 27 fighters 100 su 25 attack aircraft 40 l 39 light attack aircraft and 30 su 24mr reconnaissance aircraft as well as 75 mi 24 attack helicopters and other aviation equipment

3255822 aunque las bajas pueden ser por diferentes motivos contrasta que el pasado a o y con estos mismos motivos hubo casi 12 000 bajas menos
3255823 no obstante tenemos que tener en cuenta que a partir del 1 de enero los agrarios por cuenta propia pasaron a cotizar al reta y este colectivo tiene unas tasas muy elevadas de jubilaci n lo que puede ser un motivo a adido para que el n mero de altas se dispare de esta manera

3255834 no nos han avisado de las obras ni nos han dicho cu nto van a durar qu hay que restaurar si fuera tan urgente no entendemos que coloquen este espanto de malla y la dejen ah durante un mes
3255835 no sabemos qu van a hacer no nos han contado nada ni a sanitarios ni a personal de administraci n
3255836 en los que se deja constancia de la peligrosidad que entra a el vial
3255837 en definitiva un problema de inseguridad vial causado por la negligencia municipal que ha aplicado la eliminaci n de las aceras en barrios enteros del centro y ahora no escucha a vecinos ni comerciantes
3255838 sin que de momento los responsables municipales hayan atendido sus reivindicaciones
3255839 lo que ha propiciado que se convierta un lado de la calle en aparcamiento y el otro en paso obligado de los coches
3255840 pone en riegos a viandantes y personas que salen o entran a sus viviendas ya que los coches pasan a escasos cent metros de las puertas

3255850 yesterday i went to a seminar and there was a pretty old lady there with white hair she said to us that kids have magic in their hands if someone is hurt you just put your hand on them and it sends energy and heals their pain so today we are going to use your small hands to make magic i want you all to put your hands on top of the container and send energy and love to the tiny seeds to help them grow

3255858 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the united nations security council but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
3255859 and i dont imagine that they were very happy that the syrians are demanding greater us involvement in the syrian israeli talks before agreeing to direct negotiations they also want to be involved
3255860 how dare the russians tell israel it cant sell arms to georgia when it is selling arms to damascus and teheran
3255861 if they sell arms to our enemies we can sell arms to theirs
3255862 we lowered our profile in georgia and the russians have also taken us into consideration and did not sell everything they could have to our neighbors
3255863 it has improved our position because we have leverage on russia we can now tell them if they sell offensive weapons here we can sell there we are also a player on this international field

3255872 joanne was a delightful child always friendly and very willing to join in and help in school she loved all kinds of activities and especially being on our school allotment where she spent many happy hours
3255873 she had so enjoyed a picnic on the farm that we are linked with on her last day in school she was a fun loving little girl very friendly and popular she enjoyed a joke and her personality sparked a great many will miss her she was a joy to know and teach our hearts go out to the family and we know everyone will want to support and help them
3255874 the whole street is upset it is horrible it is just really upsetting because you try and do what you can at the time and then to hear that she has passed away is very sad
3255875 you just start to think that if only i had done this or that but at the end of the day there is nothing else that i could have done i just helped as much before the ambulance came
3255876 we have needed speed bumps here for years i have been here for three years and in that time it has got a lot worse at all times of the day it is dreadful the cars and buses are going to fast
3255877 i could not stop shaking when i found out and to be honest i cannot stop thinking about the little girl at the time we thought that she was going to be okay once the ambulance arrived and rushed her to hospital people are very saddened by it
3255878 high government borrowing is a negative for interest rates and also for companies looking at raising money also with liquidity squeezed the investment activities of banks take a back seat

3255880 we are here to show that military aircraft can not only carry out terrible attacks but also commit crimes against the planet
3255881 you very rarely hear about the vast amounts of carbon dioxide military emit and at a time when we should all be accountable for our carbon footprint we should not be fighting wars over oil resources
3255882 even if you dont believe the wars in afghanistan and iraq are as counter productive as we do there is still a large amount of unnecessary flying
3255883 its just like any other health trend i tried it for a month and got sick it was the worst experience of my life

3255890 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3255891 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3255892 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3255893 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3255894 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3255895 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3255896 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3255897 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3255898 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3255899 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3255900 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3255901 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3255902 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3255923 i somehow want to get to a point within these next two fights to fight tough competitors where it will put me in line to fight someone that eventually is higher than me
3255924 eddie definitely deserves an opportunity also to fight for the title theres no doubt about it that eddie and nick diaz are 1 2 and theyre interchangeable
3255925 id like to discuss with eddie what his thoughts are id really like him to come and fight for elitexc before the year ends i also want to talk to eddie on how he feels about fighting joachim hansen because he really does deserve that title and we want to be fair to the kid at the same time i want to use him

3255945 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3255946 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3255947 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3255948 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3255949 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3255950 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3255951 you clash you are so clean and he is so messy
3255952 i tidy i clean and he doesnt care i dont think he like me he make my life hard he doesnt like me i really feel that
3255953 last week i tried my hardest and he comes today with water and pour it at me i wish hed appreciate it more just because i dont talk doesnt mean im not upset
3255954 thank you darnell i try so hard i dont think people like me i gave michael my bacon today and everything i feel people never feel like anything you do things for them and then nothing

3255965 hopefully when we get out we will we have friends here dont we

3255975 i go through the text making sure i havent used any long words if i find any fancy adjectives have crept in i replace them with small words like nice and big ive liked these words ever since i was told not to use them in english class at school after that i check that the sentences are short so as people wont get confused and i shorten all the chapters so they wont get bored i cant read anything complicated these days my attention span is too short everyone else probably feels the same

3255980 achievement seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistakes but they dont quit
3255981 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3255982 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3255983 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3255984 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3255985 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3255986 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3255987 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3255988 who are open to doing something on the production side
3255989 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3255990 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3255991 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3255992 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3255993 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3255994 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3255995 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3255996 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3255997 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3255998 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3255999 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3256000 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3256001 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3256002 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3256003 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3256004 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3256005 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3256006 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3256007 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3256008 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3256009 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3256010 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3256011 we have enough game ideas to do about 10 geo wars games
3256012 we have enough game ideas to do about 10 geo wars games
3256013 we have enough game ideas to do about 10 geo wars games
3256014 we have enough game ideas to do about 10 geo wars games
3256015 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3256016 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3256017 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3256018 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3256019 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3256020 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3256021 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3256022 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3256023 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3256024 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3256025 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3256026 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3256027 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3256028 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3256029 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3256030 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3256031 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3256032 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3256033 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3256034 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3256035 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3256036 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3256037 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3256038 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3256039 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3256040 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3256041 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3256042 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3256043 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3256044 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3256045 it is hard to imagine con con to be less credible than congress
3256046 we proposed that the delegates of con con be elected at the same time as the presidential candidates of the 2010 elections
3256047 it is possible that senator pimentel is convinced that constituent assembly is better but in the opinion of akbayan the only participatory and democratic way is an elected constitutional convention
3256048 the repercussions will be more serious and far reaching if the constitutional reform process paving the way for a federal system is left to a con ass constituent assembly composed of congressional members with dismal records in asset reform
3256049 how can we trust the landed politicians forming a constituent assembly to craft a constitution when they did not perform well in terms of asset reform legislations
3256050 speaker prospero nograles recently gave pronouncements regarding his intention to remove the provisions on the 40 percent foreign ownership limit which are actually protective of the rights of the filipinos particularly the basic sectors
3256051 if this happens then the constitution that the lawmakers might draft would hardly be considered as reflective of the aspirations of the poor
3256052 there is no hidden agenda in this resolution no 10
3256053 promise me youll never swear your life away to any of your mistakes
3256054 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3256055 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3256056 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3256057 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3256058 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3256059 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3256060 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3256061 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3256062 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3256063 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3256064 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3256065 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3256066 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3256067 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3256068 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3256069 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3256070 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3256071 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3256072 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3256073 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3256074 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3256075 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3256076 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3256084 leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively and if market conditions further deteriorate additional markdowns may be necessary on this asset class
3256085 these mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by worsening market conditions further deterioration in the housing market and market activity reflecting distressed sellers
3256086 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3256087 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3256088 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3256089 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3256090 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

3256097 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3256098 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3256099 these factors may promote the long term use of proton pump inhibitors leaving patients at increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures
3256100 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
3256101 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk climate but they also provide the knowledge which will help to mitigate the consequences
3256102 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3256103 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3256104 thats the only way kids will be able to learn the skills theyll need to take care of themselves when they become adults
3256105 there have always been parents who would fit the definition of helicopter parents they used to be called overprotective parents but the idea of parents who hover over their children to shield them from possible distress is as old as parenting
3256106 questioning is not bad as long as parents are willing to listen and there is true dialogue
3256107 when it results in uncompromising demands however it can become a real barrier to the childs maturity and self reliance
3256108 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3256109 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3256110 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3256111 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3256112 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3256113 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3256114 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3256115 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3256116 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3256117 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day

3256119 citys stock should be high instead thaksin has turned them into a laughing stock
3256120 there are lots of players with big egos and some of them might not want to put their neck on the line were a little bit behind in bringing players in we have found it a little bit difficult to bring in the quality that we want its highlighted one or two weaknesses we have as a football club but we are growing we are looking to push on and improve on what weve achieved there is money available but its finding the right ones
3256121 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that the rangers supporters have been fantastic but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back i want to thank them for everything

3256126 the premier league is facing an unprecedented trial of its fit and proper persons test after arrest warrants were issued for the manchester city owner thaksin shinawatra in thailand yesterday in what would be an unprecedented case the premier league would take legal advice before making a decision that could result in thaksin having to sell his stake in manchester city whether the league would recognise a conviction in thailand should thaksin receive political asylum has yet to be determined the league could yet be spared that difficulty if thaksin elects to sell the club although a city spokesman yesterday said the businessman has no such plans
3256127 thaksin shinawatras legal and political problems have radically altered the ambition that enticed hughes from blackburn rovers 10 weeks ago doubts over thaksins ability to realise his goal of taking city into the champions league hardened last week when it was confirmed he had appointed an intermediary to hold
3256128 john wardle the former chairman was required to lend the club 2 million last month so that staff could be paid he has since been repaid in full with all staff having received their wages but the clubs apparent need to accept his offer of a short term loan suggests that citys financial position is even more parlous than recent revelations had suggested
3256129 leaving aside images of rotten apples what is beyond dispute is that thaksin has brought embarrassment on city and english football the sooner the premier leagues chief executive richard scudamore sits down with thaksin and tells him to quit english football the better the frustration with thaksins presence at eastlands is that city were so close to being hailed as a serious club again citys stock should be high instead thaksin has turned them into a laughing stock
3256130 the fans jitters were not eased by a farcical sequence of events on saturday which gave rise to rumours of irelands exit too danny mills back from his latest loan spell at derby declared live on five before coverage of citys friendly against milan that the irishman had failed to show up and appeared to be leaving the club but he was not furnished with some farcical pre match events hughes it seems had told those players not selected for his squad named on friday to expect a text message on saturday if they had been stood down from substitutes duties ireland selected in hughes first xi misunderstood expected a text message and did not turn up when it did not arrive he was then surprised to find mark bowen hughes deputy on the phone asking why he had not shown
3256131 a city source said this is not the dream package sold to mark
3256132 there is no reason to think that wealthy owners dont cause more problems than they solve indeed everton had a moneybags backer a decade ago in hamper millionaire peter johnson who left the club with colossal debts evertons finances have nonetheless been managed well enough to allow them to break their transfer record in each of the last two summers in the meantime a manager whom kenwright has stuck by through some thin times has taken the team to three top six finishes in the past four years maybe david moyes would have done even better if the club was owned by some international financier with homes in every continent its equally likely that everton would be on their fourth manager in as many years and marooned in the bottom half of the table or worse
3256133 further quizzed on whether he preferred his players to be married capello concurred and did a lot of genial mugging that implied that colleen would have her husband on a short leash then the subject turned to a recent photograph that showed rooney drawing on a cigarette and capellos lack of interest in making a judgment revealed that the difference between football people in europe and britain is not merely a matter of tactics or technique the fact is smoking is not seen as the great taboo for a sportsman abroad that it is here
3256134 there is certainly no confidence lacking in the manager who was speaking at an event held at wembley by the football associations
3256135 neither arsenal or liverpool have the strength in depth to challenge for the title
3256136 arsenal like liverpool could contend forcefully for the european cup nonetheless the financial restrictions make it improbable that wengers team will take the premier league and if cash ever does flow freely one doubts whether the ascetic frenchmans pride will allow him to spend it so gaudily in the transfer market as manchester united or chelsea
3256137 in an attempt to shoehorn frank lampard michael ballack michael essien and deco into midfield the brazilian is planning to start the season with a 4 1 4 1 or 4 2 3 1 formation which relies on the full backs to provide width bosingwa is the most attacking full back at the club and is likely to flourish in such a system while ashley cole can also look forward to being given more licence after his natural instincts were stymied by jos mourinho and avram grant
3256138 joe cole is demanding assurances over his future from chelsea manager luiz felipe scolari after liverpool declared an interest in the england midfielder cole fears he will be frozen out of the starting xi when the barclays premier league season starts against portsmouth on sunday and he has also been spooked by the potential arrival of robinho liverpool boss rafa benitez who believes he has been priced out of a move for aston villas gareth barry is aware of coles predicament and is prepared to make a move if chelsea indicate a willingness to sell
3256139 i think the players interchanging and the way in which they do is different than united teams ive played in the past the front three or four now seem to be able to play in all positions and its difficult for opponents and defenders of the other teams they dont know who theyre going to be playing against from minute to minute let alone match to match
3256140 of course arsenal fans would be devastated if henry joined their biggest rivals in their book there is no worse crime but look at this sensibly thierry who turns 31 on sunday still has bags to offer and only a few years left to show it for one reason or another he hasnt had the kind of success at barcelona hed have probably hoped for if he is out for one last move then he will want to come back to england where everyone loves him and he can be the main man again other than arsenal theres only one team for a player of that calibre and thats united

3256149 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
3256150 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces

3256153 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
3256154 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that

3256157 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3256158 no currently available method enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3256159 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3256160 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3256161 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3256162 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3256163 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3256164 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves
3256165 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3256166 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3256167 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3256168 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3256169 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3256170 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3256171 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3256172 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3256173 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3256174 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3256175 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3256176 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3256177 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3256178 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3256179 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3256180 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3256181 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3256182 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3256183 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3256184 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3256185 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it workedperfectly
3256186 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3256187 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3256188 what is surprising is that such effects may pop up seventy or eighty years after birth
3256189 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens
3256190 the gap in understanding of single bond and multiple bond breaking processes is just incredible
3256191 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3256192 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3256193 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3256194 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3256195 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3256196 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3256197 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3256198 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3256199 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3256200 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3256201 refractive error is therefore the most common condition affecting the ocular health of the u s population involving young adults middle aged persons and older adults of all ethnicities
3256202 accurate current estimates of the prevalence of refractive error are essential for projecting vision care needs and planning for provision of vision care services to the many people affected
3256203 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3256204 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3256205 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3256206 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3256207 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3256208 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3256209 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3256210 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3256211 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3256212 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3256213 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3256214 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3256215 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3256216 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3256217 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3256218 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3256219 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3256220 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3256221 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that
3256222 without a current inventory you cant write a street tree management plan
3256223 they dont want to break down it takes a long time for wood to rot it even takes termites a long time to break wood down and theyre pretty good at it ethanol producers face the same problem because of the way these molecules are arranged its difficult to get access to the reactive centers in wood and other biomass what we have done is to study some of the most basic reactions associated with the breakdown of these materials
3256224 small but significant step toward maximizing the efficiency of biomass utilization

3256228 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3256229 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3256230 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3256231 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3256232 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear
3256233 academic ecological papers are often tinseled with one or two sentences about the applied significance of the science which accomplishes little
3256234 two people died when security forces opened fire at a protest rally we are collecting more details
3256235 weve said as a group that we believe that thats making the eight now out of our control it really comes down to others winning and losing having an impact on where were going
3256236 were not even looking at the eight we saw the win last weekend in being the situation where that controlled our opportunity to make the eight and we lost that opportunity
3256237 so now its out of hands and in the hands of others
3256238 i indicated to bruce that i would like to have him as a part of my team
3256239 bruce indicated to me he had a lot of issues major issues in his electorate and would like more time there
3256240 its no secret mr springborg and the national party are intent on exploiting factional divisions within the liberal party to further destabilise and weaken its conservative partner
3256241 a weakened liberal party wracked by infighting is much easier to dominate and control
3256242 mr nicholls promotion signals the return of the former senator santo santoro forces to dominate the liberal party
3256243 weve never really fallen down on policy on many occasions its been editorialised weve had the best policy
3256244 its been our structure and its been our lack of understanding probably of the contemporary values of queensland which has probably let us down
3256245 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3256246 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3256247 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3256248 i think itd have very little effect in the long run
3256249 it will be a very small effect but there will be an effect i think itll be delayed probably over two or three years whatever the final effect will be
3256250 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year
3256251 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3256252 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree
3256253 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference
3256254 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums
3256255 id have to say its nowhere near the five per cent range that a number of people have talked about
3256256 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3256257 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3256258 i think he performed well today though he didnt get a gold medal

3256260 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3256261 its not surprising that auckland is finding itself very much at the epicentre of the current economic recession and in particular the continued fallout from the finance sector collapses and its therefore understandable that confidence in the auckland residential market at this point is pretty low

3256299 whether a particular shoe is right for an individual depends on several considerations fit consumer reports found that most of the shoes provided at least a good fit for most panelists but there were exceptions for example while testing the top rated mens nike air zoom vomero 2 two panelists complained of pressure under the balls of their feet cushioning running can be hard on feet and joints shoes should provide enough cushioning to absorb impact the mens and womens nike air zooms provided excellent cushioning in consumer reports tests stability a stable shoe controls motion in the ankle among the mens models all but the champion earned a very good score for stability but only half of the womens models performed as well as the mens counterparts flexibility the front of the shoe should flex enough to let the runner push off with the ball of the foot the mens and womens nike air pegasus the stiffest breathability shoes that dissipate sweat quickly keep feet cooler and reduce the risk of bacterial or fungal infection weight the lighter the shoe the better as long as cushioning and stability dont suffer consumer reports offers the following tips for choosing a running shoe analyze gait the shoes consumer reports tested are for runners who dont require corrective measures but manufacturers also offer models for special needs for example for people who pronate roll inward excessively or not enough bring in well worn running shoes when shopping their wear pattern may help a salesperson analyze a runners gait which could lead to a better fitting running shoe get expert advice consumers will probably pay more at an athletic footwear store than they would at a discount store but theyre more likely to find a seasoned salesman who can help them get the best shoe for their needs take a test run buying shoes without trying them out is like buying a car without test driving it shoppers should ask if they can buy the shoes jog briefly on a treadmill at home or at a gym and return them if they dont feel right

3256305 lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes
3256306 while supporters like you are out knocking on doors registering new voters and organizing in your local communities our opponents are not even trying to match your efforts instead theyre spending millions to spread the smear that barack is just a celebrity and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans

3256309 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3256310 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country there is no possible justification for these attacks
3256311 what john mccain is trying to do is to remind people of what hes been telling them all along it is a dangerous world out there
3256312 you can overplay your hand and come across as too bellicose for your own good
3256313 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3256314 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3256315 i cant imagine that very many americans would support any kind of military role for the united states
3256316 probably for a lot of voters it would reinforce the idea that some people already have that perhaps mccain is a little bit too eager
3256317 state elections systems have shown signs of stress and theres a serious concern that they wont be able to handle the number of voters
3256318 when you get so many new registrations like that at record numbers its very difficult for people to monitor the validity of it
3256319 we dont have a real history in the last 10 to 15 years of large scale voter fraud
3256320 what we do have a problem with is getting everyone on the rolls and making sure their votes are counted
3256321 state and local parties have the primary responsibility for monitoring local voter registration and identifying problems
3256322 our view is that advance monitoring of legal developments can avoid real legal problems later on especially on election day
3256323 were all for getting people involved in the process and getting them to the polls
3256324 what were not for is registering fake people at fake addresses and creating barriers to trying to identify voter fraud where it exists which is everywhere its a growing problem because of the professional vote fraud denier industry

3256342 you felt it early there were some strange plays and it turned into back and forth
3256343 we didnt pitch well enough from the beginning plain and simple
3256344 we threw too many pitches we had too many walks and too many hit batters
3256345 we got up early came back late we all just battled and got it done
3256346 i think the guys have shown a tremendous ability to stay focused but tonight there were some things that should have been handled a little better than they were
3256347 i gave up four runs in the first inning thats unacceptable i pretty much stunk tonight
3256348 he looks like hes primed to go ahead and be the guy that we need
3256349 i dont think hes had the best luck in the world this year
3256350 im not thinking about my start six weeks from now
3256351 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3256352 its just frustrating for us to have danks pitch as well as he did and not come out of there with the win

3256359 i kind of slacked off a little during the super 14 so it was a good chance to get back with auckland in the npc because my confidence went down
3256360 they told me to put my head down and go back and work hard with the auckland npc team and get my fitness back up there
3256361 there wasnt really any area of my game they just told me to go back and work for me its probably my fitness first and also my defensive lines
3256362 i kind of slacked off a bit the last few games during the super 14 so those were the two things i wanted to work on
3256363 ive got to make up a lot of ground for the start i had the last time
3256364 tonight i stayed focused on what the plan was and executed my pitches thats pretty much the difference from being good and being horrible
3256365 obviously you start the game off and youre down by one or two runs all of a sudden youre backs against the wall you want to steer clear of it
3256366 it wasnt like they hit him hard anytime you throw the way he did its a tough one to lose
3256367 games like this are what i need to get past the previous start
3256368 not only did i pitch well i pitched well in a game i needed to
3256369 its not like i got a whole lot of action either
3256370 its hard to throw better than he did tonight he had good command he located very well he had good stuff

3256380 president bush has responded to the current russian invasion of georgia with words not weapons if russia can invade neighbors with impunity the western alliance is dead putin is seeking to install a client regime in georgia we are reliving 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia

3256431 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3256432 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3256433 ive gone from a naive 15 year old in sydney to an under pressure 18 year old in athens to a 22 year old now and i guess im sort of relieved
3256434 i just went out there and executed my race plan and thought of nothing else just did what i had to do
3256435 i was probably as low as you could get after athens
3256436 when you work so hard and put everything into it and when youre told youre the best swimmer in the world and you cant be beat its difficult basically my whole life worth was based on winning olympic gold
3256437 i know who the believers are and this is for them criticism is ok it makes this more worthwhile
3256438 ive only been working with rohan for a year and i think in that year ive gained twice as much experience as what i had in the past eight years
3256439 we got medals in the event were not that good in
3256440 and getting third in the 200 free four years ago you know when i do lose in a race like that and in circumstances like that it motivates me even more to try and swim faster
3256441 i think over the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 free
3256442 i couldnt ask for anything else so far from my first three medal races
3256443 weve done everything that ive wanted to do so far
3256444 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history and the olympics have been around for so many years is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3256445 its definitely an honour ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and exchange a few words with spitz here and there so its pretty amazing
3256446 just about every morning i have woken up at about 4 30 or 5 oclock it takes me a while to fall back to sleep and when i do fall back i get an extra half an hour

3256450 unfortunately hes at the opposite end of the athletes village and our track times have been the opposite but we are certainly spending every spare minute we have together
3256451 thats pretty huge having us race at the same time
3256452 they are great competitors but im probably not one to really dwell on my competitors
3256453 i honestly believe it if you work hard and you are honest and you have the work ethic and integrity you should be able to go out there and perform to your very best
3256454 i played inside the box my whole career in the nfl being down there with the big boys is really nothing new to me

3256469 even though we are not in beijing we see that everybody here is really into the games there were more than 90 000 fans watching football in just two days i think that shows how much interest there is
3256470 i think that it is an amazing atmosphere and i think that the people have been great and the support at the stadium has been great
3256471 when i came over the top of the conveyer belt and saw that many people around the stands it didnt feel like any less of an olympics
3256472 we were watching it on tv like all the fans back home
3256473 its not everybody who has the time or the money to go to beijing if they didnt bring some of these competitions to near us there was no way we could have watched the games im just glad they did now we can say we were part in the beijing olympics too

3256519 on wednesday west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharya rang me expressing desire for having the project in his state
3256520 the west bengal information technology secretary has also written to us inviting the company to set up the project there
3256521 i dont wanna take to much away from his win today he did a big job carrying 58
3256522 he got back off them a bit but i think he is better on the wet
3256523 i felt at ballarat i know he was under pressure but i always felt that i was going to go home and win
3256524 today i was off the bit a long way from home and he was racing under pressure only just because he is tough and he has a dip that got him there
3256525 brads horse had momentum mine was flat to the board and had nothing more to give to his credit he just kept giving he will win more
3256526 all i can do is be me whoever that is
3256527 the way that country music and rock is such a separate industry here its nice to think we might f it up a little bit and that they might not know where to play our records
3256528 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3256529 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3256530 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3256531 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3256532 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3256533 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3256534 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about

3256587 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
3256588 god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
3256589 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved
3256590 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
3256591 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
3256592 whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him
3256593 for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened
3256594 all who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law for it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in gods sight but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous indeed when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing now even defending them this will take place on the day when god will judge mens secrets through jesus christ as my gospel declares
3256595 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord

3256779 persoonlijke gaaf initiatief inderdaad volg het al enige tijd en vind het concept ik zou het aantal trends tot de top 5 beperken deze zijn
3256780 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3256781 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3256782 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3256783 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3256784 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud leiweke said i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us
3256785 the chosen layer break does not satisfy dual layer requirements to fix this either set a new layer break manually or choose to set the layer break automatically
3256786 to medal instead he had lost his head not in the entertaining sense of being decapitated or doing his nut but in a meandering forgetful way he was at the olympics and then he wasnt cest la whats the word ah yes vie
3256787 at the end i knew what to do its just
3256788 and i did the right thing its just hes ranked higher hes older more experienced and comes from a strong fencing nation
3256789 i dont think we have to drill everywhere but i guess i dont know what the problem would be to drill in anwr i do think we need to be energy independent
3256790 if these folks are going after lidio rainaldi they are wasting their money
3256791 dude regarding the readers that say those hippies were stolen from an album well dude maybe the album hippie came from somewhere else check
3256792 i am still staying wherever i can i stay at my ex fiances house while he is at work when he gets home i have to leave i sleep in my car amp even spent one night in his storage shed out back it sure gets hot in there i have learned not to trust everyone anymore i am a lot more cautious now

3256795 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy
3256796 we think we made the best demo released all year
3256797 personally speaking i dont believe it is possible to even capture the essence of this new burnout experience and i use the word experience there deliberately because this new burnout is an experience that you choose how to play rather than us forcing a game structure on you when the rest of you get to play the full game i am confident you will agree in a single demo
3256798 always nice to see all those gamecube owners on the internet who havent played the game since b2
3256799 as for no online racing in the demo well there was a limit on how much of our work we wanted to give away for free if you want to experience the rest of it then you have to buy the game
3256800 we feel that a crash experience where you choose when to start and stop it you choose where to play it and you experiment with is way better than anything we built before
3256801 the lack of retry really isnt an issue you may disagree but we dont feel it is and retry would have introduced loading into the game which we didnt want to do
3256802 at least we used to write special tips for our load screens when we did them most people simply do nothing
3256803 i hope that this answered a few questions if it didnt then oh well at least we tried
3256804 unfortunately for rock band users harmonix has been unwilling to discuss an agreement that will allow us to provide that option in a manner that maintains the high standards people have come to expect from activision we believe we should be compensated for the use of our technology
3256805 we are really and truly not looking at this from the financial standpoint we are looking at this from the consumer standpoint
3256806 the variety is both the blessing and the curse of the game its like nintendo are handing out the nicest sweets in the world and you taste one and think wow thats amazing give me another and then they say no have this other amazing one and its just as good but in a different way you fancy another of those or maybe even a taste of the first but then the third tastes possibly even better and so on and so on ive never known a game use so many ideas once and then throw them away its almost too generous in places
3256807 we have a large number of immigrants that need to be represented
3256808 its important for people to come out and talk about what is happening in harrisonburg and what they would like to see happen and what they perceive are the issues
3256809 all you have to do is walk into a plant or onto a construction site and you can see what an important role they are playing
3256810 about embracing the immigrants of our country the frustration has been over the laws
3256811 i hope a diverse cross section of our population will speak
3256812 if you throw me in the lineup in that series its definitely going to make the difference
3256813 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
3256814 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
3256815 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
3256816 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
3256817 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of
3256818 james mirtle bats out one heck of a hockey blog
3256819 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
3256820 her closest friends and family havent heard from her since may
3256821 she has no drivers license no vehicle no bank account no credit card and she left her cell phone behind
3256822 that does give us some concern usually when you go missing you have some means of support but that doesnt look like its the case in this situation
3256823 im sure i will calm down and realise i finished fourth in an olympic final but at the moment its just so painful to look up at that scoreboard and be so close to gold
3256824 it went much better than yesterday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that

3256832 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3256833 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3256834 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3256835 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3256836 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3256837 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3256838 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3256839 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3256840 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3256841 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3256842 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3256843 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3256844 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3256845 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3256846 the way hes attacking the meet hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything
3256847 i knew taehwan was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150

3256863 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3256864 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3256865 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3256866 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3256867 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3256868 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3256869 hey you appear to be on fire would you like me to help you
3256870 just my museum pot this pot caught my attention because of the strong red colour luck
3256871 if this is the age of environment then information will be the key to change in our lifestyle in policy and in practice and this we have conceived of the india environment portal
3256872 it will actively collate and exchange data research and information from people working in the field in campaigns in scientific institutions in research and in industry this best practices directory will help each person in doing more to protect the environment
3256873 this is a unique effort as it will provide a collaboration between government and civil society it is our effort to put government information in the public domain and to build dynamic and networked knowledge based society
3256874 the aim is to bring information from diverse sources on to one platform

3256894 dont let the informal nature of these communications lead us to be less than cautious about the contents and inadvertently create a contract
3256895 with a place like this where you dont have a lot of seating you can take care of more people and you can cut down on your employees

3256919 dont wait for the day of the battle before getting your weapons ready
3256920 no one knows the paths in a garden better than the gardener
3256921 if the fighting spread to other areas in mindanao then the talks will surely be at risk
3256922 the civilians are drawn into this unnecessary conflict many are suffering because of this fighting
3256923 we are on an offensive position there is little we can do now because of the continued government offensive against the milf in north cotabato we just hope this fighting will soon end
3256924 we will not compromise the lives of the civilians residing in the affected areas
3256925 milf forces are abiding by orders to reposition but militias and troops are firing on them
3256926 we want to dislodge them from villages until all the areas are cleared so civilians can return peacefully
3256927 amending the constitution is solely with the philippine government it does not matter to us as long as muslims will have their own homeland
3256928 the problems in mindanao are deeply rooted and federalism especially when it is raised with sinister intentions to entrench oneself further into power cannot resolve this
3256929 it cannot even be seen as a step towards the resolution of conflict clearly the call for federalism is meant only to give president arroyo the much needed opportunity to mess with the constitution and assure the extension of her term
3256930 a blog is a personal page is a time logbook is expression is someone saying what they think reckon believe for those who want to read it there arent bloggers union wages holidays but we do lots of overtime a blogger is not a journalist or an advertising agent they can be everything and nothing teenager or mother hairdresser or ceo each one has the audience they deserve the credibility they have conquered

3256945 i came out of the trials with a lot of confidence
3256946 there were cameras everywhere and much bigger crowds than i was used to
3256947 at first i was pretty nervous but toward the end i came to my senses and figured this thing out
3256948 doing well in the finals was really good for me because i wasnt very happy with some of my dives in the semifinals

3256955 theyre not mutually exclusive and ive said previously that our job is to run the bank for the interests of st george shareholders
3256956 the proposal by westpac is subject to it being in the interests of shareholders and clearly weve put that to the market place
3256957 westpac would know from its due diligence process the underlying performance of the group and so does the market
3256958 and then parallel to that weve also got the independent experts report being progressed as well
3256959 i can only deal with what ive got at the moment which is lots of transparency around the business to the market
3256960 every time we stand up for our rights were being condemned for it
3256961 we have contributed more than our fair share to this problem

3256963 global warming is an abstract idea that is hard for people to connect to

3256973 ich habe hier eine schriftrolle f r dich sie beinhaltet die namen derer die mit deiner mutter und mir zusammen in der brennenden legion k mpften und von denen ich informationen habe dass sie noch leben dar ber hinaus will ich dir mein amulett schenken
3256974 das kannst du nicht machen mirrador die zeit bei der brennenden legion hat dir soviel bedeutet und dieses amulett ist das letzte was dir geblieben ist was dich an diese zeit erinnert ich kann dieses geschenk nicht annehmen

3256976 ich danke dir mirrador ich verspreche dir ich werde mein bestes geben um all die anforderungen und erwartungen zu erf llen die ihr alle an mich stellt ich werde sowohl vater als auch mutter finden und gemeinsam mit ihnen die brut baiums aus dieser welt schaffen und hierher zur ckkehren ich werde den gleichen weg einschlagen wie die beiden um dieses ziel zu erreichen ich m chte die gleichen erfahrungen sammeln um so stark zu werden wie sie

3256986 we want littlebigplanet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3
3256987 we have coined 2008 the year of the ps3 and are confident that with the launch of

3256990 based on the positive experiences we have gained with the per c6 r cell line and dsms manufacturing capabilities within our mor103 lead program we have chosen to continue to use this platform for mor202
3256991 we are very pleased that morphosys is extending its business partnership with dsm biologics as their preferred manufacturing partner after our highly successful collaboration on the mor103 program
3256992 it is exciting how well the combination of our two strong platforms works for fully human antibodies
3256993 new therapies are needed to improve outcomes in patients with advanced non gist soft tissue sarcomas this study is the second eortc study of brostallicin in soft tissue sarcoma the initial study used brostallicin as single agent salvage therapy in patients whose disease had progressed following initial chemotherapy the eortc considered the results in that trial to be of sufficient magnitude to conduct the current study using brostallicin as first line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have not received any prior chemotherapy
3256994 a standard of care arm doxorubicin is included as a reference arm although not used to determine comparative efficacy if the study results are encouraging a phase iii study in soft tissue sarcoma could be initiated in 2009
3256995 randomized phase ii study of brostallicin pnu 166196a versus doxorubicin as first line chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma
3256996 based on the results of the first eortc study with brostallicin we conducted the current study in patients with soft tissue sarcoma to further define the activity of this drug in this patient population
3256997 in the first study two patients treated with brostallicin had confirmed partial responses and many others had prolonged disease control such activity is rare in this group of patients and we very much hope to confirm or improve on those results and to expand our knowledge of brostallicin in the treatment of these patients
3256998 brostallicin represents a promising new agent with a unique mechanism of action for patients with metastatic sarcoma where there is a clear unmet medical need
3256999 the current standard approach for newly diagnosed patients with sarcoma is essentially limited to doxorubicin so clearly new treatment options are needed

3257001 these are things that have been thought out well in advance
3257002 its kind of tricky from a construction standpoint so the quicker we can turn that over to the contractors the quicker we can get it back to the fans

3257008 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3257009 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3257010 could exacerbate previously existing tensions between the camps of clinton and sen barack obama

3257014 ill do anything for the jonas brothers they have made my kids so happy and i just want to be on stage to see what its like to be a rock star
3257015 i got my mouth i got my teeth i got my tongue i got my chin i got my neck
3257016 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
3257017 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces
3257018 the ultimate freedom to stand there and have no clothes on and be your true self
3257019 if there was any place to get naked it would certainly be in central park doing hair groff says
3257020 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
3257021 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that
3257022 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3257023 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3257024 alas must it ever be so do we stand in our own light wherever we go and fight our own shadows forever
3257025 it was one of those spur of the moment things
3257026 in order to become involved with the obama campaign you have to have a connection if you sign up on the web site to volunteer and they dont get back to you its because they have a lot of people with work experience
3257027 its always hard the first time you dont know the right people dont know who to talk to and what meetings to attend
3257028 it seemed perfect i was looking for a bench anyway and i found a way to donate to the campaign
3257029 i didnt realize how young harry and emma were until they brought the bench over
3257030 i used to see cutesy things like kids having lemonade stands
3257031 but these two are building something that can last and making a lot more money than ive ever heard of
3257032 so its been a fun way to spend all day every day together
3257033 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3257034 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3257035 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3257036 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3257037 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3257038 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3257039 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3257040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3257041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3257042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3257043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3257044 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3257045 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3257046 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3257047 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life

3257049 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3257050 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3257051 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3257052 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3257053 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3257054 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations
3257055 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3257056 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3257057 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3257058 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3257059 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3257060 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3257061 were all getting to know each other and share ideas
3257062 we used the guidelines from the botanic garden which pointed out we were being judged not just on having bright beautiful flowers but on showing community spirit and involvement on showing a real understanding and caring for the trees and tree beds and on using the right kind of materials for our planters
3257063 it was fun just to see everyone out working together doing the mulching
3257064 and if the mulch didnt get them the wine did
3257065 this block won because they showed the most innovative citizen participation that ive seen in a long time
3257066 these gardeners had a very hard scape to deal with all of their gardening except for the street tree beds is container gardening
3257067 their tree guard is simple and inexpensive made of wood and chain links and costs about 30 we appreciated their thinking
3257068 we have the incentive to do more for next year
3257069 were going to get with the tenants who could do just a little better
3257070 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3257071 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3257072 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3257073 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3257074 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3257075 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3257076 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3257077 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3257078 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3257079 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3257080 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3257081 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3257082 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3257083 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3257084 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3257085 it started out as a feeling which then grow into a hope which then turn into a quiet thought which then turn into a quiet word and then that words grew louder and louder till it was a battle cry ill come back when you call me
3257086 we empower young people to be players and winners in the political game

3257090 the group claims that the mailers it sent out were not campaign materials

3257098 innocence flows from a natural harmlessness openness and pure intentions unsullied by ulterior motives the state of innocence has less to do with age than attitude innocence springs from a heart that remains open to joy and wonder innocence when guided by a firm faith in what is right brings supreme success naivete unanchored by an ability to discern right from wrong on the other hand brings misfortune the hallmark of innocence is a willingness to treat others with compassion and respect those who possess a pure heart are best guided by their instincts and intuition thinking too much on the other hand severs links with the guidance of the heart be wary of relationship strategies that require too much cleverness
3257099 hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all and sweetest in the gale is heard and sore must be the storm that could abash the little bird that kept so many warm ive heard it in the chilliest land and on the strangest sea yet never in extremity it asked a crumb of me

3257112 faith is a device of self delusion a sleight of hand done with words and emotions founded on any irrational notion that can be dreamed up faith is the attempt to coerce truth to surrender to whim in simple terms it is trying to breathe life into a lie by trying to outshine reality with the beauty of wishes faith is the refuge of fools the ignorant and the deluded not of thinking rational men

3257115 i can honestly say that since that first night when a tattered printed manuscript found its way to me thanks to one of my daughters my life has never been the same once you read it for yourself you will understand why

3257173 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3257174 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3257175 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3257176 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3257177 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3257178 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3257179 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3257180 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3257181 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3257182 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3257183 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3257184 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3257185 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3257186 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3257187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3257188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3257189 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3257205 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3257206 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3257207 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3257208 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3257238 i had been very critical of new zealands inclusion in the a league but i have got to honestly say my opinion has changed over the last year
3257239 theyve strengthened defensively and smeltzy is a very good player who i rate highly
3257240 what ricki did with them last year with such a limited pre season was fantastic the signings theyve made so far seem to be good and the psc was a good indication of that
3257241 theyve strengthened their team 10 fold really theyve shored up their defence and theyre actually very quick going forward we struggled to contain them at times in the pre season

3257247 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3257248 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3257249 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3257250 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3257256 we are very satisfied with the good trend in banking operations we are seeing sound and strong growth and are taking substantial market shares from our principal competitors the growth which is particularly strong in trondheim is profitable and we have a satisfactory risk trend on the other hand given the still restless financial market we have not recouped the capital losses sustained on the banks financial investments in the first quarter of the current year the financial turbulence is also the cause of lower profit contributions from sparebank 1 gruppen
3257257 we are very pleased that our core operations are doing well and that the second quarter result was substantially better than the first quarter

3257343 my impression of this group of guys is that theres a tremendous amount of character in this group of athletes and they want to prove that the usa is still a force to be reckoned with
3257344 i think this group weve got a lot of good athletes out there that want to stay with it and do what we can do
3257345 what were doing is were cultivating a culture if you will at the elite level a deeper program at the top and then were working with the elite juniors to keep them in the sport
3257346 thats why that diverse model is important we know were going to be challenged by a lot of the mainstream sports to keep kids interested you look at a male been doing gymnastics since they were 6 years old and theyre peaking at 24 25 thats a long time

3257350 certain pockets like in fox we believe is driven by enthusiast purchases and today those enthusiasts appear to continue to be making their purchases and business is growing dramatically

3257352 the folks at iron horse share my vision for building bikes with real proven suspension technology rather then concocting some gimmick to market for another few years before the next new gimmick
3257353 ellsworth and iron horse agree that the sport of mountain biking grows when folks have a fabulous ride experience on great performing frame designs ict equipped full suspension designs perform better have more energy and great comfort traction and control then any other suspension design
3257354 we believe folks having that level of experience will ride more and tell a friend and there will be more folks riding bikes promoting health and appreciating our planet in an environmentally responsible and healthy way
3257355 this is a very exciting time for our product development department we are looking forward to creating unique frame platforms that carry forward iron horses renowned ride characteristics the goal is to incorporate the key qualities from our existing models with benefits of the ict system
3257356 we are committed to produce well engineered world cup quality performance bikes

3257359 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
3257360 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
3257361 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics
3257362 the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics

3257402 you know that makes a lot of sense to me
3257403 if catholics believed what most non catholics think they believe i wouldnt be a catholic either
3257404 i believe a lot of the todays divisions between catholics and non catholics are to a great extent due to a misunderstanding of catholic teachings and doctrines
3257405 just as a large number of non catholic christians have misunderstandings of catholic teachings so i believe many catholics have misunderstandings of catholic teachings on ecumenism these misunderstandings can contribute to making the divisions even worse

3257488 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3257489 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3257490 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

3257493 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3257494 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3257502 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3257503 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3257504 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3257505 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3257506 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3257507 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3257508 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3257558 the recycling at a local level of glass plastic paper and metal was amazingly visible however sadly the casual and careless disposal of waste was also evident in many parts of our walk

3257560 get rich or die trying geld verdienen op het web volgens de black hat methode
3257561 have you ever wondered why young people take to music like fish to water maybe its because music is fun plain and simple it opens up their minds to dream great dreams about where they can go and what they can do when they get older
3257562 it dawned on me that this was something i could do after 18 years in plumbing i was ready to move on to something else and welcomed the opportunity i was coming home physically exhausted and trying to think of alternative work i was thinking i have to have the big idea i have to invent something the more i struggled to come up with an idea the less i was able to then i realised i didnt have to come up with something new i just had to do something incredibly well as a mechanic profile there is not that much difference between plumbing and balls it is a matter of working out a great system
3257563 the auckland team is led by the fabulous sylvia baker in brisbane by the magnificent lesley mclennan and in perth by rakish rasmus neilson singapore is steered by the casual collective of tim wade zubi khawaja myriam oliveres and gudrun neinaber in mumbai we have the brilliant ashwin thadani in dubai clever kk bose in cape town amazing hallid smith and in london the redoubtable tracy stallard they are fantastic people giving their time and energy because they believe in effective giving the hunger project and hattie
3257564 it was remarkable to see the strength of these women how they are achieving great things for their villages against the odds before the hunger project training they were walking around with veils over their faces and they didnt even have a name now they are being given a chink of power and trained to know how to use it at a womens conference we saw women in beautiful saris standing up proudly and saying they now had schools for girls and fresh water in their villages
3257565 by prioritising women the hunger project is putting resources into the entire community the empowerment work goes beyond the teaching a man to fish principle the project recognises that people quite often already have the skills they need instead it addresses crippling attitudes in order to overcome the generational trampling down of people it goes to heart of the basic principle that regardless of culture and customs all people deserve respect and a decent life
3257566 the thing about being a woman and being a plumber is the higher level of service the fact i turn up when i say i will and i talk to people about what im doing
3257567 in this country we laugh if someone gets diarrhea in africa or india you die if you get diarrhea we take for granted hygienic sanitation and fresh water in the west i empathise with girls and women who are doing the backbreaking work of walking miles to fetch water in poor countries once people meet the survival needs of water food and shelter and clothing they can be free to grow in other areas of life
3257568 as we encounter obstacles people seem to appear to help we are enlisting the support and expertise of the xl network which has proven to be an incredibly rich resource of enthusiastic and highly skilled people across all kinds of fields
3257569 whenever we ask what will we do about this problem the answer appears in the form of a who the right person shows up at exactly the right time and then the how question is automatically answered
3257570 we are building a product for the future the 2008 global ball will establish and consolidate our brand we are devising a ball formula and forming partnerships in countries around the world
3257571 imagine a cake mix where you just add eggs well we are devising a ball mix where you just add a creator the secret ingredient each extraordinary ball will follow a recipe but will be unique because of the individual creativity added
3257572 as a mechanic i want to see absolutely everything in place so that in the future when someone approaches us and says i want to do a ball we can go to our database and be all set to go
3257573 people are excited about the glamour the celebration and the fun of the event
3257574 i absolutely believe that putting on a ball at a time of credit crunch and fear about money is exactly the right time to do it because it gives us all a connection to people who are suffering real hardship living below the poverty line
3257575 there is a trend toward corporate social responsibility corporations have always been seen as the bad guys they are the ones who pollute and destroy the environment and cultures we might be cynical and think they are just saying they want to give back to improve their public image but if you can get a multinational to discover how good it feels to do something that is useful and has a greater meaning that will change them that transformation in the corporate world is as important as the transformation in the developing world
3257576 one of the points that has come across in my discussions with other european finance ministers is the widespread concern about the very high levels of profit taking and self reward that is taking place at the higher echelons of the private sector
3257577 i share that view it wouldnt do for employers to expect all the restraint to be on the part of the unions or the workers they have to lead by example it must be demonstrable and it must be verifiable
3257578 we did it without linkage to anything else and as a gesture of good faith i would like to see that kind of example being followed especially for the times we are in
3257579 social partnership has served ireland very well in the past and it has brought a track record of progress over 21 years i am very much of the belief that it is not at an end and that it can serve us just as well into the future although economic conditions are now more difficult
3257580 the taoiseach has asked all sides to reflect on the situation during this month and i too would ask all sides to consider what could be lost partnership is something that will have to be achieved again in some form and the well paid will i think have to face up to their responsibilities
3257581 dont forget that public service retirement lump sums and bonuses have now gone back to what they were before the pay award was introduced
3257582 big increases were scrapped and there is concern already about some of the very high packages we are seeing elsewhere
3257583 whether it is cuts or moderation or something else being given up we need to see that it has to be demonstrable and as i say any deal that is reached in the national interest has to be one that involves shared responsibility across the board
3257584 this requires a property to have a city address ie not county waterford
3257585 they first active are not willing to take a risk on rural locations which indicates they have no faith in anything outside of the cities
3257586 assume the assets and liabilities of this scheme and meet future liabilities as they arise on a pay as you go basis
3257587 this is simply creative accounting and will not reform anything or make it work better
3257588 if these schemes are funded is the government interfering and if the government position is that it guarantees these pensions anyway why are they funded by the institutions and their staff
3257589 it looks like they are trying to find money in any kitty they can rattle

3257617 tonight it is intended particularly for the kosovo situation and generally for serbians who live in serbia right now because of the tense situation there
3257618 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3257619 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3257620 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3257621 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3257622 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3257623 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3257624 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3257625 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3257626 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3257627 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3257628 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3257629 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3257630 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3257631 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3257632 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3257633 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3257634 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3257635 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3257636 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3257648 first amendment rights applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment are available to teachers and students
3257649 this christian consensus is easily verified by the fact that prior to 1789 the year that eleven of the thirteen states ratified the constitution many of the states still had constitutional requirements that a man must be a christian in order to hold public office
3257650 are not enjoined from praying either individually or in groups students may voluntarily pray together provided such prayer is not done with school participation or supervision
3257651 a school official cannot tell a student that he can t bring his bible to school or study it with friends during non classroom time
3257652 the constitution does not prohibit bibles during recess it prohibits the wholesale banning of bibles during recess
3257653 children have rights of speech and association during their non instructional time and the school may not curtail those rights because of their age
3257654 the school district should immediately issue a statement addressing the unconstitutional actions and policy and alerting all personnel to permit luke and other similarly situated students to exercise their constitutional rights

3257660 i think itd have very little effect in the long run
3257661 it will be a very small effect but there will be an effect i think itll be delayed probably over two or three years whatever the final effect will be
3257662 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year
3257663 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3257664 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree
3257665 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference
3257666 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums
3257667 id have to say its nowhere near the five per cent range that a number of people have talked about

3257669 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3257670 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3257671 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3257672 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3257673 most of the main roads in the provinces are covered with thick a layer of mud from landslides so it is very difficult for vehicles to move around

3257675 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3257676 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3257677 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3257681 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3257682 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3257683 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u s out we cant wait to see how china japan and
3257684 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3257685 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3257686 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3257687 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3257688 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3257689 how about proteins how am i gonna get enough proteins ive heard that a vegetarian diet doesnt include enough proteins is that true
3257690 where do i position my subject left right or in the middle
3257691 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3257692 first of all in terms of the amount of money spent by advertisers it is so small that it doesnt divert from broadcast tv money the other reason is that in terms of the time spent using online tv services it is actually very small
3257693 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom
3257694 advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3257695 there is an apparent paradox or dilemma around how audiences can be up and ad revenues down but one reason that explains it is because demand for tv advertising is flat
3257696 this means there has been an increase in the supply of ads in the market and that means prices dropping you could say that eyeballs have never been cheaper in the last 20 years
3257697 clients are looking at cutting costs not expanding in this market
3257698 so it is actually not that great news that commercial impacts are up as this means that prices are down
3257699 odds are its going to be a military guy or at least someone whos been in uniform and if not that someone with significant foreign policy experience
3257700 the trouble with barack obama is hes an unknown quantity right now
3257701 he is going to raise taxes and take away our hard earned money
3257702 a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet
3257703 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3257704 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3257705 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3257706 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3257707 what would you do if you received 50 messages or more per week from different senders offering products or services you do not want
3257708 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3257709 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3257710 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

3257720 i live in temqa and there was an air attack there last night we are very scared but we have nowhere to go to i feel very sorry about the war i cry for all the people who have been killed but the russians they dont like us i dont know when they will stop the attacks
3257721 together in the global war on terrorism we hope to promote georgian freedom and stability and to help you to fulfil your desire to live in a society free of threats
3257722 we certainly supplied them with weapons and i wouldnt be surprised if the guys back in dc knew what was going on
3257723 i feel a bit bad about that but hell we are fighting in iraq and afghanistan we cant fight all the worlds wars
3257724 so they are leaving it was not good for our government to rely so much on another country i cannot see how we can win this one russia is too powerful and we certainly cannot fight russia by ourselves it is very depressing but russia will walk away from this the big winner and georgia will maybe slip back 10 years
3257725 is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
3257726 the whole of south ossetia is in ruins the role of those who came here today is 100 per cent humanitarian they came to rebuild infrastructure
3257727 in the past two days about 2 000 people volunteered these are men with experience of military operations in hot spots
3257728 not one newspaper in the west has written the truth about whats happening here no one has written that the georgians were the ones who started this that they are the ones shooting women and children
3257729 its strange because ive lived around them all my life but im just so angry at the georgians if they let me fight i will
3257730 we have a lot of needs and my annual budget is about 30 million dollars a year and thats with all the funding sources combined
3257731 everybodys just going to be trying to survive with the local budget its tough we are here for education not construction but you have to have a building to have education
3257732 our schools are not in bad shape we are very very blessed in this county
3257733 in 2007 the baldwin county school board sought 150 million dollars of bond thats money on wall street weve got one of the highest bond ratings a school system can achieve on the bond market

3257739 tentative signs that housing activity may be nearing a floor
3257740 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market accessibility
3257741 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species going forward there are signs that sale activity might pick up a little as sellers start to revaluate unrealistic asking prices
3257742 on a good day its a couple of calls overnight
3257743 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3257744 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organisation
3257745 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3257746 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3257747 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3257748 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3257749 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3257750 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3257751 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3257752 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3257753 it is the funniest thing youve ever seen but also the most dangerous thing
3257754 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go
3257755 its only a matter of time before someone is killed
3257756 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3257757 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3257758 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3257759 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3257760 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organisations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3257761 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirises hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3257762 so far tropic thunder has generated no backlash against the 43 year old star of iron man
3257763 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3257764 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3257765 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3257766 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3257767 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3257768 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3257769 we are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia
3257770 we think it is due to the weather the humidity and then the rain and on the first couple of days there were not many spectators who showed up
3257771 there are also reserved seats for the olympic family that have not been taken up the preliminary rounds are sometimes not attended and people at other events have tickets for the whole day and do not attend the every event
3257772 if local venue managers find there are not enough people in the venue or too many empty seats they arrange for local volunteers as cheerleaders and they are told to cheer for both teams to create a better atmosphere if the ticket holders turn up then they get up and go
3257773 yesterday we saw that there were not enough people in the olympic green and we encourage more people to come local communities can apply for tickets and people from around china can come through travel agents
3257774 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3257775 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3257776 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3257777 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3257778 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud leiweke said i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us
3257779 the good thing is ive got a lot of time to get better
3257780 its how the guy works its his history its how he takes care of his body there are a lot of things that go into the equation you just hope youre right
3257781 he had as good an offseason as anybody on the football team
3257782 he knows that we need him on the field nobody has been shy about that
3257783 i felt very good with all of them upright and working
3257784 with this situation now it puts us in a tougher environment but if these kids are going to become players become big time players they need the work theyre fixing to get it
3257785 we showed everybody the heart and soul of this team
3257786 use your cancer to learn and grow and as a force to work for you
3257787 hence the situation that he has been detained does not exist
3257788 seven to eight plainclothes officers who beat me and dragged me and my brother hua huilin into two separate cars
3257789 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go
3257790 after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled but im afraid to go home
3257791 i havent heard from him weve been waiting here were so worried
3257792 my father asks me every day where he is and i tell him i dont know

3257805 short term memory is often the first thing to go right after ethics
3257806 what hannity means when he says nobody has made an issue of obamas race is he and limbaugh havent called him the n word
3257807 cant point to a single instance in which president bush or mccain or karl rove or sean hannity or talk radio or any other major republican has made an issue of obamas race
3257808 march 2nd of this year hannity said it seems that the change candidate has all the same problems with race as those before him
3257809 what hannity means when he says nobody has made an issue of obamas race is he and limbaugh havent called him the n word yet
3257810 cant point to a single instance in which president bush or mccain or karl rove or sean hannity or talk radio or any other major republican has made an issue of obamas race
3257811 it seems that the change candidate has all the same problems with race as those before him
3257812 its only fair to ask do the obamas have a race problem of their own
3257813 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid

3257822 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3257823 major investment banks are trying to protect their business reputations and their credibility by offering these kinds of settlements without regulatory action
3257824 theres a lot of pressure on industry players to follow suit
3257825 private equity players find it safer to invest in projects rather than a developer a lot of developers are also finding easy that way once a private equity fund enters the project suddenly becomes viable because it has the money to execute
3257826 even if the developer now takes loan which is difficult to get anyways where is the assurance that buyer is there
3257827 most mid size developers be it at the regional levels have taken over a lot of load all these people have got more projects than they can execute they have more agreements to buy land than they have money for they have applied for licenses but have no money for licensing fee and construction
3257828 we always invest at a project level as we see more value in it also it is a higher return game investing at the project level because if i invest say in a developer i pay a fee and my returns are reduced to that extent
3257829 now that the real estate pit has reached the bottom we can definitely find a few hidden pearls
3257830 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3257831 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3257832 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3257833 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3257834 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3257835 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3257836 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3257837 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3257838 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3257839 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3257840 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3257841 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3257842 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3257843 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

3257878 the big picture here is that delta and northwest pilots have done something that has never been done before in history that is to have a joint contract and a seniority list negotiated before the date of corporate closing thats hugely significant
3257879 the good thing is this will allow delta to be very successful in the coming years and will lead to a much better contract in the future

3258031 lots of things were on sale at this pub beyond beer and peanuts
3258032 the licensee had no relationship with the company this is the problem with the leasehold arrangement
3258033 we are pleased with the outcome and look forward to making a number of key improvements and recruiting a new licensee to re open the locomotive
3258034 we also have to look at the a1307 and ramsey forty foot as there are people dying up there too
3258035 few of the casualties on the a1307 are speed related but speed is always a factor in road traffic collisions
3258036 some members of the public are anti speed cameras and say they are a stealth tax but road traffic collisions in the county cost the nhs 80 million a year which is money that could pay for other things
3258037 average speed cameras save lives and save money the only people that pay are those who are speeding
3258038 its good if these cameras are saving lives but i am not a big fan of them i think more police on the ground and targeting tailgaters and dangerous drivers would save more lives
3258039 the road simply doesnt have the capacity for the people of cambridgeshire and urgently needs upgrading i would not take my family on it when its busy its just too dangerous

3258064 authorities should not issue pcns when traffic signs or road markings are incorrect missing or not in accordance with the tro these circumstances may make the order unenforceable if a representation against a pcn shows that a traffic sign or road marking was defective the authority should accept the representation because the adjudicator is likely to uphold any appeal an enforcement authority may be acting unlawfully and may damage its reputation if it continues to issue pcns that it knows to be unenforceable

3258094 when we think of slavery there are images that impose themselves upon us goree here and its
3258095 slavery is not just a scourge of yesteryear it is also a scourge today slavery is not just about whites against blacks it is also an affair of arabs against blacks of blacks against blacks and even arabs against whites it is a story totally removed from all of those that you have that we have been told until now
3258096 slavery a topical story not yesterdays news the proof if we continued the boat trip a few kilometers more north wed arrive in mauritania the mauritania that abolished slavery in 1981 the mauritania where slavery persists nevertheless
3258097 if ive come to see you its because my sister is still back there she remains a slave she fetches the water from the well she takes care of the herd she does the cooking she gets no rest she has two daughters one is paralyzed guess who their father is her master a man who will never acknowledge his children if you should see her you would see how she suffers
3258098 listen to me i could never be happy if i failed to free my sister from her slavery
3258099 we must end the crime of slavery here to put a stop to the existence of slavery separate the slaves from their masters this must be the first phase the second phase we must find a way to put the criminal slave owners in prison
3258100 officially these activists are sustained by the mauritanian government they are even mandated by the states national commission on human rights but in the field its another matter
3258101 there is an enormous amount of slavery in this bush country look at all these camps there are only slaves here because their masters during these hot periods the masters leave them to go to the city they leave the slaves to watch over the place
3258102 we are poor but it is better to be poor than a dependant to be free is to be alive and that is above any price
3258103 how did these men live when they were slaves chained with iron balls attached to their legs no they were condemned to toil at all the hard chores under the hot sun in their masters place a domestic slavery a tradional practice in mauritania so traditional that it is extremely difficult to eradicate it
3258104 they want to know if were terrorists here terrorists are militants for human rights
3258105 this shows the taboos that exist around this problem here they dont want to hear about human rights
3258106 an offical authorization from the national commission for human rights a state organization
3258107 we are both mauritanian citizens so let us resolve our problems between us we should not draw the attention of strangers on on very specific realities
3258108 slavery was abolished in mauritania three times in 1905 during french colonization in 1960 as part of its independance and in 1980 under military power but without real application now once again with the recent democritization of the country the public has re engaged in eradicating slavery in 2007 they promulgate a new law whomsoever reduces another into slavery will be punished with imprisonment for 5 to 10 years but this was written it is said for the sake of the international community for to criminalize slavery first it must be recognized this is not the case
3258109 nouakchott the national assembly for the ruling class the word slavery is taboo surprising not really the body is essentially composed of former masters
3258110 i dont think there are any slaves in mauritania no slavery there are after effects of slavery
3258111 yes for those who would be tempted to fall back on old reflexes
3258112 this law was demanded by national considerations this is a demand that some have made i dont know why but it was done and it was accepted to silence their tongues to shut up those who wish harm on mauritania in mauritania there are no slaves i defy anyone to prove to me one single case in mauritania
3258113 this is her masters decision to give her her liberty its dated august 12 2000
3258114 it is a personal paper from the master without any administrative witness
3258115 it is the master that certifies in his own handwriting that he frees his slave at this date
3258116 but you know that slavery has been abolished why do you need this paper
3258117 people have told me that the law was not valid that only my masters certificate was valid
3258118 here everyone sees slavery as a dogma of islamic religion it is part of a quasi religious submission to a master there are slaves that say they cannot disobey their masters because if they do they will go to hell god will punish them they believe that in disobeying their master they are disobeying god islam is not pro slavery but islam is also not particularly anti slavery islam does not de legitimize slavery
3258119 whos to say that this is a case of slavery
3258120 whoever says its not a case of slavery is someone who did not want to make an honest inquiry and is waiting to hear complaints that will never come because of how common the crime of slavery is the keeper of public law and order must initiate an inquiry himself because he defends society it is not about waiting for a person to arrive with a complaint
3258121 im not a slave im not a slave i am free i am a slave of allah i am not leaving the day has not yet arrived when i will leave with you
3258122 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3258123 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3258124 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3258125 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3258126 he is not worthy of his position the memorandum of agreement that supposedly marked a breakthrough in the peace negotiations with the moro islamic liberation front milf has failed to undergo a thorough and sincere process of consultation among stakeholders somebody has to take responsibility and heads should roll
3258127 esperon who has always been president arroyos go to guy in corrupt and baleful operations from the garci scandal to the human rights violations of the armed forces under his term should go

3258129 bringing about genuine peace and upholding peoples rights and interests could very well be the least of the governments intentions in its negotiations with the milf
3258130 inspiration for a new business can hit you at any moment
3258131 the secret lies in being able to harness that idea and quickly bring it to fruition in a cost effective manner
3258132 many budding entrepreneurs get too caught up with the massive amount of detail involved in creating a burgeoning companys infrastructure rather than focusing on the business itself
3258133 i advocate outsourcing the basics to those that specialize in this to be successful in this tough economic climate you need to focus 100 percent of your attention on your business model and customers
3258134 with streetsmart we were literally up and running with our twistbox branded email and everything in a matter of hours
3258135 and the best part was that we now had a sophisticated backbone upon which to build our business for less than most people spend on coffee in a month
3258136 when i first started building companies i looked far and wide at the various options out there and found that there is no better choice today in the marketplace than infostreets streetsmart when you compare service and cost infostreet is the perfect solution for mid to small sized businesses that want the capabilities of a big firm but dont have excess capital to just spend spend spend you would have to dedicate large sums to most other offerings to get the type of services that streetsmart offers us today all from one web based platform
3258137 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
3258138 im not fully satisfied with the speed it could have been a little faster
3258139 its a bit slow i was expecting that it would be faster eight hours or so
3258140 we should make it shorter especially because its going to be used in the national elections in 2010 the faster the count the better for everyone
3258141 its double the percentage that we said would be good its excellent
3258142 hopefully we will be able to proclaim before 5 p m tomorrow
3258143 our people down there are eager to proclaim there appear to be clear winners already
3258144 i dont want anything to mar this exercise because were trying to rush it
3258145 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3258146 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
3258147 if we play like we played this week we will beat australia but its going to take a lot to do it
3258148 this was a one off it was a very exciting stage a starting stage and the most important thing will be to turn up to every single test match like weve done this week
3258149 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3258150 ive done a lot of thinking over the last few days
3258151 you do find yourself thinking about the game more and scenarios
3258152 ive certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than when i would have when i was a player because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3258153 it will be important over the next nine months to learn their roles and then deliver
3258154 he said he would see but the travel has always been the problem for steve being away from his family
3258155 i respect the man for the decisions he makes and it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
3258156 weve seen this week how important hes going to be for us hes a huge player im going to be looking after steve as much as i can but also making sure i get the best out of him and i think i know the sort of ways to do it
3258157 whatever i say i dont want to take anything away from englands victory
3258158 i think they were motivated but i think they came out and played the better cricket in the game
3258159 i think the emotion that we felt after winning at edgbaston was always going to be difficult to re invent and bring into this game and i think that showed in the way we performed
3258160 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him and two years ago he was a very important player at charlton
3258161 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3258162 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3258163 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3258164 spain were the best team at the euros they won because they played with confidence
3258165 the other countries played with a lot of spirit and the level of their players was good but we are at the same level or better
3258166 we have to play with spirit and we have to play with confidence it is down to me to transmit it
3258167 i hope the community shield wont be the last trophy we win this season
3258168 weve worked hard in pre season and ive seen the hunger in the players eyes
3258169 we are ready to win more trophies because there exists a winning mentality at united
3258170 paul scholes gary neville and ryan giggs have been at the club for so many years but they are still so driven to win trophies
3258171 we saw in the community shield that they are ready to fight for every ball this pushes other players on
3258172 they set the example that the rest of us need to follow they are important players for us
3258173 we have a big squad everyone stayed over the summer and maybe the boss will look to bring in one more player
3258174 we have missed wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo during pre season but against portsmouth we saw that other players can fill their positions
3258175 chelsea are always the main rivals they have a great team with big players its easy for them to buy players
3258176 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3258177 when i told chief executive martin bain on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness
3258178 the rangers supporters have been fantastic to me but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back i want to thank them for everything
3258179 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3258180 the club has received a substantial uplift in fee and we will now reinvest in the team
3258181 there is no doubt about it carlos was rangers best player last season so to lose him is a shattering blow
3258182 if it is carlos decision then the fans must respect that but it seems to be one thing after another
3258183 but the money must be invested and invested quickly we would expect to see signings in the next few days and they must be the right signings or questions will be asked
3258184 the start of the season has been a disaster and this has made it worse
3258185 we have been knocked out of europe with the loss of all the money that incurs and now we have lost our best player
3258186 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3258187 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3258188 although i cannot comment on the individual decisions of the criminal injuries compensation authority i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3258189 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk
3258190 a quarrel in a faraway country between people of which we know nothing
3258191 if you have commented on gosmelltheflowers com earlier you will need to
3258192 i have an offer on the table are you interested in representing me
3258193 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3258194 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3258195 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3258196 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3258197 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3258198 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3258199 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3258200 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3258201 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3258202 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3258203 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3258204 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3258205 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3258206 i can neither confirm nor deny anything at least for now
3258207 it is remember the person that is going to hell
3258208 oh one moment i will let you speak to i am sorry i didnt recognize your voice
3258209 the time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to abrahams side
3258210 he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets
3258211 he bore to the left as if he was going into my bedroom and i said hey
3258212 and i went over to him and put my hands on his shoulders and said i think you have to leave
3258213 basically he said i am a black man in oakland and they are going to shoot me you gotta help me can i climb out through the window and i said no
3258214 the only way you can go out is through the front door with your hands up
3258215 i really wasnt too much scared of him he didnt seem like a threat too much i just didnt want the police coming in to the apartment with their guns trigger happy and stuff
3258216 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3258217 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3258218 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature
3258219 it is quite a complex matter and cant just make a judgement on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence
3258220 however it is an evolving situation and we will look at it
3258221 dr thaksin will be making no statements in london while the judicial process remains active and he is not going to get involved in conversations about manchester city
3258222 what has happened to me and my family and my close relations has resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3258223 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3258224 will be integral to ensuring that our party creates a forward looking platform that is rooted in our core values and principles
3258225 economic policy including technology and innovation taxes trade economic development labor and related issues
3258226 a total of 56 200 manufacturing jobs were lost between january 1997 and november 2007 almost 25 0 percent of total manufacturing employment it now appears that the rate of job losses in this sector has moderated although further consolidation in the nondurables sector is likely

3258292 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3258293 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3258294 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3258295 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3258296 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3258297 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3258298 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
3258299 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
3258300 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
3258301 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things

3258348 thus creativity involves both a process and a result it springs out of our seeing possibilities we have not seen before seeing connections between patches of truth and beauty and responding to them in ways we have not done before feelings that lead to poetry mental imagery that leads to painting and pondering that gives birth to prose are but examples creativity therefore is not simply innovation but organization self discipline is required as part and parcel of that self discovery which is paralleled by the discovery of the universes vast and small of which we are a part gospel gladness can give us a precious perspective about all these things and can spur us on to share that beauty which our father in heaven helps us to create it is a process that should not trouble itself overmuch initially with questions of originality and utility but rather with quality and excellence
3258349 the recent push by the church for members to get into the blogging habit does provoke an interesting question perhaps rhetorical perhaps not with all the church asks its members to do and to be sure those most motivated to start blogs will be those most committed to the church in other areas are we increasing the risk of member and family level burnout as we cram more and more things to do during the course of the day
3258350 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3258351 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3258352 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3258353 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3258354 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3258355 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3258356 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3258357 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3258358 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3258359 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3258360 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3258361 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3258362 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3258363 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3258433 female sexuality is being abused by both sides in turkey conservative circles try to repress it by isolating women from society while the liberal circles use it by pushing them to dye their hair act in video clips or be models today you can even see marilyn monroes picture on bread bags
3258434 there are only a few duties placed on women and one of them is being a mother of course it is a very nice thing and humankind should reproduce but society ties your hands when it happens you have to step back from your working life and you become a person who does not have any personal time or interests
3258435 i put the scissors there to imply that if you want you can actually cut it these ties

3258776 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3258777 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased

3258855 i cant believe it people i just cant believe i can see again
3258856 my vision has been failing for more than two years everything was grey and now i can see beautiful colours again
3258857 i love reading but my vision started failing about five or six years ago when they took the bandages off i looked at my hand and saw my wedding rings so clearly it was the most wonderful thing i just wish my husband was alive to see me now
3258858 we chose the sight operations because at that time there was a backlog of more than 700 patients needing surgery the eye clinics were unable to cope with the number so we decided the lions would fund cataract operations
3258859 extra good now because ouma can see what theyre up to
3258860 we hope the extra funds raised will enable the sight first project to conduct more operations and bring back the miracle of sight to many more people
3258861 we have a target of making the average commuter return fare no higher than 10 of the national minimum wage that they would earn that day
3258862 we want to ensure that accredited licensed taxi operators will become shareholders in the company that will run the scheme there will need to be a change of mentality so that they adhere to fixed routes at fixed frequencies and will be paid a fixed amount irrespective of the number of passengers carried
3258863 saya tidak bisa membayangkan apa yang akan dikatakan oleh kaum muslimin jika mereka mendengar cerita cerita di abad pertengahan dan mengerti apa yang biasa dikatakan oleh ahli pidato kristen dalam hymne hymne mereka semua hymne kami bahkan hymne yang muncul sebelum abad ke 12 berasal dari konsep yang merupakan akibat dari perang salib hymne hymne itu dipenuhi oleh kebencian kepada kaum muslimin dikarenakan ketidakpedulian mereka terhadap agamanya akibat dari hymne dan nyanyian itu kebencian terhadap agama itu tertancap di benak mereka dan kekeliruan ide menjadi berakar yang beberapa diantaranya masih terbawa hingga saat ini tiap orang menganggap muslim sebagai orang musyrik tidak beriman pemuja berhala dan murtad
3258864 bukankah karena khilafah islam dan ulama yang menyebabkan para petani turki berperang hingga mati selama lima abad sudah waktunya turki mengurus urusannya sendiri dan mengabaikan orang india dan orang arab turki harus melepaskan dirinya untuk memimpin kaum muslimin
3258865 kita harus mengakhiri apapun yang akan membawa persatuan islam diantara anak anak kaum muslimin sebagaimana yang kita telah sukses laksanakan dalam mengakhiri khilafah maka kita harus memastikan bahwa tidak pernah ada lagi bangkitnya persatuan kaum muslimin apakah itu persatuan intelektual dan budaya
3258866 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3258867 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3258868 would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august the 6th
3258869 has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3258870 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3258871 one of the inspectors died of his wounds at the scene the other died in hospital
3258872 both vista and netscape show that large companies make huge blunders in technology in the case of microsoft they no longer count on moving users to new products as quickly as they want time warners short sighted decision to abandon netscape shows technology decisions are long term ones and companies that want to create value in that market need to look beyond quarter to quarter earnings but the real story is the continued erosion of microsofts market share

3258875 virtually all conventional pin tumbler locks are vulnerable to this method of attack and frankly nobody has really considered it or looked at it before
3258876 when you have a high security lock you dont expect this to be able to happen
3258877 key control is supposed to make this impossible to happen thats what youre paying for
3258878 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
3258879 youre an employee and you loan it to somebody or your kid takes it off your key ring and makes a copy and tells his friends to break into the facility i can give you a lot of scenarios
3258880 if youre a security manager for the federal reserve or citibank you have a belief that what the company is telling you is true that unless its authorized nobody can reproduce your keys
3258881 so if you give a key to an employee you dont have to worry about it and thats the problem its not true
3258882 this attack you dont need to know what youre doing
3258883 basically if someone came to me before and said they could pick a medeco lock id say youre crazy you dont know what youre talking about if they told me they could open it with plastic the same thing id say youre crazy
3258884 locksmiths dont have a clue what is going on your locksmith will tell you this is impossible

3258897 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3258898 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3258899 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages

3258904 i dont think that im unfairly going on the record to recognize that the mbta like most public transportation systems faces real cash issues

3258910 for google literally everything that happens on the internet is a complement to its main business the more things that people and companies do online the more ads they see and the more money google makes because the sales of complementary products rise in tandem a company has a strong strategic interest in reducing the cost and expanding the availability of the complements to its core product its not too much of an exaggeration to say that a company would like all complements to be given away to borrow a well worn phrase google wants information to be free and that is why google strikes fear into so many different kinds of companies
3258911 data has this really weird quality in economic terms data has an increasing marginal utility anyone who took econ 101 knows that most physical objects have a decreasing marginal utility data has the opposite characteristic each incremental point of data adds value to the ones you all ready have googles services all benefit from additional data albeit in different ways google could potentially provide a better value proposition to the end user with an inferior algorithm powered by more data sourced from a broader range of services
3258912 all this sort of web 2 0 stuff is nice but you have to type stuff in things are never up to date and unless you consciously know about something you cant put it in reality mining is all about paying attention to patterns in life and using that information to help you do things like set privacy policies share things with people notify people when youre near them and just to help you live your life
3258913 a research team has developed a bci system that lets the user walk an avatar through the streets of second life while relying solely on the power of thought the system consists of a headpiece equipped with electrodes that monitor activity in three areas of the motor cortex the region of the brain involved in controlling the movement of the arms and legs an eeg machine reads and graphs the data and relays it to the bci where a brain wave analysis algorithm interprets the users imagined movements a keyboard emulator then converts this data into a signal and relays it to second life causing the on screen avatar to move in this way the user can exercise real time control over the avatar in the 3d virtual world without moving a muscle

3258949 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3258950 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults

3259106 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3259107 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity

3259109 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaeda we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3259110 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3259111 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3259112 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope

3259145 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3259146 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3259147 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3259148 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
3259149 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
3259150 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything
3259151 it is so clear what is happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war
3259152 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3259153 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3259154 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3259155 all the russian troops who arrived by ship have crossed over to zugdidi
3259156 the city is deserted but there are no russians here
3259157 its not south ossetia only but the whole of georgia
3259158 we heard statements saying that the russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission now we know the truth these forces were there to aid a russian invasion
3259159 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end

3259162 a cup run is vitally important for this football club
3259163 ive had fairly decent success in this competition over the last few years and i want to continue that with qpr
3259164 we werent at our best on saturday and there is a lot of room for improvement
3259165 defensively we werent as good as i know we can be and ill be looking for an improvement on tuesday
3259166 a good cup run is very important to me and well be heading to swindon with a very strong squad make no mistake
3259167 theyve brought a couple of new faces in and it certainly wont be easy for us at their place
3259168 its important that we really impose ourselves on the match from the opening whistle i want to see us get the ball down and pass it and be creative like we were against barnsley at the weekend
3259169 the county ground isnt an easy place to go but we head there in good spirits after our win on saturday
3259170 the early rounds come quite thick and fast in this competition and if things go your way before you know it you come up against one of the big boys
3259171 well take each game as it comes though and that starts with swindon town at the county ground
3259172 that will always be my outlook going into any cup competitions
3259173 if you look at the big picture then it is a fantastic opportunity to generate revenue and that is a part of my job the easiest way to do that is to have a good run although its a long shot we will give the carling cup everything we can
3259174 jerel ifil wont play tomorrow night he picked up a knock on saturday and will miss out chris allen and kevin amankwaah have been added to the squad as we can name seven substitutes for the game so that will give us a few more options
3259175 sean morrison will play tomorrow night patrick kanyuka hasnt trained enough to be involved it would be wrong to throw him in
3259176 we have organised a reserve game against southampton on wednesday at their training ground and the likes of patrick and eastie will feature in that
3259177 the costs for setting up an ira with checkbook control can be considerably more than a standard ira but the ira holder doesnt pay additional transactional special asset based or holding fees

3259182 exit strategy was initially to sell the house and it didnt work because the buyer didnt get financing approval
3259183 if i choose to foreclose i could but im personally willing to work with the borrowers
3259184 you cannot take any kind of fee from your ira for doing something inside your ira and if you have to start using money from other sources to bail out something happening with the loan inside the ira thats a big problem

3259195 it burned down and the insurance company denied my claim
3259196 they would finance the construction i would do the construction and follow the project all the way through and then we would split the profits 50 50 in the end
3259197 at the end of the day if that property does not sell youre not paying a mortgage on the property
3259198 people have properties out there that theyve been holding on to for two years
3259199 i know how to negotiate the subcontractors down to where i would actually feel comfortable paying them
3259200 in my twenties i had time to have ups and downs
3259201 once i hit 30 and beyond if you make a mistake it hurts you

3259205 entity investments in your ira advantages cautions and legal considerations
3259206 the assumptions about returns inflation longevity and expenses were highly simplistic
3259207 i would say that chapter 11 has become somewhat of a more accepted strategic tool than just companies filing who are about to go out of business or something like that as a result theres more use of chapter 11 now than probably 20 years ago
3259208 the richest people are getting richer and the middle class workers are falling further behind
3259209 what is the meaning of retirement if the only way you can live is to work the answer is there is no meaning to retirement anymore we are now shifting from lifetime pensions to lifetime work its the end of retirement
3259210 how to invest in offshore real estate and pay little or no taxes
3259211 it is a powerful tool that most people dont know about but should there are at least four distinct advantages over an ira individual retirement account
3259212 conventional thinking would probably view this as very risky for someone of my age
3259213 there are many safer investments which i could have chosen
3259214 i dont know of anybody who ever realized a dream by allowing their fears to prevent them from giving it their best shot regardless of the outcome i will never regret going for my dream if i hadnt tried i would have always wondered what might have been
3259215 investors couldnt justify leaving the stock market because it was performing too well

3259254 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3259255 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3259256 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3259257 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3259258 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3259259 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3259260 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3259261 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3259262 the mother was there he was still there but they left
3259263 he wasnt that close to them so he just said they left
3259264 he was aspiring to be an actor out there and he thought it a more appropriate name
3259265 but theres nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use them to defraud
3259266 to our mind the efforts undertaken by this defendant to avoid conclusive identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value
3259267 any identification we make must be checked double checked supported and verified by every means possible

3259269 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3259274 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3259275 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3259276 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3259277 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3259278 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3259279 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3259280 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3259281 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3259282 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3259283 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3259284 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3259285 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3259286 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3259287 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3259288 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3259289 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3259290 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3259291 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3259292 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
3259293 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at
3259294 we really need to win thank god everything came through my way
3259295 guy throwing hard threw me a good pitch it sunk
3259296 were many years away in some instances from having answers to specific questions
3259297 theyre not prepared to look at the information and evidence as it rolls forward and then make up their mind
3259298 given that they start from that premise they then make some very wild and unsubstantiated claims as if they are fact
3259299 we dont want qer controlling all of the information processes we just want answers to questions
3259300 basically what were doing is ensuring the community gets its information
3259301 personally i know a lot of councillors have got grave concerns over it but as community leaders we just make sure the proper information gets out so we can make a proper logical assessment of it
3259302 i too share a lot of concerns the community have
3259303 the mining doesnt worry me but at the end of the day its got to be done in a particular way that is good for the environment
3259304 if this was out in the west somewhere not in a high rainfall area near wetlands im sure it wouldnt create as much attention as it getting now
3259305 certainly where it is theyve got a lot of hurdles to jump over
3259306 i gave it my all and there was nothing left in the tank
3259307 its cool for me as this is my first major international final and i came fourth in the olympics
3259308 it motivates me to go back to arizona train harder on my start and turns and then i can come back next time and grab a medal
3259309 i just watched vanderkay and tried to stay with him so that maybe in the last 50m i could pass him but he had a little bit more
3259310 i know sebastein rousseau and jasper venter have improved a lot since trials ill be fast and darian townsend is swimming awesome so we have a good shot at making the finals
3259311 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3259312 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3259313 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3259314 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3259315 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3259316 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding

3259325 americans should be asking a simple question why 435 there is absolutely nothing magic or sacrosanct about 435 and yet the public and the media seem to have grown so accustomed to a 435 member house that we accept it as the natural order of things almost as if it was mandated by the constitution
3259326 in determining questions in the united states in congress assembled each state shall have one vote
3259327 in the end both sets of forces preferred compromise to the breakup of the union and the plan was accepted
3259328 all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
3259329 the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one representative
3259330 the actual enumeration shall be made within 3 years after the first meeting of the congress and within every subsequent term of ten years
3259331 the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state for six years and that each senator shall have one vote
3259332 the house did by statute what should arguably require a constitutional amendment
3259333 its like a starter home for a young couple once the kids arrive its time to get a bigger house in the past 90 years the american family has added lots and lots of kids

3259339 estou bem para as outras provas inclusive vou nadar os 200 m peito como mais uma chance de competir em uma prova em que estou treinando muito bem embora n o seja a minha principal

3259341 transaction processing applications are characterized by high volumes of traffic
3259342 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3259343 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3259344 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3259345 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3259346 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3259347 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3259348 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3259349 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3259350 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3259351 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3259352 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3259353 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3259354 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3259355 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3259356 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3259357 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3259358 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3259359 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3259360 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3259361 australia merupakan pengeluar utama bagi hasil ternakan kambing biri biri dan lembu di dunia
3259362 berdasarkan kelebihan itu kementerian berharap jalinan kerjasama antara dua negara ini mampu membantu malaysia membangunkan industri ternakan tersebut melalui kaedah baru seperti bioteknologi ujarnya
3259363 saya amat bersetuju dengan matlamat kerajaan yang mahu menjadikan pertanian suatu perniagaan kerana bidang ini amat menguntungkan selain membantu negara tidak bergantung kepada sayuran import
3259364 saya kemudian menceburi bidang penternakan udang tetapi tidak berhasil kerana amat sukar dijaga selain makanannya amat mahal
3259365 bayangkan harga timun dari ladang kini rm1 40 sekilo manakala terung mencecah rm2 20 sekilo dan setiap hari pasti ada permintaan kita perlu tekun dan berusaha kerana allah yang menyediakan rezeki
3259366 saya menggunakan kaedah fertigasi bagi menanam tembikai dan sayur sayuran berkenaan
3259367 namun penanaman sayur sayuran ini hanya dilakukan secara sampingan ketika waktu rehat sebelum menanam semula tembikai
3259368 mereka membuang medium berkenaan kerana mengikut nasihat jabatan pertanian medium berkenaan tidak lagi baik digunakan selepas dua atau tiga kali penanaman tembikai rock melon dilakukan
3259369 jadi saya hanya perlu pergi mengambil sisa medium berkenaan daripada mereka
3259370 sisa medium berkenaan hanya perlu diperiksa tahap asid dan jika tahap itu tinggi saya akan mencampur sedikit kapur bagi mengurangkannya sebelum digunakan
3259371 pada saya medium sabut kelapa berkenaan yang berwarna keperangan boleh digunakan sehingga ia bertukar warna hitam
3259372 pendapatan saya meningkat kira kira 30 peratus daripada pendapatan bulanan selepas memulakan penanaman sayur sayuran ini
3259373 keuntungan yang saya dapat tidaklah terlalu tinggi kerana peningkatan harga baja benih dan polibeg sejak kenaikan harga minyak baru baru ini
3259374 ia berbeza dengan penanaman di atas tanah dan menggunakan kaedah fertigasi kerana kita dapat mengawal penyaluran air dan baja kedua dua faktor tersebut menentukan kualiti hasil yang akan kita perolehi

3259377 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3259378 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3259379 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3259380 let it be a u n mandated international force ideally eu
3259381 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3259382 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion

3259385 they are also not as attached to e mail as their primary form of technology based communication theyre much more into text messaging and instant messaging so how you reach these voters is an important question going forward

3259387 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats
3259388 completed a significant part of the operations to oblige georgia the georgian authorities to restore peace to south ossetia
3259389 we left behind all the equipment in the hospital and 80 bodies in the morgue
3259390 if tbilisi comes under threat i will inform the residents 12 hours in advance
3259391 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3259392 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3259393 to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3259394 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3259395 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3259396 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3259397 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3259398 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3259399 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3259400 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3259401 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3259402 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3259403 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3259404 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3259405 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3259406 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3259407 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3259408 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3259409 as we all know hamas is not only working in gaza
3259410 it works in the west bank too therefore i cannot act as if nothing has happened
3259411 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it
3259412 it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time
3259413 i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3259414 im just thinking about my next start and helping this team win as many games as we can
3259415 we got the hits when we needed them and got the win so im happy with that
3259416 it depends on what the meaning of the word is is
3259417 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3259418 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
3259419 it s just a needle stick but the cascade of events that follows are fairly serious
3259420 i think the burden is on medicine to try and generate some evidence that the net benefits are there before drawing that tube of blood
3259421 its going to mean going back and examining these other things and making sure there arent holes especially in terms of food safety
3259422 the assumption is that for the extra money that you pay for most whole foods products in return youre getting something thats safer fresher and more nutritious
3259423 they already have a lot more inspection than most retailers would have
3259424 part of this is this is another example of a broken federal system that hasnt put enough resources into stopping this problem

3259446 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3259447 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3259448 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3259449 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3259450 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3259460 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3259461 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3259462 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3259463 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3259464 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him
3259465 i can pretty confidently say that no other quarterback in the league has ever stepped into a situation that hes stepped into
3259466 but hes handled it tremendously he played extremely well tonight and you could tell the organization you can tell why they have confidence in him
3259467 once we got going we were sharp we were crisp we moved the ball effectively and got a couple of touchdowns
3259468 it was just good to just get that first game rust off and get some confidence on those last couple of drives and get ready for the next one
3259469 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3259470 im going to go out and have some fun like i always do every year

3259565 theres a real problem that the bigger retailers will be able to spread the risk but at this point independent retailers could be at a disadvantage and it could deliver even less competition over the longer term
3259566 since petrol prices are driven mainly by global oil prices which will keep trending upwards as we hit peak oil fuelwatch is at best a political distraction from the main game of helping australians reduce our reliance on petrol driven cars
3259567 the greens are yet to be convinced that the scheme wont actually increase prices and we are waiting for the senate inquiry report with great interest we will be negotiating hard to make sure the government puts some real effort into the systematic roll out of fast efficient mass transit electric vehicles and second generation biofuels as well as alternatives such as cycleways walking paths and car pooling

3259615 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3259616 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3259617 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3259618 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3259619 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3259620 we have reports that six people were killed it was near badaber
3259621 about 18 paf pakistan air force employees were traveling to the base when the bomb planted on the bridge went off
3259622 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3259623 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3259624 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3259625 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
3259626 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
3259627 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3259628 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction

3259630 all he was trying to do was get some information to determine whether or not this needed to go to the rules committee
3259631 i think one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3259632 i thought it sounded very un democratic and i was completely shocked
3259633 a very clear message keep quiet if you want to come to the convention
3259634 as far as were concerned anytime theres a complaint filed we have to look into it
3259635 fifteen to 17 years old is not exactly the best age in life to be entrusted with power and authority
3259636 this age bracket is comprised of teenagers who are only beginning to learn what responsibility means
3259637 and should set aside their political activities for a while
3259638 disempower the people particularly the youth at the local level and contradict the essence of the devolution of the government
3259639 deepening democracy in the way we organize our politics entails having accessible local government units in this case the countrys youth having direct and meaningful participation in the affairs of government must be one of the solutions to its problems
3259640 it must be empowered to give the body oversight powers to make sk officials accountable to their constituency in terms of clear processes in development planning budgeting and disbursement of funds
3259641 this situation occurs at a time when preparations for legislative elections in november are under way and progress is being made to engage the international community to help meet the countrys priority peace building goals including its fight against drug trafficking
3259642 the secretary general calls on all national stakeholders to work cooperatively and peacefully together in the national interest and in full respect of the rule of law
3259643 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks
3259644 he walks through the whole barracks and gets to the end of the barracks and theres john malkovich and joe pantoliano and me its a six minute shot and then i screwed up my line
3259645 i said oh whoops sorry maybe we should cut steven spielberg is in another building watching on the monitors and i just hear silence then i hear him what happened
3259646 im like i just yelled cut because i screwed up and hes yelling no no you never cut

3259704 i contacted reporter tony pipitone the man mentioned in the video as the reporter who uncovered this he tells me that hes never done a report on benny hinn doing drugs he has done reports on hinn but did not have time to research if he might have actually used this video footage in a report i think he would be able to remember if this was in fact hinn passing around dope
3259705 so the video is highlysuspect he could not confirm he ever shot this video he said he would have to research if he wanted to confirm but does not have time to do so basically hesnot standing by it at this point nobody can confirm this im no fan of hinn at all and feel he is a terrible heretic but this video will remain suspect in my eyes till there is more solid confirmation

3259715 despite questions about their origin the lost ogle serves up the wittiest most inventive and cutting edge commentary about the sooner state available today

3259719 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that
3259720 i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums
3259721 the next one will bring it back to the start in a way
3259722 it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought
3259723 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world
3259724 i still cant believe they chose me to take on the role of lara and i cant wait to get stuck in this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts it is slightly daunting but i am really excited at the same time
3259725 you know you go through times where you feel it might not happen but you never ever give up hope
3259726 you dont ever use the words never happen its not healthy
3259727 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3259728 oh and just so you know im wearing one of those anachronistic union suits for no reason that anyone can fathom and its unbuttoned in the back obviously so youre pretty much guaranteed to see my ass
3259729 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
3259730 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned

3259733 we have been taught that even if we screw up in life to hide it
3259734 despite the benefits demonstrated for managing cardiovascular risks gaps remain in primary care practitioners management of risks according to guideline recommendations
3259735 patients should talk to their physicians about setting goals together for reducing blood pressure and cholesterol and making a plan to achieve the goals
3259736 are needed to address barriers and target specific groups of physicians to facilitate implementation of guideline based recommendations for cardiovascular management
3259737 most primary care physicians are concerned about cardiovascular risk in their patients and set goals for their patients to reduce this risk
3259738 physicians are concerned that their patients do not follow their advice about changes in exercise and diet and that they do not always take the medicine that is prescribed
3259739 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3259740 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i do not want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3259741 it gives me a mental lift to have got this far because to be honest if they had told me the bleakest medical diagnosis which came out in dribs and drabs in the end i might have said this is not going to happen
3259742 and there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up and gary lough her husband and coach said to me someone is testing you to see how much you want it
3259743 but regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i have tested it and pushed it a bit further because youre taking a gamble
3259744 you have to ask yourself are you prepared for the worst thing that can happen and for me the worst thing is not to be able to finish the race and i have already faced that in athens there have been points when i really did not think i would make it so i will the happiest of all the runners on the start line the key is being in there fighting
3259745 a cynical exercise in regulatory gaming that is so blatant that it demands that the government finally step in
3259746 an urgent meeting with the minister to discuss the need for immediate legislative action by the government to end ongoing manipulation of the regulatory regime by telstra
3259747 we can only speculate as to why it is happening but he is of tibetan descent and broadcasts in the tibetan language

3259749 we had played pretty well and argentina had been very good at their penalty corners
3259750 the establishment of the nssf is a key development in the royal governments work to protect workers in the private sector a duty which has until now fallen on the private sector
3259751 costs for the nssf depend on the companys salary levels but they will not be deducted from employees wages
3259752 the nssf will offer long term payments to the families of injured workers for example if a worker loses a leg at work we must support him indefinitely
3259753 if someone sustains a lethal injury his family members such as his wife or children must all be supported by the nssf the wife is insured until she gets married again while the children receive support until the age of 21
3259754 we welcome the establishment of the nssf as our workers have never received any appropriate compensation
3259755 furthermore we propose employers and unions can exercise the right to examine the nssf directors performance we want the ministry of labor to be transparent work because a public administrative institution has newly been founded as part of an effort for workers most of whom are weak and suffer much injustice from their employers

3259759 todays cfls underscore mercurys volatile vapor form which is still a significant health concern ventilation reduces but does not eliminate this toxicant mercury vapor inhalation can cause significant neural damage in developing fetuses and children
3259760 with short excursions over 25 000 ng m3 sometimes over 50 000 ng m3 and possibly over 100 000 ng m3 from the breakage of a single compact fluorescent lamp
3259761 in a glass jar with a metal lid or in a sealed plastic bag
3259762 of the 12 different types of containers tested during the 23 different tests the plastic bag was found to be the worst choice for containing mercury emissions
3259763 based upon this study the dep now suggests that a glass container with metal screw lid with a gum seal be used to contain debris
3259764 all three flooring surfaces in this study pre finished hardwood short nap carpet and shag carpet were able to be cleaned up with pre study cleanup guidance so that they looked clean however mercury vapors emanating from all three surface types were detected especially when agitated for weeks after the cleanup of a break flooring surfaces once visibly clean can emit mercury immediately at the source that can be greater than 50 000 ng m3
3259765 flooring surfaces that still contain mercury sources emit more mercury when agitated than when not agitated this mercury source in the carpeting has particular significance for children rolling around on a floor babies crawling or non mobile infants placed on the floor
3259766 there are a number of studies documenting neurotoxicity as a consequence of inhalation of elemental mercury in adults studies documented changes in eeg deficits in peripheral nerve function autonomic effects psychological and sleep changes and deficits in fine motor performance visuomotor coordination visual reaction time visual scanning memory concentration and executive function
3259767 it is well established that the developing organism may be much more sensitive than the adult to neurotoxic agents for example methylmercury exposure can produce devastating effects in the fetus including
3259768 infants and toddlers also have a much higher rate of respiration than adults therefore they have a higher exposure to similar concentrations they also are lower to the floor and therefore closer to the source of the exposure and presumably more apt to obtain a concentrated dose of mercury
3259769 he wants to use this to advance his agenda for cartel criminalisation

3259774 european online hiring activity remained mostly steady in july as weaker demand in scandinavia benelux and the uk was offset by sustained growth in germany and italy
3259775 employers are definitely hiring at a slower pace than they were a year ago

3259781 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3259782 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3259783 i dont think its a foolish one at all i think in fact its being realistic
3259784 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3259785 every time russia the soviet union in the past attacked somebody they have always claimed that they responded you know they were
3259786 we are going to moscow to see if on the other side they will be able to agree on this document we have some hope but of course it is always the same thing peace missions take time
3259787 theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia these actions would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that their objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august 6 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbour state and threatens a democratic government elected by the people such action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3259788 the cold war has been over for a long time but this cold war mentality dominates the thinking of some american diplomats it is a pity but we continue building up relations with all partners and of course our american partners
