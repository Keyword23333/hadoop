4570000 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4570001 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
4570002 we kind of laid it out that way at the beginning of the year to hopefully be involved in having a chance to get in the chase at this point in the year
4570003 we tried to make sure were as fresh as we could be going into the chase and that was what we felt was the best thing to do im happy cale gales going to get an opportunity this week and glad i dont have to do it
4570004 you just race as hard as you can it wouldnt be anything that we do any differently if we were first and it wouldnt be different if we were 20th we race as hard as we can and where it falls is where it falls theres not a whole lot we can do in between
4570005 whats wrong with a couple of currently serving united states senators going to georgia and assessing things
4570006 well to begin with they went at the behest of mccain
4570007 america has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world
4570008 is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas were taxing them out of the country
4570009 the biggest environmental issue almost no one in new york is paying attention to
4570010 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network
4570011 a network that provides superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings with great content

4570014 ive been hearing things about me on your website we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4570015 i heard that jay sorta said something about me at the wimbledon tennis match
4570016 i didnt see him say it i didnt hear no audio so i dont really know if he was dissing me if he said something about me
4570017 hes witty hes clever his metaphors will be sitting right next to you and then hit you in the face so hard that you dont know what happened thats the type of rapper jay is i was molded by that part of him and added that to my own persona and my own marksmanship as an emcee
4570018 jay z s a legend man i respect his music but that doesnt really mean i have to respect him if hes disrespecting me
4570019 hint money flows into most funds after good performance and goes out when bad performance follows
4570020 the key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and above all the durability of that advantage
4570021 if you knew what was going to happen in the economy you still wouldnt necessarily know what was going to happen in the stock market
4570022 it is a truth very certain that when it is not in our power to determine what is true we ought to follow what is most probable

4570027 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4570028 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4570029 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future
4570030 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4570031 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4570032 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4570033 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
4570034 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4570035 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
4570036 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington dc but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4570037 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4570038 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4570039 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4570040 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation will enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4570041 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4570042 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
4570043 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4570044 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life
4570045 all childhood memories are unreliable we construct narratives to justify what we now think
4570046 can you produce one economist to support the gas tax holiday
4570047 that doesnt matter because you can just look it up on the internet
4570048 the four most dangerous words in investing are its different this time
4570049 what if your advisor talks only about returns not risk its his job to take risk into account by telling you the range of possible outcomes you face if he wont go to a new planner someone who will get real
4570050 the fact that equities are being sold down despite the lowest interest rates in recent history simply means that the market doesnt see growth ahead for very many businesses
4570051 dont limit investing to the financial world invest something of yourself and you will be richly rewarded

4570055 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration
4570056 as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4570057 discovery of these wrecks would offer unprecedented information on the exploration of canadas north and the discovery of the northwest passage a critical piece of our shared history and important to present and future generations

4570064 i dont understand when people are going around worrying about we need to have english only they want to pass a law we just we want english only now i agree that immigrants should learn english i agree with this but understand this instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english theyll learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
4570065 its embarrassing when europeans come over here they all speak english they speak french they speak german and then we go over to europe and all we can say is merci beaucoup
4570066 dishonest a danger to your liberty can be harmful if implemented to your way of life
4570067 terrorists have carried out this attack in coordination and consultation with some of the active intelligence circles in the region
4570068 extremists continue to show their disregard for all human life and their willingness to kill fellow muslims as well as others the united states stands with the people of afghanistan and india as we face this common enemy
4570069 the plett family who had been living in austria after being chased out of germany by the youth welfare authorities who had taken custody of their children have now left austria and have fled to canada where they hope to be able to freely home school their children without further interference from german authorities
4570070 in fact not too long ago one family actually decided to flee germany to iran to home school their children if you can believe a family fleeing germany to iran for freedom
4570071 loving your country shouldnt just mean fireworks on the 4th of july loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it if you do your life will be richer our country will be stronger
4570072 we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
4570073 once i was looking at a nice bmw x 5 going for only 5 000 a great price he said but then i saw that there were two bullet holes and blood on the seats i mean you know what you d have to spend just to clean the upholstery

4570081 you know what that group is called its called everyone

4570083 forgive my staring you look just like my sister in law
4570084 yes and blond and chearleader bubbly not to say that you are like a chearleader or anything i dont really know you
4570085 thats so funny just yesterday my friend and i were walking down the street in the lower east side and this big thug moving guy said hey you two must be from out of town youre smiling
4570086 im a native new yorker and we smile all the time
4570087 were seeing a big increase in first time buyers especially with scooters
4570088 were also seeing people get back into the sport who previously havent ridden for a while
4570089 this year they are up they are up everywhere not just locally
4570090 the general public has to be aware there are more motorcycles out there
4570091 they need to look when they pull out from a stop sign and stay aware
4570092 most of these wrecks are caused by the motorcycle riders
4570093 im excited that theyre full weve been trying to get people into these classes
4570094 its important to match the motorcycle with the experience of the rider
4570095 you dont want to put a 16 or 17 year old inexperienced rider on a 1 000 cc high performance motorcycle were really cautious when somebody comes in to buy a motorcycle for the first time we dont want to put that person on a high performance motorcycle
4570096 i was so proud of her for riding within her limits when she wasnt comfortable she didnt push it you need to respect your abilities and respect the machine youre riding
4570097 i believe a helmet could have made a tremendous impact on the outcome
4570098 i cant imagine why people dont wear helmets if they had seen what i have seen in my career they would wear their helmets
4570099 it could make all the difference i would urge everybody to wear their helmets its like wearing your seatbelt when youre in a car
4570100 i personally highly recommend a safety helmet jacket and gloves
4570101 thats a lot of people i certainly dont see that as acceptable
4570102 the public has to accept responsibility for their actions while theyre driving a vehicle
4570103 somebody just made a mistake somebody drifted left of center and somebody died somebody rolled through a stop sign and somebody was killed
4570104 but the fact is we may have just saved your life
4570105 your chances of dying in a motor vehicle accident in knox or morrow county are high

4570109 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4570110 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4570111 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4570112 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4570113 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4570114 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
4570115 we could just start the disposal with running water as we dump them in and you wont even notice how bad they smell
4570116 kids did predict when and where their bottles would be found which was kind of fun
4570117 i think most people predicted they would be found within a year
4570118 we are second graders at sunset elementary we cant wait to hear from you
4570119 i was out of town in california and i got a call from my mom and she was like do you remember writing a letter in a bottle in second grade and i absolutely didnt remember anything at all
4570120 at first it was kinda hazy but then i did remember in second grade we were writing some bottle letters
4570121 if you find this please write back to us right away
4570122 as quick as we found it we got back it only took 10 years and five months but we got back to em

4570131 the actions of russia in recent days have damaged its credibility in the eyes of the free world bullying and intimidation are not the way to conduct foreign policy
4570132 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4570133 got a lot of folks smart folks analyzing the situation on the ground and of course briefing us on different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4570134 timed to directly interfere with the impact of a political message
4570135 we are excited to be a part of the 1st annual chess kings invitational
4570136 the hhcf has used the connection between hip hop and chess to make the game not only accessible but cool to a new whole audience the chessmaster series of video games does the same thing inviting people of all ages and skill levels to engage in the timeless art of chess it was a natural connection for us to become partners in bringing this great event to the community
4570137 we are amazed by how well we have been received since our first event earlier this year
4570138 by celebrities donating their time it really sends a message that they care about the state of our communities their presence will greatly assist us in raising money to provide scholarships to local schools
4570139 we are proud to host an event that showcases an authentic intelligent trend in hip hop
4570140 hip hop has always been about more than bullets and bling and the fact that so many fantastic rappers chessmasters martial artists and graf writers have donated their time to the children is proof of this in itself
4570141 were talking about a pretty small additional increase to get these animals out of these horrible crammed cages
4570142 and therefore a lot of people already know the value of the product
4570143 its the only bottle of water that you can carry with one finger
4570144 we looked at it with our store managers and also our executive management and everybody said wow how come we havent done this before
4570145 said bob mahlstede president of the catalina mart convenience chain which stocks fria in 12 of its 18 stores
4570146 i dont want to be known as a second half guy i want to be known as a full season guy
4570147 second half guys dont get a chance to get to the second half if they dont have a good first half
4570148 whats strange with what weve seen from garret the last couple of years is his second half surge
4570149 he had been so consistent from start to finish you never noticed huge upswings or downswings its a trend you have to look at but its tough to put a finger on any one thing
4570150 theres no correlation there it doesnt take a lot to get going but it doesnt necessarily mean that im going to be successful i can still get hits even when my swing is not there but to keep building momentum i need to play every day and have my at bats pile up
4570151 the basic problem is that the people who are acquiring these properties they dont understand or want to understand that tenants have rights in san francisco
4570152 you cant just go in and tell them to leave you cant shut off utilities you cant call the police you cant do any of that stuff
4570153 what we are seeing graphically at organ pipe was predictable this is what happens when you circumvent environmental laws
4570154 when you build an impediment across a stream it becomes a dam and providing some holes in a fence is a joke
4570155 whatever is in the path of the redirected water flow will be damaged whether thats vegetation and natural resources or manmade structures
4570156 its something that has been anticipated and unfortunately has apparently been ignored in the rush to build this wall
4570157 i would just like to have them come back and re evaluate the structure
4570158 they need to come up with a process to be able to remove the debris prior to reaching the fence or the alter the design of the fence to accommodate more flow
4570159 it would be like putting your finger on the end of the water hose
4570160 you are restricting the water flow that is what the fence is doing
4570161 the family considers cash to be jakes hero because without her we probably would not have had a body to bring home
4570162 as weeks went by we hoped hed walk back in one day like hed been on vacation or something
4570163 having cash now is like having him with us it is the silver lining
4570164 cash had to have found a water source somewhere the morning dew off of the grass or maybe she found a puddle somewhere
4570165 she might have even resorted to eating small rodents for water
4570166 it sounds like such a strong bond that this dog will kill or die so to speak for this owner
4570167 dogs are extremely loyal to humans i dont think there is any other creature on the planet that is as loyal
4570168 jake was trying to be brave for everyone and not show he had been losing his ground
4570169 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
4570170 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home prescription drugs are the drug of choice for teens who are trying drugs for the first time they are getting drugs from their parents or their grandparents medicine cabinets
4570171 more and more they are coming in strung out on prescription pill opiates
4570172 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4570173 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4570174 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4570175 thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates web site who were not facebook members
4570176 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4570177 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4570178 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
4570179 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
4570180 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box

4570190 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4570191 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4570192 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4570193 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4570194 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4570195 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4570196 when i arrived here i didnt expect for sure to be in this final i arrived very tired
4570197 but when the week is coming i felt better and better im very happy to have this experience in my life
4570198 having beaten the best in the world and going for gold its an incredible scenario
4570199 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4570200 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals
4570201 we have a saying where i train last throw best throw
4570202 it wasnt the best throw of the day but it was my best throw so ill take it
4570203 had i gotten a better throw early i think i could have put it away and i felt like god dang i was so close
4570204 i feel like im gut shot right now the kid from poland he found a way to get it done he won it i didnt do my job none of the americans did their job
4570205 i know in eldon they had a big thing at the local community center i hope they enjoy it at least get a little bit of kick out of the last throw suspenseful this is all for them really
4570206 man i hope hes not all grown up by the time i get back
4570207 ive been here so long that i forgot what he looks like ive got a picture of him but im sure hes going to be a lot different by the time i get home
4570208 i was having some technical errors and pulling it down the left side
4570209 the more important thing is that christian cantwell won a silver medal i think he should be given a lot of praise for that because he certainly had a lot of stress and pressure on him over the last few years and hes an amazing athlete
4570210 dont hold anything back just spin as fast as you can break your fingers off and see where it lands and i almost broke my fingers off but luckily i got an inch longer than the second place guy so i walk away with a little bit of redemption from 2004

4570217 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly todays players love it
4570218 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
4570219 this is a bold decision and i think its a great one
4570220 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
4570221 as administrators it isnt our place to change things without adequate input for the past two years weve received feedback from all constituencies weve also been given a direction to make decisions that reward speed creativity and skill while maintaining the games safety and integrity by allowing shootouts the rules committee gave conferences a means to enhance game excitement we are always careful when making changes as there can be unintended consequences in this case the ccha council was comfortable that shootouts will have no direct impact on the rpi and also felt that shootouts are in the best interest of the game at this time
4570222 im excited about our league adopting it and its going to add a tremendous amount of excitement to the game fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so theyre going to love doing it in a game so its a win win situation when you look at it from that perspective
4570223 shootouts are going to be great for our fans they will keep people excited and in their seats right up until the last goal or save its going to be something that they will keep talking and raving about
4570224 a shootout may be conducted at the end of the five minute overtime period for advancement purposes in conference games or by mutual consent of both teams

4570297 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4570299 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4570300 we need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future
4570301 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4570302 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day

4570314 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4570315 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4570316 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4570317 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory

4570320 he mevedev confirmed that he was also going to sign the agreement and that russia would scrupulously respect its commitments to the accord notably the pullout of russian forces

4570335 we feel epa placed the public health and the environment at risk by not doing a number of required analyses before it issued the permit

4570378 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4570379 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4570380 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4570381 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4570382 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4570383 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4570384 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4570385 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4570386 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4570387 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4570388 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4570389 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4570390 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4570391 somehow we gamers who get so upset when people misrepresent our games on fox news or are stereotyped as a bunch of fat mouth breathers well guess what were about to acquire a much better stereotypes and thats a bunch of ignorant racist homophobes that have no tolerance or understanding about how other people live

4570394 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues

4570399 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4570400 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4570401 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4570402 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4570403 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4570414 though spiritual values are rightly imparted in our churches and synagogues universities are ideal venues for the examination of religion and faith from comparative and historical perspectives
4570415 it is a privilege for usc upstate to partner in the launch of this annual religion lecture series with a scholar and author of dr levines caliber
4570416 when dr levine was a child she was impressed by pope john xxiii she was fascinated by his fabulous hat his clean white clothing and his wonderful accessories who is that she asked her mother he is the pope and he is good for the jews amy jill levine decided that when she grew up she wanted to be the pope you cant her mother said youre not italian that began a life long quest to understand the relationship between jews and christians dr levine has learned much and she has much to teach us you will not want to miss this opportunity to learn together as a community

4570425 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
4570426 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers
4570427 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports

4570674 i want them to be interested in their own lives and their own accomplishments i dont want them to be interested in mine mine are of no consequence to them i am their mother thats all i want to be to them not some artist who discusses her work with them i dont care if they appreciate my artistry i just want them to appreciate my unconditional love my daughter is very interested in stories right now shes quite interested in fables she loves the tortoise and the hare all the basic ones she wants me to tell them to her over and over though she prefers the ending of the boy who cried wolf it has two different ones in which the boys mother rescues him at the last minute

4570687 ive been working all summer with them and a citizen group to figure out what to do we put together a set of drawings that maps out current conditions of the house and a proposal for the changes we plan to make

4570900 my feeling is it doesnt matter how many kids i have in the school i have the right to make sure that none of them come to school under fear of intimidation
4570901 the fact that we have gotten this far and the fact that we came so close to a victory should send a message to all school boards in the country that if you are banning things based on the fact that it is offensive that violates the constitution
4570902 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4570910 we have a large market in the payroll debit card space that we issue to companies of all sizes the concept of workers comp has a strong correlation to payroll

4570921 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4570922 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4570923 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4570924 customers never run out of their favorite reliv products plus they receive a discount on their orders distributors build a stronger customer base and garner new opportunities to increase sales and expand their organizations

4570926 on a year to date basis our pretax income was affected by the result of an 187 000 loss on marketable securities in 2008 versus 43 000 of net gains in 2007 or a net swing of 230 000 due to negative stock market conditions
4570927 in regard to our core business we have reversed the down trend of late 2007 and early 2008 and have now shown five consecutive months of sales increases including a record july 2008 we are excited about the customers that have been added and their potential to generate higher margins additionally we will continue to look for added efficiencies in our operation and cut costs wherever possible in order to enhance our profitability

4570930 sniper ammo is about 2 3 inches long a sniper round would have blown her hand off

4570941 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4570942 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4570943 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4570944 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4570945 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4570946 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4570947 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4570948 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4570949 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside

4570951 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4570952 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4570953 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4570954 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4570955 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4570956 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold

4570989 they went to board their aircraft which was being towed out of the hangar to go back to russia it had just had its undercarriage fixed they were breathalysed
4570990 you could see they werent right as they were waiting for the plane to be towed from the hangar they could not actually stand up on their own they were holding onto the side of the bus that had taken them to the hangar they were swaying thats why we got the police involved straight away

4571007 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4571008 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4571009 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4571010 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4571011 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4571012 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4571028 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4571029 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4571030 stifling political expression pressuring influential media and targeting vocal critics and opposition leaders
4571031 many people cant understand why the west failed to protect us
4571032 america was seen as an ally and georgian soldiers have been dying in iraq in the interests of global security but the west has shown that it doesnt care about russia invading other countries
4571033 all they did was express concerns while bombs were falling on us
4571034 in and around tskhinvali which are continuing combat activities including with the support of artillery and sniper fire
4571035 only the unconditional withdrawal of georgian troops can help to restore peace in the conflict zone
4571036 pushing china up a growth curve until it goes bust
4571037 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
4571038 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment
4571039 until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
4571040 it looked interesting relative to israel the money was excellent too
4571041 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
4571042 israel ziv and gal hirsch would come from time to time and watch us in action but we managed day to day operations ourselves
4571043 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
4571044 i got signed from dundee united to play right back but when the manager asked me to play left back when i first came in i said it was no problem and i felt quite comfortable there
4571045 i went a long period without playing there but the last few pre season games i played a few games at left back but its just the more games you play the more comfortable you get
4571046 i think its still up for grabs andreas came in at a time when i was injured and i was just coming back and the manager had no other options but to sign a right back
4571047 i feel now that the seasons started weve started afresh and its whoever has played better or performed better in training that catches the managers eye that is going to play
4571048 i think definitely its important for me to get out and play football
4571049 there are great fans here the coaching staff have been superb and everyone has made me welcome
4571050 at the end of the day to have european football on your cv something that you want so its definitely something i will look into
4571051 he gives us experience we dont have a lot of experience in the forward line he holds the ball up well runs the channels and his link up play is pretty decent as well
4571052 i got a bit of info on him and everyone said he was very hard but fair and i think that is all you can really ask for out of a manager
4571053 hes passionate he was like that as a player and hes got belief in me and that is somebody i want to work with
4571054 at the end of the day i want to score goals but i want to do well for myself which is important as a player
4571055 but i want to keep getting into the international sides and as soon as i heard that dundee united were interested it was a no brainer for me
4571056 the latest news we have is that he was in hiding in libya we dont know if hes still hiding if hes been detained or it hes managed to escape

4571072 what about restaurants that violate truth in menu laws by saying their dishes are organic when in fact they are only using organic produce when the vendor sends it to them by chance they say they offer cage free eggs but dont and organic coffee yet their brand is not certified patrons deserve to know that they are buying into a restaurant that has decided to jump on the green bandwagon without actually backing it up

4571085 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing

4571268 under the fuzzy international law of genocide the country might have a case if only because almost anyone in any conflict has a case

4571308 bonterra trust has been of the opinion that the trust structure is no longer capable of providing maximum value to unitholders
4571309 i think just about all the trusts are candidates for it its just a matter of when
4571310 one of the main advantages to being a trust was the ability to deduct the distributions made to the unitholders and thats what you give up going to the corporate model

4571323 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes that risk coming out is significant

4571357 bonterra trust s long term business strategy has been to combine its oil and gas production technical strengths with planned business strategies to generate above average results and returns for unitholders

4571359 i think just about all the trusts are candidates for it it s just a matter of when
4571360 one of the main advantages to being a trust was the ability to deduct the distributions made to the unitholders and that s what you give up going to the corporate model
4571361 trusts that have more tax pools available to them and don t need to rely as heavily on distributions to shelter tax they will be the ones that will be more inclined to convert sooner rather than later
4571362 there are some good buying opportunities out there right now but in some cases those opportunities would take them over the 20 per cent annual growth limit
4571363 they won t stick in the trust form because it s an unnecessarily complex and burdensome structure
4571364 so why not go back to the traditional model of a corporation but just carry on with the distributions

4571512 si queremos contar l neas de c digo no deber amos referirnos a ellas como l neas producidas sino como l neas consumidas
4571513 la programaci n puede ser divertida al igual que la criptograf a sin embargo ambas no deber an combinarse

4571531 la diferencia entre la teor a y la pr ctica es que en teor a no hay diferencia entre la teor a y la pr ctica
4571532 por norma los sistemas software no funcionan bien hasta que han sido utilizados y han fallado repetidamente en entornos reales
4571533 si el c digo y los comentarios no coinciden posiblemente ambos sean err neos
4571534 si no las capturas y procesas cerramos tu aplicaci n
4571535 cuando se est depurando el programador novato introduce c digo correctivo el experto elimina el c digo defectuoso
4571536 en un proyecto software con diez personas probablemente tres de ellas introducen tantos errores que podr amos considerar su productividad como negativa

4571574 the real inflation adjusted change in housing prices this year is more likely to be between zero per cent and minus five per cent for the country as a whole
4571575 while the probability of a u s esque 20 per cent plus decline in canadian house prices looks remote a five per cent to 10 per cent decline is certainly plausible and in fact more likely than it looked even a week ago with yesterdays release of july resale data showing major market prices down 3 6 per cent year over year from a near flat reading in june
4571576 not a surprise that we get some softness in housing prices in some areas of the country as there was some run up in housing prices but we did not have a housing bubble like the americans have had

4571622 vi vietato pure di avere rapporto con donne maritate eccetto quello schiave che la vostra mano destra possiede
4571623 le altre mogli del profeta hanno mostrato la loro gelosia facendo commenti sulle sue origini ebraiche
4571624 safiyah sii coraggiosa e indifferente loro non potranno mai essere superiori a te d loro io sono la donna del profeta harun la nipote del profeta musa e la moglie del profeta muhammad
4571625 safiyah tuo padre ha sempre mantenuto inimicizia con me sino a che allah ha preso la sua decisione
4571626 il profeta le ha dato la scelta di unirsi alla sua gente una volta liberi o acettare lislam e unirsi in matrimonio con lui
4571627 quando safiyah si sposata era molto giovane e secondo ci che stato riportato aveva non pi di diciassette anni ed era estremamente bella
4571628 hai detto una cosa che se fosse stata lasciata nel mare si sarebbe macchiata con esso sporcando lacqua
4571629 quindi safiyah si convinta della verit del profeta non ha risparmiata alcuna fatica nel prendersi cura di lui e provvedere con qualsiasi conforto potesse venirle in mente questo stato evidente sin da quando giunta al cospetto di muhammad dopo la caduta di khaibar
4571630 il profeta ha provato del risentimento nei suoi confronti quando si rifiutata di entrare in intimit con lui nel viaggio precedente

4571632 quando lapostolo di allah ha invaso khaibar abbiamo offerto la preghiera del fajr in quel luogo la mattina presto quando ancora era buio il profeta cavalcava e lo stesso abu talha io cavalcavo dietro abu talha il profeta ha passato la strada di khaibair velocemente e le mie ginocchia sfioravano le cosce del profeta lui ha scoperto la coscia e ho visto la bianchezza delle sue cosce quando siamo entrati nella citt lui ha detto allahu akbar khaibar rovinata ogni qualvolta ci avviciniamo ad una nazione ostile per combattere la malvagit sar il mattino di coloro che sono stati avvertiti
4571633 o profeta di allah dammi una schiava dei prigionieri catturati
4571634 o profeta di allah tu hai dato safiya bint huyai a dihya e lei la donna del capo della trib dei quraiza e an nadir quindi appartiene solo a te
4571635 o abu hamza quanto ha pagato il profeta come mahr per averla liberata e sposata
4571636 la sua persona stata il suo mahr in quanto lui lha liberata e sposata
4571637 mentre tornavamo um sulaim lha vestita per la cerimonia di nozze e durante la notte lha mandata come sposa al profeta

4571683 i got signed from dundee united to play right back but when the manager asked me to play left back when i first came in i said it was no problem and i felt quite comfortable there
4571684 i went a long period without playing there but the last few pre season games i played a few games at left back but its just the more games you play the more comfortable you get
4571685 i think its still up for grabs andreas came in at a time when i was injured and i was just coming back and the manager had no other options but to sign a right back
4571686 i feel now that the seasons started weve started afresh and its whoever has played better or performed better in training that catches the managers eye that is going to play

4571694 selen my father is well hes a man of very stable opinions you havent done anything wrong he just he just cant see past the differences between us to the big picture and he may never be able to do that
4571695 i do not think i understand how you are using this word
4571696 i mean hes pig headed stubborn he thinks that this ceremonial marriage is a bad idea and the fact that it is an important tradition for your people doesnt change that for him my point is selen you havent done anything he just dislikes the whole business and hes taking it out you on both of us

4571719 no the subject is your stupidity your bloody selfish stubbornness
4571720 yes that you you oaf how dare you do that to me you think i havent got anything better to do with my life than trot round after you sticking pieces back on
4571721 i think definitely its important for me to get out and play football
4571722 there are great fans here the coaching staff have been superb and everyone has made me welcome

4571724 he gives us experience we dont have a lot of experience in the forward line he holds the ball up well runs the channels and his link up play is pretty decent as well
4571725 i got a bit of info on him and everyone said he was very hard but fair and i think that is all you can really ask for out of a manager
4571726 hes passionate he was like that as a player and hes got belief in me and that is somebody i want to work with
4571727 at the end of the day i want to score goals but i want to do well for myself which is important as a player
4571728 but i want to keep getting into the international sides and as soon as i heard that dundee united were interested it was a no brainer for me
4571729 mccain did not mean to overlook every other international conflict over the past 20 years because he means business with russia and is protecting the democratic sovereign nation of georgia
4571730 consistently overoptimistic about the economic outlook over the past 12 months
4571731 that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
4571732 it hadnt come though until the past month and then it all came through in the past few weeks
4571733 literally every single group of seven economy is now headed towards a recessionary hard landing
4571734 the global economy not just the us into a serious and protracted recession
4571735 ignores significant differences in the relative importance of the factors driving the downturns in the respective regions
4571736 with oil at 145 a barrel the euro area is in recession with oil at 115 the region will stagnate for a while

4571770 he had a well developed palate for fine wines and the sorts of cheeses that would make a normal persons eyes water
4571771 the reign of charles ii was referred to as the restoration
4571772 his interest was piqued by the glimpse of the snake tattoo that writhed down her spine and disappeared head first into her low slung jeans
4571773 in a pique she threw the flowers on the floor at his feet and stamped on them
4571774 suspenseful and affecting a top notch thriller with a tender heart
4571775 5 stars a perfect read for the election year rob palmers book is superlative i was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time i cannot recommend this one highly enough magnificent
4571776 youre gonna want to read this one hold on for an intricately plotted wickedly smart trip through presidential politics just when you think youve got it figured out youll realize the games have just begun an excellent book
4571777 well you did seem rather well informed for a so called virgin to say nothing of imaginative
4571778 for gods sake sassenach i grew up on a farm its a verra straightforward business after all
4571779 and as for imagining things christ id spent months years imagining
4571780 im thinking that the water in the lochs that wee bit chilly but if it didna shrink my cock straight off the feel of the heat when i plunged into ye of course

4571784 i am not going into a freezing loch in order to gratify your perverted desires
4571785 no i was only thinking that when one has got a terrible headache it feels so wonderful when it stops
4571786 a type of wave in which the surface oscillates vertically between fixed nodes without any forward progression the crest at one moment becomes the trough at the next standing waves may be caused by the meeting of two similar wave groups that are travelling in opposing directions
4571787 what do you think of standing wave as a title for book seven
4571788 he spared a moment to look before touching off the next shot so far he had been firing with not the slightest thought for attitude or effect and forced himself not to blink as the gun went off with a jump like a live thing and the thunder that made you feel as though the ground shook though in fact it was your own flesh shaking
4571789 yes thats it its the echo of artillery fire felt in the flesh
4571790 has a lot of impact g but as doug noted sounds butcherous rather than substantial
4571791 is pretty evocative but sounds too much like a crime novel ok there aint much to the body in simple terms beyond flesh blood and bone a bit of to and fro with the prepositional phrases
4571792 for those interested in further discussion of the title and what it means or might mean g theres a conversation regarding it in the and for those who might have missed earlier news bulletins regarding 1

4571817 a terrific read the cold steel of high stakes politics meets the fiery secret of a presidents past in a blast of searing steam
4571818 clearly fundamentals are shifting in favor of the dollar global growth is slowing taking pressure off commodity prices export gains are lowering the u s trade deficit and theres now a better than 60 chance europe including the u k will have to cut interest rates
4571819 those are the best fundamentals for the dollar in about three years
4571820 should not conclude that buying the dollar or assets that benefit from a stronger dollar is a position without risk i e a slam dunk
4571821 theres little on the domestic economy side to make u s investors feel good and all it would take is another unexpected large write off for housing losses by a bank or a disruption in oil supplies somewhere in the world to start the negative sentiment stirring again and the dollars rise would end
4571822 barack obama is directly contrary to many positions and beliefs of martin luther king jr
4571823 obama is trying to make african americans believe he is the reality of the dream come true but hes not its a nightmare
4571824 senator obamas answer to the ills of society of higher government spending weaker national defense continued tax dollars to planned parenthood and support of gay marriage are diametrically opposed to everything african americans truly believe and an anathema to the dream of dr martin luther king jr
4571825 in the shadow of the famous i have a dream speech by my uncle in 1963 as barack obama makes his speech in 2008 how can the dream survive if we murder the children

4571884 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4571885 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4571886 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4571887 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4571888 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4571889 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4571890 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4571891 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4571892 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4571893 our hope has always been that each new endeavour will expose new audiences to rocky horror and expand its fan base so here we go again with a new cast believing that the remake will add to the phenomenon

4571902 considering that 41 percent of all trips in automobiles are two miles or less bikes are an ideal alternative
4571903 adebayor is not only promoting our country across the world with his performance for arsenal but by this act in this pressing time he has shown that he is a true son of togo
4571904 the flood disaster is becoming more complex and assuming alarming proportions
4571905 ade is talking to some international partnners and friends about more aid to be sent to the country
4571906 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4571907 i didnt find out about a lot of it until after he passed
4571908 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalized lack of empowerment to claim goods and services to which other population groups have greater access
4571909 why dont we show the same commitment and dedication in reconstruction as we did during the emergency phase
4571910 in april when it stops raining we go away and think the disaster is over
4571911 but there are 52 000 families out in the open the disaster hasnt finished for them their suffering is continuing
4571912 the initial solidarity we had during the emergency should be extended
4571913 humanitarian aid does not end when the rains end we have to guarantee the resettlement otherwise people will return to the flood prone areas and in january or february 2009 we will find ourselves rescuing the same people again
4571914 how do we ensure that this knowledge is truly transferred and does not just stay in the hands of a few artisans

4571917 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4571918 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4571919 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4571920 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4571921 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4571922 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4571923 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4571924 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4571925 both my parents have been a big influence on me

4571932 they looked like they were having a blast they are obviously in love
4571933 the other third trouble had been caused by those politicians who were unable to conceal the fact that although dully elected by democratic governments they had been unable to conceal their remarkably poor powers of judgment common sense and in fact any noticeable brainy qualities
4571934 in this climate of politics the fact that you are known is quite crucial on that basis i will say that the choice of dr bawumia three months to a general elections would not favour the npp it could actually be detrimental
4571935 the choice of dr bawumia does not do that while the choice of mahama does that for the ndc
4571936 look at the ndc campaign we have a flag bearer who goes out on his own no problem we have a running mate who has demonstrated clearly that he can go out on his own in any region of the country and get the reaction that you would expect even of a presidential candidate
4571937 now there is proof that nearly all hospital infections are avoidable when doctors and staff clean their hands and rigorously practice proper hygiene and other preventive measures
4571938 cause the next wave of class action lawsuits bigger than the litigation over asbestos
4571939 numerous lawsuits have been filed against hospitals in florida kentucky and elsewhere by infected patients
4571940 being sued are saying that their infection rates are within national norms
4571941 we have the knowledge to prevent infections whats been lacking is the will
4571942 insurance companies that sell liability coverage to hospitals could change that by offering lower premiums to hospitals that rigorously follow infection prevention protocols
4571943 to be sure lawsuits are not the best way to improve patient care
4571944 many verdicts are unjustified and few truly injured patients find a lawyer to take their case
4571945 coming wave of lawsuits as well as financial incentives from medicare and insurers will fight complacency about hospital hygiene
4571946 many of the chronic diseases that we have found in the community can be prevented or controlled with more health education
4571947 we have to start giving people the tools and we havent been doing it

4571951 as you are all aware flood constitutes one of the deadliest and costliest disasters worldwide and causes about 40 of fatalities from natural disasters according to wmo flood along with other hydro meteorological or rainfall related disasters account for about 90 of lives lost in natural disasters affecting over 520 million people across the globe resulting in up to 250 000 deaths in a single year
4571952 about two billion people have been projected to become vulnerable to flood by 2050 as a result of climate change the current rainfall pattern over the country confirms this worrisome trend while the length of the rainy season has significantly shrunk there is no appreciable change in the amount of rainfall that fall within the period the resulting higher rainfall intensity has increased the vulnerability of most parts of the country to floods
4571953 frequently experience storm surges from the gulf of guinea resulting in massive flooding with significant economic loss we have several dams in many parts of the country constructed for flood control and water supply when these structures fail or are to properly attended fail or are not properly attended to we end up with flood in adjoining downstream communities

4571976 i dont know why he feels that he has to exaggerate and make some of this stuff up
4571977 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4571978 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4571979 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4571980 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4571981 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

4571983 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4571984 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4571985 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4571986 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4571987 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4571988 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4571989 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4571990 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4571991 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4571992 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4571993 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4571994 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4571995 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4571996 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4571997 what do you want your look to say to people
4571998 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4571999 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4572000 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4572001 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4572002 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4572003 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4572004 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4572005 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4572006 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4572007 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4572008 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4572009 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4572010 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4572011 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4572012 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4572013 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

4572023 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4572024 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4572025 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4572026 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4572027 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4572028 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4572029 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4572030 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4572031 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4572032 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4572033 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4572034 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4572035 after watching a five hour rough cut of the film composer michel legrand took a six week vacation during which he wrote 90 minutes of music the film was then reedited to the music instead of the other way around if this experiment had failed legrand would have written a second score in the traditional way free of charge
4572036 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4572037 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4572038 how can i explain it im a midwesterner and we tend to answer when spoken to no matter the source
4572039 but casey it was so graceful i thought you did it on purpose
4572040 the question of agricultural subsidies has prompted some people to suggest that india should step out of the wto such a step would be self defeating we would be singled out and left without support
4572041 this implies that over next four five years subsidies would definitely be on their way out
4572042 most of the banks under our coverage witnessed margin pressures during the quarter in line with the recent rate hikes announced by the rbi further a weaker treasury performance on account of the higher bond yields the downturn in the equity markets and the high base of the last year added to the woes of banks
4572043 there is no slowdown at all indian bank had a credit growth of 4 200 crore in the first quarter this year as against rs 800 crore last year there is high demand from every industry including power telecom infrastructure cement sugar or composite sugar mills
4572044 aggressive monetary tightening steps taken by the central bank coupled with the ensuing deposit rate hikes are likely to put further pressure on the margins of banks the firming up of bond yields could result in additional mtm losses in coming quarters
4572045 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4572046 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4572047 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4572048 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4572049 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4572050 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4572051 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4572052 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4572053 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4572054 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4572055 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4572056 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4572057 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4572058 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4572059 the basic problem is that the people who are acquiring these properties they dont understand or want to understand that tenants have rights in san francisco
4572060 you cant just go in and tell them to leave you cant shut off utilities you cant call the police you cant do any of that stuff
4572061 were talking about a pretty small additional increase to get these animals out of these horrible crammed cages
4572062 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4572063 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4572064 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4572065 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4572066 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4572067 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4572068 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4572069 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4572070 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4572071 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4572072 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4572073 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4572074 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4572075 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4572076 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4572077 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4572078 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4572079 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4572080 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4572081 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4572082 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4572083 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4572084 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4572085 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4572086 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4572087 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4572088 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4572089 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4572090 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4572091 just so you all know we did set a record
4572092 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4572093 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4572094 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4572095 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4572096 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4572097 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4572098 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4572099 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4572100 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4572101 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4572102 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4572103 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4572104 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4572105 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4572106 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4572107 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4572108 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4572109 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4572110 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4572111 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4572112 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4572113 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4572114 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4572115 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4572116 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4572117 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4572118 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4572119 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4572120 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4572121 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4572122 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4572123 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4572124 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4572125 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4572126 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4572127 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4572128 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4572129 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4572130 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4572131 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4572132 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4572133 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4572134 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4572135 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4572136 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4572137 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4572138 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4572139 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4572140 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4572141 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4572142 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4572143 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4572144 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4572145 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4572146 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4572147 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4572148 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4572149 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4572150 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4572151 it was a grease fire looks like it started in the kitchen but the inspector will
4572152 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4572153 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4572154 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4572155 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4572156 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4572157 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4572158 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4572159 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4572160 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4572161 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4572162 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4572163 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4572164 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4572165 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4572166 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4572167 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4572168 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4572169 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4572170 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4572171 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4572172 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4572173 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4572174 it all started in the fifth grade when i made my mom buy me some physics books
4572175 since then my interest in physics has grown and i am looking forward to combining my two interests astrophysics and computer programming
4572176 the students will experience a hundred percent hands on research
4572177 once they start classes they will be included in a distinguished research team focused on radio pulsars students will also be immersed in research projects where they will get the chance to pursue their own curiosity and perform research based on their interests
4572178 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4572179 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4572180 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4572181 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4572182 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4572183 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4572184 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4572185 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4572186 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4572187 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4572188 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4572189 i dont want to be known as a second half guy i want to be known as a full season guy
4572190 second half guys dont get a chance to get to the second half if they dont have a good first half
4572191 whats strange with what weve seen from garret the last couple of years is his second half surge
4572192 he had been so consistent from start to finish you never noticed huge upswings or downswings its a trend you have to look at but its tough to put a finger on any one thing
4572193 theres no correlation there it doesnt take a lot to get going but it doesnt necessarily mean that im going to be successful i can still get hits even when my swing is not there but to keep building momentum i need to play every day and have my at bats pile up
4572194 thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates web site who were not facebook members
4572195 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4572196 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4572197 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
4572198 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
4572199 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box
4572200 the family considers cash to be jakes hero because without her we probably would not have had a body to bring home
4572201 as weeks went by we hoped hed walk back in one day like hed been on vacation or something
4572202 having cash now is like having him with us it is the silver lining
4572203 cash had to have found a water source somewhere the morning dew off of the grass or maybe she found a puddle somewhere
4572204 she might have even resorted to eating small rodents for water
4572205 it sounds like such a strong bond that this dog will kill or die so to speak for this owner
4572206 dogs are extremely loyal to humans i dont think there is any other creature on the planet that is as loyal
4572207 jake was trying to be brave for everyone and not show he had been losing his ground
4572208 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
4572209 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home prescription drugs are the drug of choice for teens who are trying drugs for the first time they are getting drugs from their parents or their grandparents medicine cabinets
4572210 more and more they are coming in strung out on prescription pill opiates
4572211 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4572212 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4572213 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4572214 and therefore a lot of people already know the value of the product
4572215 its the only bottle of water that you can carry with one finger
4572216 we looked at it with our store managers and also our executive management and everybody said wow how come we havent done this before
4572217 said bob mahlstede president of the catalina mart convenience chain which stocks fria in 12 of its 18 stores
4572218 what we are seeing graphically at organ pipe was predictable this is what happens when you circumvent environmental laws
4572219 when you build an impediment across a stream it becomes a dam and providing some holes in a fence is a joke
4572220 whatever is in the path of the redirected water flow will be damaged whether thats vegetation and natural resources or manmade structures
4572221 its something that has been anticipated and unfortunately has apparently been ignored in the rush to build this wall
4572222 i would just like to have them come back and re evaluate the structure
4572223 they need to come up with a process to be able to remove the debris prior to reaching the fence or the alter the design of the fence to accommodate more flow
4572224 it would be like putting your finger on the end of the water hose
4572225 you are restricting the water flow that is what the fence is doing
4572226 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4572227 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4572228 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4572229 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4572230 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4572231 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4572232 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4572233 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4572234 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4572235 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4572236 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4572237 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4572238 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4572239 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4572240 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4572241 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4572242 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4572243 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4572244 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4572245 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4572246 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4572247 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4572248 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4572249 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4572250 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4572251 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4572252 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4572253 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4572254 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4572255 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4572256 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4572257 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4572258 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4572259 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4572260 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4572261 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4572262 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4572263 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4572264 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4572265 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4572266 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4572267 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4572268 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4572269 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4572270 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4572271 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4572272 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4572273 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4572274 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4572275 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4572276 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4572277 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4572278 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4572279 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4572280 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4572281 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4572282 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4572283 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4572284 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4572285 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4572286 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4572287 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4572288 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4572289 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4572290 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4572291 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4572292 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4572293 a m me gusta ser muy reservado en estas cosas mucho m s cuando est involucrada una persona con much simo poder en el gobierno todav a soy tolerante pero no me inmiscuyo en pol tica hasta donde s el babalao v ctor betancourt es independiente no pertenece al consejo de los yoruba cubanos respet su decisi n y la de los participantes
4572294 vamos a pedir por la salud de fidel castro y la del pueblo cubano la salud humana es lo primero y la de un mandatario determina un pueblo entero
4572295 ive been having troubles with my fitness and pain in my calf but i was all set to race and then the team booked a time trial
4572296 to put somebody through that the day before their first ever major international is absolutely appalling it took so much out of me and today there was nothing in my legs
4572297 she was given pain killing injections and asked to run 2km at a reasonable pace to confirm she could perform in the race
4572298 i just wanted to step on it a little bit in the first 50 and try and get out to an early lead if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4572299 if he wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good without him i wouldnt be standing here today
4572300 i think if it were all over today hed be the greatest olympian who ever lived
4572301 i put myself in solitary confinement to think about things after the holland game
4572302 i was hard on myself because i felt gutted for the lads who had worked so hard
4572303 scoring the goal was quite a nice feeling to say the least
4572304 a good result against canada is important so we can definitely have a crack at fifth sixth and it would be nice to have a sniff at the semis
4572305 it was our poorest performance so far because we looked tired and lethargic but i am very pleased with the result
4572306 hey this is you and stagg people want to live like you two
4572307 no this is more like what we are its hard work
4572308 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
4572309 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4572310 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4572311 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4572312 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4572313 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the home town of hall of famers like the
4572314 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4572315 mr bale who denies the allegation co operated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police
4572316 im just looking forward to getting in the race and getting on with it
4572317 i know its going to be tough and im going to fight harder than ive ever fought out there but im looking forward to it
4572318 ive fought harder than ive ever fought just to get to this point so i want to get in there and justify the work ive been doing
4572319 ideally id have done a lot more running but i havent been able to
4572320 ive done what ive been able to do and i cant go into this race with any regrets im glad i pushed it at every opportunity there were times when it was really hard but getting this far has given me a mental lift
4572321 others may think paula risks failure but i dont think she considers that what paula is doing underlines the value the importance and the meaning of the olympics
4572322 what she has achieved to get to the start line has been nothing short of extraordinary it would also be nothing short of mind blowing if she ended up on the podium
4572323 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up whats the worst that can happen and whether youre ok to live with that i knew i was taking a gamble by coming back trying to be here and pushing my leg but they were calculated risks because i was never running through pain
4572324 if you dont ask questions you dont get the answers and you cant move forward the worst that could have happened was that at some point the leg would break down and i wouldnt have been able to do it
4572325 luckily that hasnt happened and hopefully it wont happen for all that the olympic marathon is not a race which i ever want to watch on television and think what i could have done you get in there and give it your best shot
4572326 its something thats just very important to me its important to any athlete its important for me to go out there and run well
4572327 there have been other things in my career which will define it and hopefully there are other things that im going on to achieve
4572328 being one of millions with a close connection to cancer i know i need to do my part
4572329 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4572330 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4572331 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4572332 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
4572333 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever
4572334 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to
4572335 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it
4572336 i remember sitting down with frankie and said nick is in the hospital and hell be home in a couple of days
4572337 alternative university teaching tactics and strategies necessary to force an end to this war
4572338 turn downtown into one massive reminder to the delegates and the public of what war looks like
4572339 mimic the experiences we force on people in iraq palestine and on the u s mexico border
4572340 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4572341 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4572342 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4572343 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4572344 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4572345 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4572346 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4572347 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4572348 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4572349 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4572350 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4572351 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4572352 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4572353 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4572354 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4572355 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4572356 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4572357 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4572358 dan kaminsky discovered a way for hackers to feed fake info into dns listings which would allow hackers to redirect web traffic at will for example routing every person attempting to log in to the bank of america to a fake site controlled by the attacker

4572360 to describe the work of artists who sample the greater sludgepile of internet content
4572361 it is the generic packaging and selling of unique works of art i think industry mediocrity is more of a threat to the future of reading than television is
4572362 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4572363 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4572364 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4572365 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
4572366 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon
4572367 so eat this black music and tell me how it tastes now and f jesse jackson cause it aint about race now
4572368 walk through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front with the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts listening to pictures of don imus for target practice
4572369 i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott kings teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot
4572370 i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped
4572371 just me taking flight man this album is gonna be real special from beginning to end its gonna knock
4572372 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing

4572374 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4572375 id love to if i can find the right movie
4572376 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4572377 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4572378 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4572379 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4572380 we have a large market in the payroll debit card space that we issue to companies of all sizes the concept of workers comp has a strong correlation to payroll
4572381 it was just a natural extension to issue the workers comp card as a complement to our payroll card
4572382 this offers a convenient alternative to checks for insurance companies and individuals
4572383 the funds are immediately available and the reload is done in the same manner as a direct deposit once you have the card theres no waiting for a check to arrive in the mail
4572384 youre just adding volume the client sends us an enrollment file and we issue the cards its just a regular payment run
4572385 insurers do not have access to the card behavior data we maintain cardholder confidentiality
4572386 having the ability to provide an additional payment option to our claimants provides us with a competitive market advantage and enables us to streamline our claims paying process
4572387 how confident are you feeling with these skills i just presented one means not at all 10 means really confident 5 is half and half

4572393 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4572394 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4572395 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4572396 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4572397 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4572398 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4572399 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4572400 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4572401 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4572402 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4572403 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4572404 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4572405 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4572406 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4572407 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4572408 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4572409 es cierto que la regla es pareja para todo el mundo pero la medida es peligrosa porque un equipo m s d bil te puede ganar
4572410 no me parece bien que se ubiquen a los corredores en bases sin haber tenido un resultado que les conceda ese derecho
4572411 we will not vote for a mccain ticket unless 1 mike huckabee is the vp or 2 mike huckabee is the keynote speaker at the national gop convention
4572412 fred is mccains trusted friend and advisor they are fishing buddies and have been close for years it is very important that we contact fred and let him know
4572413 so now we know what mccain thinks of us and our issues he is only concerned with catering to the independent voters we who supported mike huckabee the millions of voters who earned him a 2nd place in delegate count are being ignored by mccain
4572414 mccain must know that he will lose not only michigan without us but the election at this point he does not have us weve tried repeatedly to reach out to him and he has ignored us
4572415 this would be good something to help out the world
4572416 corporate taxes are most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes

4572418 im excited about racing the daytona superbike class for team m4 emgo suzuki
4572419 i feel really good on the 600cc bikes and it looks like its going to be interesting so im hoping to do good next year i dont know too many details about the rules just yet but its supposed to be a very level class very competitive which should be exciting the team has been great for me ever since i joined them and by now everything is very familiar we should only improve as we continue to work together
4572420 i think its going to be good that everyone will be on the same tires there wont be any advantages from one brand to another it will level the competition and it should be good for the spectators and make for some exciting racing
4572421 hes a fantastic racer and can be a real difference maker on the track were excited to continue on with martin as racing makes some big changes for next season
4572422 ama sports is committed to the best interests of the racers first and foremost and working with a strong partner on this championship is the right answer the opportunity to work with ccs allows us to take the road race grand championships to the next level
4572423 we are excited to be working with the entire ccs team and the future is brighter than ever for amateur road racing with their cooperation
4572424 we as an organization are excited about the opportunity to help with the operational aspect of this event
4572425 the ama sports road race grand championships have started a history of top level competition across all club levels and were proud to be part of it not just this year but in the future as well
4572426 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race
4572427 shes a businesswoman and sees her shows as work not a party for all of her friends
4572428 she doesnt think having celebrities in the front seats makes her cool
4572429 oh then you should have slumped over the passenger seat and flopped around like you were in pain
4572430 a man doesnt learn to understand anything unless he loves it
4572431 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up

4572441 watch for more consolidation since small vendors and weak larger vendors find it hard to thrive in the new environment scm vendors will need to increase the functionality and depth of their products to continue to compete as best of breed vendors erp vendors will buy some while others will merge with or get acquired by other scm vendors
4572442 the acquisition by its very nature is controversial an icon of supply chain technology will be taken over by a company that three years ago had no presence in the industry lets look at the reality of the situation though i2 has lost 99 5 of its shareholder value since 2000 the company was on the block for 18 months and amr research is aware of only one other party francisco partners lead investor in redprairie that gave it a serious look the i2 board made it very plain that the company was for sale and that their intent wasnt to put it in a holding pattern until the next ken sharma or sanjiv sidhu i2s co founders appeared
4572443 believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america
4572444 stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
4572445 it is important that social political and religious freedoms grow in china a society which recognizes religious freedom is a society which will recognize political freedom as well
4572446 god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
4572447 chinese foreign ministry issued a curt statement that bristled with anger over any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs
4572448 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts

4572467 apple has had the same problem in every market where the 3g iphone is sold
4572468 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4572469 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4572470 however unwise we evangelicals are often too quick to dismiss healing demonic deliverance miracles and prophetic words of knowledge and wisdom
4572471 in imitation of jesus ministry the church is invited to exercise the miraculous power of the spirit in the service of the kingdom
4572472 frequently you are too cautious and too concerned about being in control to allow things to get messy and to take risks where you may look foolish if gods manifest presence does not show up too often there is a rigid controlling fearful spirit among you too often you are defensive and stuck in tradition for its own sake there is too little power in your churches too little extravagant worship in which your people pour out their hearts to god on sunday too much of your churchs accomplishments can be explained without there needing to be a god to explain them things are too predictable and too well american
4572473 you are too anti intellectual if i hear another third wave or pentecostal charismatic speaker say god offends the mind to reveal the heart i think ill scream why dont we also hear you say that god offend the heart to reveal the mind i fear this statement is often an excuse for intellectual laziness
4572474 dallas willard says that we should come to the point that we expect to see the miraculous outbreak of the kingdom take place as an ordinary part of our extraordinary christian lives
4572475 to what degree will we expect to see the spirit work in miraculous ways
4572476 to what degree should we encourage people to seek miraculous works today
4572477 to what extent do we see church life in the n t as a pattern for us to imitate today
4572478 how much space will we provide during services for the miraculous work of the spirit beyond just the teaching and singing
4572479 let the proud deride me o god and all whom you have not yet laid low and humiliated for the salvation of their souls but let me still confess my sins to you for your honor and glory allow me i beseech you to trace again in memory my past deviation and to offer you a sacrifice of joy without you i am my own guide to the brink of perdition and even when all is well with me what am i but a creature suckled on your milk and feeding on yourself the food that never perishes and what is any man if he is only man let the strong and mighty laugh at men like me let us the weak and the poor confess our sins to you
4572480 when youre in love with something you dont have to work hard to want to know it
4572481 we were doing fine for 500 years as a pagan nation until everyone started converting to cnty

4572491 their busy lifestyles dont leave much time to spend at laundromat
4572492 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

4572538 i want to say this about my state when strom thurmond ran for president we voted for him were proud of it and if the rest of the country had followed our lead we wouldnt have had all these problems over all these years either
4572539 there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base
4572540 there is peace now because mr clinton signed it all this peace i love it

4572546 facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictates of our passion they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence
4572547 if you want a preview of what the united states would be like under a president obama just look at georgias recent actions georgian president saakashvili like barack obama is owned by the same british godfather george soros
4572548 would soross man obama be another dick cheney if he got into office
4572549 now look at the vast soros cash flow into obama
4572550 soros is a british agent under the control of british foreign intelligence and special operations services he is used by them his sources of funds after his initial bankrolling by the swiss branch of the rothschild banking interests are murky at best soros is part of britains new opium war apparatus and he virtually owns senator obama and now he is fomenting world war provocations against moscow at precisely the moment that i am calling on russia china and india to join the united states in creating a new international financial system that would wipe out speculators like soros altogether
4572551 i knew barack obama for many years as my state senator when he used to attend events in the palestinian community in chicago all the time i remember personally introducing him onstage in 1999 when we had a major community fundraiser for the community center in deheisha refugee camp in the occupied west bank and thats just one example of how barack obama used to be very comfortable speaking up for and being associated with palestinian rights and opposing the israeli occupation
4572552 you know my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called lake winola outside of scranton and taught me how to shoot when i was a little girl
4572553 she is running around talking about how this is an insult to sportsmen how she values the second amendment shes talking like shes annie oakley
4572554 bill oreilly will never get that sean hannitys stupid fantasy will keep him forever stuck on stupid when it comes to comprehending how you can love a brother who does not believe what you believe pinchams faith was a faith in a god who loved the whole world not just one country or one creed
4572555 investment company seeks partner for several properties in the your county area we have secured special access to non listed properties that are direct to seller
4572556 the legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others but it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
4572557 facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictates of our passion they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence
4572558 that 8 9 million is almost what we had in the last general election
4572559 this is a huge turnout for a primary 1 million more than any previous primary
4572560 cherish therefore the spirit of our people and keep alive their attention do not be too severe upon their errors but reclaim them by enlightening them if once they become inattentive to the public affairs you and i and congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves
4572561 americans have yet to confront these choices but in other countries they have been dealing with them for years go through the intensive care unit of new york hospital and count the number of octogenarians who are there with heroic intervention techniques and a dismal quality of life then go to a hospital in london and observe the difference in the age composition what is it they do in great britain they have capped their medical costs a neurologist caring for stroke patients with a dismal prognosis turns them over to their general practitioner who sends them home to die quietly of pneumonia the old mans friend would americans accept the level of health care rationing this implies maybe not but we will soon need to face the question
4572562 its the elite who matter in future britain must concentrate on educating the top 5 on whose success we shall all depend
4572563 the slaughter in waco by government stormtroopers under the command of field marshal attorney general reno may pale in comparison to what has been planned for late march a nationwide batf fbi assault on private militias as the prelude to a possible declaration of martial law throughout the united states should reno be stupid enough to actually attack them militarily there is going to be a lot of blood
4572564 while john mccain has risen to the top of the heap among contenders for the republican presidential nomination focus on the family founder james dobson remains adamant that he will not support mccains bid for the white house
4572565 madame president clinton his honor the first husband billl clinton
4572566 you dont like my lifestyle fuck you im rolling with the new jack crew
4572567 the darien gap railway connector would be approximately 85 to 95 miles 136 to 152 km long and could go by either a central lowland route parallel to the uncompleted pan american highway or by an elevated hill and mountain route to the east of the pan american highway
4572568 through thick tropical rain forests in parallel to the chucunaque and tuira rivers where heavy rainfall thick jungles insects and snakes plus frequent flooding would be major problems over much of the year the alternative eastern mountain route would go over the serran a del dari n mountains to the atlantic drainage side over relatively gentle grades through rolling hills with maximum elevations of 1 500 to 2 000 feet 455 to 610 meters through heavy tropical forests
4572569 a significant challenge would be involved no matter what routes were chosen
4572570 the western lowlands route would be shorter in length but would go through flood prone areas with heavy rainfall and would have to be built through a national park the eastern highland route would be longer but would be able to avoid much of the flood prone areas and would probably not need any tunnels and would not have to be built on an elevated course way
4572571 i always know what is expected of me thats nothing new of course it always hurts to see the guys going out there you miss the camaraderie
4572572 i can do breaks and in cuts the consistency and endurance are still not where they have to be
4572573 the one thing i have learned is that you cant please everyone
4572574 its been a wonderful year obviously everything that has happened with this football team and for me personally at the same time you cant please everyone
4572575 oh we hate the united states so much its good let them collapse let them crash against the wall
4572576 this is an outrage im representing the european union sarkozy has nothing to say this is not a measure of national government
4572577 its very unfortunate to present the desperation of millions of vulnerable people in their struggle to feed themselves as an opportunity
4572578 oh this is wonderful three quarters of mankind has just adopted a new world economic order when are you going to publish it
4572579 oh thats not newsworthy well not publish it at all
4572580 we dont fear the bullets of the police because we are starving anyway so what does it matter
4572581 we dont need the united states we can operate we can help europe
4572582 well what can you do i have to wait for the enemy to destroy himself then i can do something
4572583 all likely to get worse in the coming 24 months
4572584 the atmosphere of terror cannot be countered mainly by military means we cannot win through a war of attrition afghanistan will not be solved by the addition of two or three more us combat brigades from our rapidly unraveling army
4572585 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
4572586 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there was no such thing as student loans
4572587 what if the next case is worse no one in government seems to feel a responsibility for warning about such possibilities and formulating a detailed policy for dealing with them
4572588 bankruptcy law is a good place to start after all the dreaded financial meltdown would amount to a wave of bankruptcies what would happen to the economy if hedge funds had to liquidate one after another in a financial crisis we need to rethink the theory and practice of bankruptcy given the new complexities
4572589 subsidized system of triage would be needed to identify which companies should be saved with the main criterion being the possible economic impact of their liquidation
4572590 if you want a preview of what the united states would be like under a president obama just look at georgias recent actions georgian president saakashvili like barack obama is owned by the same british godfather george soros
4572591 would soros man obama be another dick cheney if he got into office
4572592 europe needs to figure out a way to come together to fight back against russian aggression
4572593 it is therefore time for the eu to agree at least in principle to a common response to these shows of russian aggression when the next crisis comes all european states will need to be prepared

4572612 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4572613 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4572614 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4572615 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect

4572618 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
4572619 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
4572620 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up

4572625 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4572626 is not something we are going to comment on further
4572627 it would have been a very lengthy and drawn out process even though we believe we would have been successful
4572628 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4572629 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4572630 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4572631 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4572632 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4572633 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4572634 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4572635 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4572636 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4572637 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4572645 elementary age children and young intermediate age children probably need 10 hours of nightly sleep and then the adolescents need at least nine but thats sort of a beginning point
4572646 its important to return to the schedule gradually because if you ask a child whos been going to sleep at 10 or 11 all summer all of a sudden to fall asleep at 8 then chances are theyre not going to be able to fall asleep at that earlier time
4572647 feel tired later and want to sleep later and thats a biological tendency
4572648 they have to wake up early they get sleep deprived during the week and then they do sort of catch up sleep on the weekends or take after school naps
4572649 sleeping in longer than an hour can really cause problems with their sleep schedule

4572690 how unsuitable does this site have to be before fingal county council see sense and abandon their plans
4572691 from the beginning we have stated that this site is wrong for this kind of development and the archaeological survey demanded by an bord plean la found such important evidence that the hearing must now be reopened

4572810 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4572811 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off

4572814 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4572815 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4572816 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4572817 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative

4572971 how the lifeguards set the flags varies depending on where the location of the breaks are which are the waves the surfers will want to play on

4572977 when surfing is optimal then the swimming area would be smaller
4572978 the policy is that the lifeguards are to park on ocean boulevard if any spaces are to be had within a reasonable walking distance

4573086 generally speaking though americans have an inability to relax into sheer pleasure ours is an entertainment seeking nation but not necessarily a pleasure seeking one americans spend billions to keep themselves amused with everything from porn to theme parks to wars but thats not exactly the same thing as quiet enjoyment americans dont really know how to do nothing this is the cause of that great sad american stereotype the overstressed executive who goes on vacation but who cannot relax
4573087 when you sense a faint potentiality for happiness after such dark times you must grab onto the ankles of that happiness and not let go until it drags you face first out of the dirt this is not selfishness but obligation you were given life it is your duty and also your entitlement as a human being to find something beautiful within life no matter how slight
4573088 my guru once said that you should never give yourself a chance to fall apart because when you do it becomes a tendency and it happens over and over again you must practice staying strong instead
4573089 the devout of this world perform their rituals without guarantee that anything good will ever come of it of course there are plenty of scriptures and plenty of priests who make plenty of promises as to what your good works will yield or threats as to the punishments awaiting you if you lapse but to even believe all this is an act of faith because nobody amongst us is shown the endgame devotion is diligence without assurance faith is a way of saying yes i pre accept the terms of the universe and i embrace in advance what i am presently incapable of understanding theres a reason we refer to leaps of faith because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable and i dont care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove to you through scripture that their faith is indeed rational it isnt if faith were rational it wouldnt be by definition faith faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch faith is walking face first and full speed into the dark if we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of god and the destiny of our souls our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity it would just be a prudent insurance policy

4573091 if the only way to really know god is through his son jesus and its a question of eternal life or eternal punishment why doesnt god make himself more evident reveal himself in an undeniable way
4573092 that was a turnaround for many of the jews who were with mary they saw what jesus did and believed in him
4573093 but some went back to the pharisees and told on jesus
4573094 this man keeps on doing things creating god signs if we let him go on pretty soon everyone will be believing in him and the romans will come and remove what little power and privilege we still have
4573095 now he commands all people everywhere to repent for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead

4573139 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
4573140 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen
4573141 too many people are now not taking important medicines for pain depression and other illnesses because the nejm jama the lancet and the british medical journal have allowed their political love fest with the leftists in the media and their hatred of drug companies to pollute their ability to remain objective
4573142 setting aside dr grahams contribution to the vioxx populi literature which an fda advisory committee considered to be a rather shoddy piece of research he also helped push through the statistical analysis and organize the public outcry over ssris that resulted in a decline in antidepressant use and a corresponding increase in teen suicides

4573147 sidney wolfe public citizens general secretary of junk science has just filed a citizens petition with the fda calling for a black box warning on ed medications because of 48 events of naion non arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy a loss of vision that is frequently irreversible
4573148 has once again failed in this responsibility these drugs need much stronger warnings especially a black box warning such as the one we have proposed
4573149 heres usa today crawling through the mud past janet woodcock who officially speaks for the fda to talk to david graham about avandia
4573150 powerful members of congress want to remake the food and drug administration by giving it broad powers to levy fines order drug recalls and restrict drug industry advertising
4573151 perhaps most importantly they want the next president to appoint a tough fda commissioner completely independent from the industry
4573152 messrs dingell and grassley and their allies have ordered about 20 investigations of drugs and issues involving the fda
4573153 mr grassley began his campaign to overhaul the fda in 2004 during an uproar about the agencys slow reaction to potential links between popular antidepressants and teen suicides
4573154 now he has four staffers and a parade of fda whistleblowers helping him investigate a plethora of fda controversies such as its approval of the antibiotic ketek
4573155 some current and former fda safety reviewers have opened a whistleblower website to air their concerns that fda leaders are pushing them to approve some drugs
4573156 a website launched and operated by current and former us food and drug administration staff who believe public health is being put at unnecessary risk these concerned civil servants and ex civil servants have either experienced or are aware of wrongful directives by us fda upper management directives that put public health at avoidable risk
4573157 interesting omnibus piece from by warren ross of medical marketing amp media on the various slings and arrows being tossed at the worlds premier medical regulatory agency
4573158 weep and whine and try to get decisions made that are based on politics rather than on science
4573159 the motive may be either to get drugs approved or not approved it cuts both ways
4573160 good thing she didnt include this stirring stupak statement from an la times article about why andy von eschenbach sandy kweder janet woodcock and the fdas cafeteria guy should resign
4573161 the drug companies know that this administration will do nothing to them there is no fear of the fda with this culture with laissez faire oversight and regulation i think they should be gone if we get rid of them it will put the drug companies on notice
4573162 heparin hypocrisy hyped up safety fears on adhd drugs does medicaid kill poor people
4573163 yet another show trial held by another congressional committee on the fda there have been four or five over the last two months on heparin alone
4573164 who is gaining momentum along with the fda in shifting the agency towards a science and systems based approach to regulation using real time technology to promote full time compliance has to sit and take the following from the likes of bart stupak d michigan
4573165 last year this nations regulatory failures resulted in dead dogs and cats this year it has tragically led to the deaths of people
4573166 if we dont make some rapid progress on fixing the foreign drug inspection program the next melamine or heparin tragedy will soon be upon us
4573167 coming from a guy who helped push up the suicide rates by scaring parents away from antidepressants and who is pushing for drug importation at a time when al qaeda and hezbollah are involved in drug counterfeiting
4573168 andy must have to shower after sitting through such a show trial
4573169 meanwhile the steve nissen fear factory spews out another piece of tabloid medicine ekg monitoring of all kids getting stimulants for adhd
4573170 now theres a way to achieve nissen who has never studied adhd goal of making a physicians hand quiver before writing a scrip for the drug
4573171 scott gottlieb is a lot of things public servant physician pundit he is my former colleague at the fda most importantly he is my friend
4573172 and my blood boils with anger and frustration at todays scurrilous attack on him in the seattle times
4573173 scott i know personally i know that he takes his work at the fda seriously i know that he takes his government oath to protect the public health seriously i know that he is highly ethical and honest and i know how much this article must hurt him personally
4573174 and im sure that is precisely why certain lupine elements are gleefully forwarding this ugly hit piece to their friends and colleagues
4573175 if people dont agree with his policy positions they should dispute them firmly strongly logically and respectfully
4573176 that they have chosen character assassination only shows the weakness of their intellectual arguments as well as their disappointing lack of character
4573177 new and better way to establish drug safety that solves a one of the more serious problems in drug development namely that animal studies are often a poor and inaccurate substitute for what happens in human
4573178 sid wolfe has opposed every effort to speed drugs to dying patients since he has been on his anti patient jihad starting in 1970
4573179 since his organization makes money by hawking a book worst pills best pills that argues the most drugs are dangerous
4573180 is partially responsible for the decline in ssri prescription use and the corresponding increase in adolescent suicide
4573181 and this guy is head of the health subcommittee why is he being taken seriously why isnt he being held accountable
4573182 ssris have not been proven effective in treating adolescent depression to the contrary their use may actually increase the suicide rate of its young patients
4573183 in response to these reports of increased suicide rates with ssri use fda officials suppressed their own post marketing surveillance prohibited fda employees from discussing the report and launched an investigation to find the person who leaked information to the press today ssris remain on the market without a clear medical benefit to the patient
4573184 there should be a black box warning around everything stupak says regarding medicines
4573185 particularly ssris which have been shown to benefit patients and are associated with a decline in suicides
4573186 dr healy recently testified at the fda hearing on antidepressants he is a psychiatry professor at cardiff university in wales but also according to the new york times has worked for plaintiffs lawyers in cases brought against pharmaceutical companies thats transparency
4573187 when i served as associate commissioner at the fda dr healy visited with me but he never mentioned that he worked for the tort bar
4573188 when i went into the fda to meet with peter pitts i made no efforts to conceal my links to trial attorneys some of whom were at the meeting and no efforts were made to conceal my links to the pharmaceutical industry all of which were well known
4573189 because in my experience republicans such as senator grassley and staffers working for them such as emilia desanto have appeared more concerned about and more effective on the issue than anyone else and as a republican appointee i thought peter pitts heart might be in the right place
4573190 what was not well known at the time was that peter pitts was transiting between working for pharmaceutical companies or perhaps not even transiting
4573191 im not sure how many of us would have felt it worth going if we had known his background
4573192 it seems astonishing to me now that with people like peter pitts in fda that it was ever possible to bring the suicidality issues to light
4573193 and again there is no link to ssris and in increase in suicides rather some unclear evidence based on an unvalidated measure called suicidality that includes just talking about self harm in general
4573194 whose flawed study about ssris and suicide triggered a series of events which lead to less ssri use and more suicide
4573195 the increase amounted to roughly 10 percent and that occurred in a year in which new and controversial black box warnings were added to the labeling on the medications
4573196 for his persistence zeal and determination to damage not only the fda but the public health for his effectiveness in fear mongering and willingness to subordinate medical progress to his ascetic view of safety
4573197 but he seems to spend a lot of time in the halls of congress advising members and staff about which fda medical reviewers should be hauled in for polite conversations
4573198 setting aside dr grahams contribution to the vioxx populi literature which an fda advisory committee considered to be a rather shoddy piece of research he also helped push through the statistical analysis and organize the public outcry over ssris that resulted in a decline in antidepressant use and a corresponding increase in teen suicides
4573199 his assertion that avandia should be taken off the market
4573200 is best remembered in 2007 as the conduit for steve nissens half baked meta analysis of avandia
4573201 helped blow out of all appropriate proportion fear about drug safety in general and avandia in particular
4573202 persistent undermining of the fda came close to winning him clipboard top honors for 2007
4573203 the food and drug administration was also negligent in the vioxx case those running the nations public safety agency repeatedly dismissed the concerns of their own scientists and seemed to do everything possible to keep the public in the dark about emerging problems with vioxx
4573204 i wonder how much more money the senator will get from the trial lawyer lizards as a reward for such vituperative rants
4573205 members of congress and senior officials of the fda should be ashamed of themselves for giving graham the chance to not only rant on about vioxx and ssris but to make the same claims about ketek and drugs for schizophrenia

4573220 we interrupt our regularly scheduled one week left before my hebrew final homework extravaganza to bring you this important announcement its freakin gorgeous outside
4573221 i just threw it a little high and the catcher never tried to catch it
4573222 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4573223 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4573224 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4573225 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4573226 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4573227 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4573228 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4573229 you do not do evil to those who do evil to you but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness
4573230 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4573231 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4573232 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4573233 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4573234 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4573235 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4573236 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4573237 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of
4573238 next generation fibre channel storage systems market forecast 2007 2011
4573239 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
4573240 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
4573241 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
4573242 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
4573243 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
4573244 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion
4573245 as soon as i started screaming he turned ran and jumped out the window
4573246 he just grabbed at her in a menancing tone and thats when she started yelling for her husband
4573247 i think theres a bit more planning going into something like that rather than just a crime of opportunity
4573248 he could have gagged me he could have done anything to me

4573357 well make sure they get their unemployment benefits just as soon as they are eligible
4573358 we wont be able at this time to answer questions about how much they can get in unemployment benefits
4573359 because the plant wont be closing until the next quarter so we cant speculate at this point
4573360 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study

4573414 if i could take a guitar lesson from another guitar player it would it have to be beck
4573415 i think most of the music from the eighties sucked
4573416 and this is great because van halen fans that are my age and younger never got to see these songs performed live because of sammys lack of enthusiasm to play them live

4573428 my feeling is it doesnt matter how many kids i have in the school i have the right to make sure that none of them come to school under fear of intimidation
4573429 the fact that we have gotten this far and the fact that we came so close to a victory should send a message to all school boards in the country that if you are banning things based on the fact that it is offensive that violates the constitution

4573438 lifestyles filled with hd high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4573439 as with the previous versions of usb it does have industry wide support throughout the pc ecosystem
4573440 these devices are increasingly offering more storage and so they need a faster way to get data on and off the device there will likely be devices that use usb that will not need all the bandwidth that superspeed provides including mice keyboards and printers however over time as superspeed usb becomes less expensive more devices will add it
4573441 superspeed usb with its increased bandwidth is certainly a threat to newer versions of firewire including firewire s800 s1600 and s3200 which deliver 800 mbps megabits per second 1 6 gbps and 3 2 gbps respectively
4573442 i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt

4573456 my personal opinion and based on my opinion of the christian faith thats not the type of expression a presidential candidate or anyone following the christian faith ought to make
4573457 helps to juxtapose the dna of sen obama with dna of sen mccain
4573458 many in the christian community have not forgotten sen mccain leaving his first wife for his second wife one month after a disfiguring car accident
4573459 those facts are still there they are in the background
4573460 thats not what their mccain campaign wants to bring up before this forum
4573461 these smears on john mccains character and faith expose the utter hypocrisy of barack obamas claim to represent a new kind of politics its disgraceful

4573534 the greedy financial groups seeking to extend their domination over people and lustful for power in every branch of human endeavor

4573591 theres not a whole lot of places in seattle where you can you either go out and have a good time or go out to dinner and we want to create a dining experience but also a fun place to go out with friends so theres cohesiveness between food and drink and thats what we wanted to do at an honest price

4573752 swimming is probably a skill that youll never know when youll have to call upon it
4573753 we are able to give scholarships to anybody who requests it we do ask if they can pay a portion or not and thats just dependent upon the different families and their needs how much they can pay or how much they cant pay
4573754 i would certainly like to highlight our parks foundation for having the forethought to involve children that dont have the means to take swimming lessons to get that opportunity which is just a phenomenal opportunity i think to learn to swim because its a life skill they can take that with them anywhere
4573755 a lot of our minority students have not in many cases had the opportunity to swim thats why we do this thats one of the reasons why we do this here their drowning rates are much higher
4573756 creo que la ca da del valor de mercado est asociada al precio del petr leo como cay el de la shell y como cayeron todas las empresas petroleras del mundo
4573757 de la misma forma en que cuando el precio del crudo lleg a un r cord dijimos que era un alza de corto plazo creemos que tambi n es un movimiento de ca da de corto plazo
4573758 es previsible que estemos en una tendencia de ca da pero no es definitiva va a volver a subir

4573768 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
4573769 op het moment lijkt iets je een dwaling dat je voorheen als een waarheid of waarschijnlijkheid hebt liefgehad je stoot het af en waant dat je verstand hierin een overwinning bevochten heeft maar misschien was die dwaling toendertijd toen je nog iemand anders was je bent altijd iemand anders even noodzakelijk voor je als al je tegenwoordige waarheden wij ontkennen en moeten ontkennen omdat iets in ons leven zichzelf bevestigen wil iets dat wij misschien nog niet kennen nog niet zien
4573770 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it

4573783 pave the way obama is coming god has returned our son
4573784 i am happy to receive him because i do not have to prepare what to cook for him he is a down to earth person i will give him a meal befitting a grandson

4573805 no problem i will find somebody to come over and help you right away
4573806 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4573807 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4573808 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4573809 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4573810 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4573811 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4573812 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4573813 the first game will probably be a big learning experience

4573818 is inconsistent with both cadences recent public statements and recent communications between mentor graphics and cadence
4573819 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4573820 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4573821 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4573822 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4573823 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4573824 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4573825 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold
4573826 if youre happy with 2 6 however keep on using it you need not upgrade to 2 6 1 if 2 6 is getting the job done
4573827 because it said the money was insufficient and the regulatory hurdles too imposing
4573828 it is unfortunate for mentor graphics shareholders however that despite our best efforts mentor graphics board and management were unwilling to engage in substantive discussions on what we believe would have been a compelling opportunity to create significant value for both companies shareholders and customers mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders
4573829 mentor graphics was aware that as described in the cadence press release cadence was facing challenges in obtaining financing for the transaction additionally today the federal trade commission made a second request indicating that regulatory review of the previously proposed transaction would have been protracted
4573830 james well lets see if i get it youre saying that having weapons with plausible

4573837 you know harry truman once said if you want a friend in washington go out and buy a dog
4573838 as you know over the past several days weve seen that international aggression is tragically not a thing of the past
4573839 we thought we put a lot of that behind us at the end of the 20th century but now its rearing its ugly head in the 21st in the small of nation of georgia
4573840 and he wanted me to say thank you to you
4573841 to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america
4573842 all i can say is i have a long record of experience and background and knowledge vis a vis our relations with russia
4573843 although i was deeply disappointed in russian behavior i must say this is one in a long series of actions taken by prime minister putin that have been of deep and abiding concern for me for a long time
4573844 balls or vajayjay comment they really kicked the drama factor up a notch in this weeks

4573846 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
4573847 the production tax credit is still a valuable component of any u s wind projects revenue model
4573848 that being said the production tax credit has expired three times in the past
4573849 each time there was a substantial hit to the market in the year in which it was allowed to expire but at the same time it was never allowed to expire by the u s congress for more than a maximum of approximately nine to 10 months before it was reinstated
4573850 its primarily been an issue in terms of the timeline for project development or project execution for smaller companies that are not able to effectively negotiate for the available capacity against some of their larger established competitors that have previous energy industry contacts
4573851 and that capacity is increasingly coming on line as we speak essentially to the point that eer is anticipating that there may be potentially a greater level of supply demand parity by as early as 2011
4573852 you have projects across multiple states now that are in the multi gigawatt capacity range in terms of their proposed size
4573853 your webinar was informative with an eye to the special issues that affect cleantech such as regulation and the international policy issues around climate change looking forward to seeing more
4573854 it is being made in georgia today its the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people
4573855 this is the total of my recommendations for right now
4573856 you know harry truman once said if you want a friend in washington go out and buy a dog
4573857 as you know over the past several days weve seen that international aggression is tragically not a thing of the past
4573858 we thought we put a lot of that behind us at the end of the 20th century but now its rearing its ugly head in the 21st in the small of nation of georgia
4573859 and he wanted me to say thank you to you
4573860 to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america
4573861 all i can say is i have a long record of experience and background and knowledge vis a vis our relations with russia
4573862 although i was deeply disappointed in russian behavior i must say this is one in a long series of actions taken by prime minister putin that have been of deep and abiding concern for me for a long time
4573863 the local economy is struggling to keep its head above water
4573864 it is still moving ahead but it is moving slower than slow motion our economy is feeling the effects of the national economic problems including the housing industry downturn the credit industry difficulties and rising inflation
4573865 id rather not see them struggle and be competitive and come out of the gate but realistically i think theres going to be some growing pains
4573866 i think that theyve got to build up their relationships with their crew chiefs and build up whoever those guys are going to be and get that organization to where its running a little bit better i dont foresee just putting a driver in that car and making it perform way better i think that theyre a little bit behind and well have to find out
4573867 well here is the hard part about when you start a new team
4573868 the hardest part of starting a new team is usually you come out of the box good but its when you get into the summer months and you start crashing cars and things start going wrong its how you rebound from that so i will say theyll come out of the gate strong because theyll have a lot of time to prepare and get things situated but the character builders come in the middle of the year
4573869 the risk is that the trial itself cannot be conducted in the way that it should be conducted or indeed that the trial will have to be adjourned or stayed until this problem can be sorted out

4573873 what a shame no one decorated that statue of course im much too busy to do such a thing
4573874 i think there are a few teams waiting on mats to see what he ends up doing
4573875 there are a few teams interested in parrish its preliminary mark is finding out what his interest is as well
4573876 mark is interested in vancouver vollan told cknw hes just sitting back and weighing his options hes just looking for an opportunity and a spot to help a team
4573877 its hopefully going to be the seven justices of the supreme court reviewing that decision
4573878 clear but inaccurate impression that state revenues will replace all eliminated school property tax revenues
4573879 fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4573880 what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first one
4573881 this is one of the most far reaching tax relief proposals that weve ever seen in the state of florida
4573882 everything your borderline competent criminal needs to steal your id
4573883 so far we have contacted 37 people who we can trace items back to
4573884 it puts a stain on the city and makes them not want to come back
4573885 i think its necessary to close for the presidential election i dont see any other way to handle it the town will benefit more than anybody else
4573886 daddy if you brought a new baby it would nurse from mommys boobies
4573887 good on those who are persistent and willing to not let the issue go
4573888 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
4573889 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
4573890 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
4573891 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
4573892 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped

4573910 every day thousands of physicians and patients make myriad choices from available drug options
4573911 they take into account differences in effectiveness side effects and drug interactions for each individual patient fda scientists may know a lot about the drugs they evaluate and their average effects on thousands of users but they know nothing about the individualized physiology of each patient on the other hand intensively trained clinical physicians who do have knowledge of individual patients are best able to advise them if a drug is appropriate
4573912 a market based approach to drug safety information combined with technological advances in diagnostic science will lead to a more vibrant medical marketplace and better outcomes for patients

4573923 based on their discipline within the concert choir ability to read music and whether they serve as section leaders
4573924 i feel like i gained a lot singing in the presbyterian church choir i directed the choir a few sundays and that kind of experience is invaluable
4573925 it was a good community people were ready to incorporate us into the choir not only as singers but also as companions

4573928 i heard from someone who is friends with a musically inclined congregation member that having us join the choir improved special music worship incredibly which was good to hear
4573929 especially because i was doing my senior social work placement in wichita where i was about 25 30 hours a week not including the commute time i was also taking nine hours of classes at the time so i had no time to work which was hurting me because of the gas money the stipend helped me break even sometimes with a little extra
4573930 i think it may be unique to have presbyterians and mennonites through bethel college involved in this kind of relationship

4573953 how can the prime ministers senior adviser possibly accept a position thats dependent on funding from the federal government while continuing to work part time in the prime ministers office
4573954 once again this is a government that is willing to bend break and ignore the rules when its most convenient weve seen it with the in and out scandal weve seen it with stephen harper ignoring his own fixed election dates legislation and now we see it with them violating the spirit of the accountability act
4573955 im told two things that its neither classified nor secret and that its stuff that could be available under access to information
4573956 its a bit of an odd story for someone to find something like that on the side of the road
4573957 we wanted to do something as a class where all the children felt like they contributed to the playground and produce something that would also raise money

4573969 le choix dun candidat au poste de vice pr sident est la d cision la plus importante quun candidat est amen prendre avant l lection pr sidentielle
4573970 la perspective que deux gouverneurs de virginie se succ dent deux soirs cons cutifs la convention est improbable
4573971 nous nous r servons le choix de changer le programme de la convention quand nous le voulons et vous ne devriez faire aucune hypoth se
4573972 that was the main reason why i did it no way would i usually take the lead that early but if youve taken the momentum you may as well keep it going
4573973 i didnt actually want to be in the lead coming into the straight because then you have a target on your back
4573974 it was a pretty ridiculous race it was really fast and im pretty disappointed
4573975 they set a really fast pace and i went out fast with them and kind of died it was the second fastest time ever in history and an olympic record it was an amazing race
4573976 it was my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it and to be honest with you i had a ball out there it was exciting
4573977 but i came back and now im looking forward to next year
4573978 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4573979 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4573980 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4573981 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
4573982 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
4573983 i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
4573984 my whole vision of this has always been about creating community and creating a place where we can not only be free but also the kind of community where youre really connected with the people there and feel comfortable and happy in your environment
4573985 this building will bring together the wild maine blueberry community and the union fair to celebrate the blueberry industry
4573986 everybody here has raked at one time and it celebrates all the work that comes into making blueberries happen
4573987 one of the values of education is that it exposes the general public to the challenges and types of things farmers have to do to produce food every day
4573988 the important thing is that people eat five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day and wed like a few of those servings to be wild blueberries
4573989 now the challenge is to figure out how to effectively use that space
4573990 they have a lot of great ideas and a strong cadre of volunteers and i am sure they are going to keep moving forward over the next few years
4573991 this is the only agricultural fair that hosts a specific building that goes with the fair
4573992 in this building we will have six new vendors who produce exclusively with a focus on blueberries
4573993 we continually invite and encourage younger people to get involved and take advantage of the knowledge base
4573994 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this

4574002 weve had calls placed to pastor warren from very powerful leaders from the left and the right we sent in our personal request and placed numerous phone calls that have not been returned you are not going to be included
4574003 our only option left is to threaten to file an temporary injunction as our attorneys believe they are in violation of the law
4574004 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
4574005 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
4574006 it is to our understanding that pastor warren simply contacted senators mccain and obama to invite them to participate in this forum
4574007 we feel that the addition of congressman bob barr to this event will expand the debate on issues and benefit those who watch and learn from the forum the dialogue between the three main candidates in this election will educate and inform voters more so than a forum that restricts the discussion to the frequently heard talking points of senators obama and mccain
4574008 its not fair you never told me i couldnt do that

4574082 actief met een aantal zaken dat de sdok rechtstreeks aangaat
4574083 dat de sdok al in 2003 van de lijst had geschrapt de heer bor bezocht dit project in de priv sfeer maar men zocht een stok om mee te slaan dat bor zich heeft bemoeid met een project van de sdok spreekt de rechter eveneens tegen
4574084 in eerste instantie heeft de kantonrechter de vordering afgewezen omdat de heer bor de be indiging van de arbeidsovereenkomst had geaccepteerd maar dit was nodig om een bodemprocedure te starten bij de kantonrechter te dordrecht en die heeft de zaak nu tot op de bodem uitgezocht en op 14 juli heeft de rechter uitgesproken dat het ontslag van de heer bor ongegrond en er absoluut geen reden voor was
4574085 dat dit bericht nu al naar buiten komt terwijl de termijn van drie maanden om in hoger beroep te gaan nog niet verstreken is
4574086 ook nu zullen we net als in het verleden gericht zijn op afsluiting van dit dossier handelend in het belang van de stichting
4574087 zes maandsalarissen en de aan bor toegezegde pensioenrechten maar het voorzien in een pensioenregeling is door de sdok nooit betwist terwijl de heer bor in de periode van zijn op non actiefstelling in 2006 een nog ruimere financi le regeling is aangeboden
4574088 maar het leverde niets op uiteindelijk heeft de kantonrechter toen deze uitspraak gedaan
4574089 ook in zijn geval heeft de rechter bepaald dat de sdok hem volledig moest betalen

4574094 the european union has this body which addresses perceived violations of the european human rights convention mr mckinnon believes his rights under that convention have been violated by the uk rulings
4574095 mr mckinnon has never been classified in that manner or treated in that manner as far as im aware
4574096 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime
4574097 at this point and time theres no indication the european court will give any credibility to his argument
4574098 it would be premature for him to believe that he has found a sympathetic shoulder to cry on for all the reasons he didnt prevail in the uk he shouldnt prevail there enough already mr mckinnon

4574137 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4574138 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4574139 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

4574141 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4574142 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4574143 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4574144 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4574145 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4574146 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4574147 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4574148 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4574149 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4574150 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4574151 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4574152 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4574153 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4574154 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4574155 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4574156 our traders have been early adopters of dark pools seeking best execution for clients in bids trading and many other venues for quite some time
4574157 our results in bids trading have been quite positive so were happy to be able to also give our customers the flexibility to access it directly from their desktops if they so choose
4574158 were also excited about bids tradings pending joint venture with nyse which for the first time will link the exchanges deep displayed liquidity with a dark pool making bids trading an even more desirable venue for institutions to access directly
4574159 being selected by rosenblatt a leader in market structure analysis and an authoritative source of monthly adjusted volume figures is a testament to bids tradings approach early success and future prospects
4574160 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4574161 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4574162 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4574163 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4574164 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4574165 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4574166 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4574167 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4574168 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4574169 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4574170 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4574171 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4574172 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4574173 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4574174 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4574175 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4574176 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4574177 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4574178 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4574179 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4574180 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4574181 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4574182 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4574183 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4574184 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4574185 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4574186 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4574187 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4574188 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4574189 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4574190 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4574191 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4574192 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4574193 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4574194 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4574195 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4574196 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4574197 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4574198 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4574199 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4574200 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4574201 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4574202 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4574203 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4574204 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4574205 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4574206 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4574207 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4574208 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4574209 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4574210 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4574211 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4574212 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4574213 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4574214 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4574215 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4574216 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4574217 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4574218 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4574219 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4574220 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4574221 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4574222 who are open to doing something on the production side
4574223 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4574224 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4574225 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4574226 by flooding the market with misleading information while evading the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws these individuals raised millions of dollars over just a few days while duped investors were left holding essentially worthless stock this action continues the commissions efforts to take the profit motive out of these schemes

4574268 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4574269 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4574270 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago

4574276 angela merkels auftritt gestern in sotschi entsprach ganz ihrem blichen stil bei internationalen auftritten unaufgeregt im ton klar in der sache schuldzuweisungen hat sie bewusst gleichm ig auf russland und georgien verteilt ohne den neben ihr stehenden medwedew in der ffentlichkeit zu schonen auch das qualifiziert sie als halbwegs glaubhafte maklerin in der heimat kann sie manchmal nerven mit ihrer art sich blo nie festzulegen sondern immer sch n die moderatorin zu spielen auf der weltb hne kann das durchaus erfolgreich sein
4574277 gut beraten ist die kanzlerin sich weder von moskau noch von tiflis vereinnahmen zu lassen denn beide seiten f hren nach dem ende der kampfhandlungen eine hitzige propagandaschlacht ein erneuter beleg f r die arroganz der politiker die das leid tausender menschen missbrauchen um ihre interessengegens tze auszutragen
4574278 diesmal will angela merkel offenbar mit beharrlichkeit vorankommen sie hat genug realit tssinn um sarkozys traumt nzerischen plan einer eu friedenstruppe abzulehnen stattdessen beschr nkt sie sich darauf die einhaltung des sechs punkte plans zum waffenstillstand und den abzug russischer truppen aus dem kerngebiet georgiens einzufordern und vielleicht gelingt es der kanzlerin ja auch morgen in tiflis m igend auf georgiens pr sidenten saakaschwili einzuwirken das ist das maximum was momentan herauszuholen ist

4574302 natasha brings so much energy and when she comes on the field she brings an excitement and energy to our team
4574303 her physical battle in the air is amazing and there she was finishing on a header
4574304 i see how she is when she comes onto the field when shes waving to the crowd and getting the crowd going that puts a smile on the faces of the people on the field who are already tired and it lifts us up
4574305 for me its the way kai looks a lot of energy a happy smile
4574306 she gives a lot of energy and is very supportive

4574314 we want to scale the network but first were going to see what geographic markets the advertisers are interested in and then well move as quickly as we can

4574318 before you bella my life was like a moonless night very dark but there were stars points of light and reason and then you shot across my sky like a meteor suddenly everything was on fire there was brilliancy there was beauty when you were gone when the meteor had fallen over the horizon everything went black nothing had changed but my eyes were blinded by the light i couldnt see the stars anymore and there was no more reason for anything
4574319 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4574320 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4574321 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4574322 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4574323 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4574324 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4574325 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4574326 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4574327 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4574328 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do

4574392 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4574393 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4574394 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4574411 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4574412 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4574413 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4574414 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4574415 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4574418 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4574419 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4574420 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4574421 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4574422 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4574423 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4574424 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4574434 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4574435 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4574436 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4574458 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west

4574464 el presidente colom dijo seremos un gobierno para los pobres y por lo visto es una realidad me indigna saber que a casi ocho meses de estar en el poder se hable de millonarios desfalcos en el congreso y en el igss y no digamos los miles de quetzales que mensualmente roban en educaci n donde cobran sueldos de muertos destituidos y fantasmas mientras los antes pobres siguen enriqueci ndose los guatemaltecos honrados tenemos que soportar indignados los saqueos la ineptitud y el descaro de nuestros gobernantes guatemaltecos basta ya no sigamos permitiendo que nos humillen y averg encen ante el mundo exijamos justicia y c rcel para todos los corruptos y pidamos la destituci n de cualquiera que est involucrado en il citos

4574473 i conceived of the voices of the southwest series to provide unms summer session with a world class educational and cultural event that would interest a broad spectrum of both students and off campus citizens
4574474 we teamed up with unm press to present the series because no other division of unm had given such a wide voice to southwest culture

4574483 are you ready to respond to my lecture with hyperbolic exultation
4574484 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
4574485 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
4574486 it is to our understanding that pastor warren simply contacted senators mccain and obama to invite them to participate in this forum
4574487 we feel that the addition of congressman bob barr to this event will expand the debate on issues and benefit those who watch and learn
4574488 with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4574489 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4574490 help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4574491 we are seeing the benefits of a renewed emphasis on high school achievement
4574492 schools parents and students are becoming more aware that high school achievement is the launch pad to post secondary success and greater opportunity for a high paying career
4574493 the social studies numbers went down across the board at the state level but when you look at the percent of students who are proficient in social studies its higher than the other categories
4574494 the most significant thing is that both warren mott and sterling heights high school have increased the number of students in the proficient category by 5 1 2 to 6 percent
4574495 with groups of students who were falling into the level three category were just a little below the percentage they needed to make ayp
4574496 that shift in one year is significant and a significant accomplishment by staff due to the districts professional learning communities program
4574497 i attribute all of this to the leadership in the schools to the principals and the teachers who worked with the students
4574498 and we used the parents as a sounding board letting them know the importance of the mme in gaining scholarships and in graduation
4574499 we want to see excellence in every area were very standards based were always preparing students
4574500 east texas families have been forced to postpone or cancel their summer vacations due to the high cost of energy and speaker pelosi and congress should not take theirs until congress takes up energy legislation that offers a long term energy solution and begins to bring down the price at the pump
4574501 i believe that congress has both a duty and a historic opportunity to help free generations of americans from the grip of foreign oil our national security and economic security depends upon us acting now
4574502 would increase the supply of american made energy improve energy conservation and efficiency and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies
4574503 for the foreseeable future we have plenty of energy to produce in america
4574504 unfortunately it is illegal to produce it congress has taken 75 percent of our onshore energy resources off the table making them off limits to energy exploration and production
4574505 we need a long term solution that includes efficiency renewables and alternative energy but we also need to allow americans to produce more american made energy for americans now
4574506 there are things that congress can do about oil and we have voted on this over and over again
4574507 but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
4574508 if we can get some great things in terms of renewable energy resources a renewable electricity standard wind solar biofuels and the rest in that context because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming
4574509 and the consumer is our first responsibility the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore by the way let me make this one final point this oil is owned by the american taxpayers the oil companies drill we give them money to drill there but we get very little in return
4574510 your wife is very beautiful thank you have a nice day
4574511 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4574512 it is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls
4574513 the modern synthesis is obsolete and that a new grasp of evolution is in the making has been argued by numerous authors my purpose here is to highlight some major innovations that have transformed evolution science
4574514 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4574515 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4574516 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4574517 it will take place at saddleback church in orange county california
4574518 i want whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now
4574519 weve had calls placed to pastor warren from very powerful leaders from the left and the right we sent in our personal request and placed numerous phone calls that have not been returned you are not going to be included
4574520 our only option left is to threaten to file an temporary injunction as our attorneys believe they are in violation of the law
4574521 the complaint is based upon a violation of mccain feingold campaign finance legislation while were no fans of that legislation however we dont write the rules were just forced to play by them in this case were using mccain feingold to our advantage
4574522 there are two types of people one finds a way
4574523 uw zoon onthoudt zoveel hij is het slimste kind dat ik ooit gezien heb
4574524 het is wel een stille jongen maar de klas zal hem zeker goed opvangen
4574525 there are a number of ifs in order for the as to stick around because theyve already made that deal down in fremont
4574526 the question is whether that deal will stick or not and ive said to as owner lew wolff if theres anything we can do thats within reason were prepared to do it

4574532 nobody has ever won the presidency by promising to raise taxes
4574533 this is a pretty standard way to do tax reforms in social security
4574534 if we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4574535 the thing about a doughnut hole is that it is empty
4574536 there is nothing and that it seems is what is left of barack obamas plan to fix social security
4574537 make no mistake what obama is really saying is that at least for the campaign he is walking away from social security and all of its problems
4574538 barack obama said he wants to protect middle class families in terms of the taxes they pay in and the benefits they get
4574539 certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was 28 percent
4574540 my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that
4574541 i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
4574542 the one on one counseling will scale because we already have a network of ex ncaa coaches in place across all sports that are recruiting experts and are ready to set up time with athletes

4574559 fast forward almost a year and the mccain campaign has begun to implement some of the same tactics
4574560 i think it shows the campaign is willing to play with the technology and enable their supporters to participate in that flurry of web activity a little supporter participation can go a long way towards feeding energy into a campaign
4574561 in this case the prize will go to the campaign that uses technology most effectively to turn voters out on election day
4574562 all the cool widgets and gadgets and gimmicks in the world cant help you if they dont feed into that mission
4574563 als de weerwolf zou bestaan dan moeten we opletten en zeker geen lawaai maken wees voorbereid op alles

4574565 ik ben remco en dat is joris wij zijn weggelopen van het weerwolf college we willen je best helpen maar wat doe jij hier het is nog lang geen pasen waar heb je ons eigenlijk voor nodig
4574566 ik moest bij het weerwolf college paaseieren afleveren toen stortte achter mij de weg in en ik raakte verdwaald toen ik eindelijk de eieren had afgeleverd was het 13 december en moest ik langs het hol van de weerwolf terug maar hier langer blijven kan ook niet als ik me morgenochtend niet bij het hoofdkwartier van de peb meld word ik ontslagen
4574567 paashaas eieren bezorgdienst duh maar goed kunnen jullie me helpen

4574571 die legende en midasje kunnen me niks schelen kies je nog eerder het hazenpad dan de paashaas
4574572 we moeten dan langs een andere weg proberen te vluchten
4574573 dan moeten we vanuit een ravijn tegen een ongelooflijk steile wand opklimmen
4574574 het hele woud hangt vol met lianen als we daar nou eens een lasso van maken misschien dat we er dan wel komen
4574575 ik kan misschien wel hoog genoeg springen om een lasso vast te maken en als we een paar lianen aan mekaar vastknopen dan moet dat zeker lukken
4574576 ik kom nooit hoog genoeg om een lasso ergens overheen te gooien de rotswand is echt te hoog ik weet dat er ergens nog een tunnel is waar een grote steen voor ligt die hoeven we alleen maar weg te rollen
4574577 stel je niet zo aan joh de paashaas is toch al het haasje
4574578 we moeten toch echt langs het hol zien te komen
4574579 zoon nu heb je weer mijn verjaardag vergeten ik ben het zat
4574580 en nu heb je dat stomme weerwolvenpak weer aan het is schandalig hup doe dat ding uit en kom mee naar huis eigenwijs kreng en dat noemt zich een directeur

4574584 the burning question on everyones mind is what nvidia parts are failing in the field no gt200 jokes here nv personnel are still quite sensitive about that but our moles have told us about the bum gpus
4574585 the short story is that all the g84 and g86 parts are bad period no exceptions all of them mobile and desktop use the exact same asic so expect them to go south in inordinate numbers as well there are caveats however and we will detail those in a bit

4574587 many apple laptop owners are experiencing two very prominent display problems
4574588 non pro macbook owners are experiencing a different display problem where the screen begins to flicker while unlike the macbook pro the display image seems to be just fine the backlighting mechanism appears to get in a state where it flickers between low and high brightness about 10 15 times per second
4574589 still its only just a rumour for now with an analyst at ubs investment research maynard um claiming apple was initially going to announce it this year however its looking more likely to debut next year possibly at macworld in january
4574590 what can we expect from an apple logofied netbook chances are itll be around 8 9 inches in size white have about 4 gb of internal storage and cost around 400 500
4574591 it seems as if computer manufacturers the world over have been infected by the eee pc craze
4574592 usb analyst maynard um has questioned his sources in the industry and believes apple will upgrade and update its macbook by the end of this year furthermore he goes on to claim the next generation macbook will be a true subnotebook not like the macbook air
4574593 according to the analyst um the apple netbook was originally slated for a 2008 release but will be delayed to 2009
4574594 people should not expect to see a new ultraportable mac in september or possibly even during 2009 say analysts with piper jaffray while some groups have predicted an announcement during september when apple normally introduces new hardware and others have suggested a delay until early 2009 piper argues that the release of a new ultraportable is more likely a 2010 event the firm in fact argues that the closest apple may come to such a system in the near future is a revised version of the macbook air for 2009 designed to be even smaller than it is currently

4574599 just about everyone including me is saying that new macbooks will be landing in about a month unlike the past few updates this one by most accounts will be a total redesign
4574600 besides glass trackpads and a thinner full aluminum shell what other fun stuff could be thrown in
4574601 but why does apple have to stop there cant we have the best of both worlds why cant apple ship a laptop with two forms of storage
4574602 with twice the ssd space 128 gb costing roughly half the cost of the ssd option of january will apple take the plunge and give its users the option for an ssd powered macbook

4574607 hmm well now there has been a good deal of speculation about what the next new product transition cfo peter oppenheimer referred to will be all about
4574608 adding dedicated video chips would add some serious capabilities to the macbook and macbook pro
4574609 i was able to get mac os x 10 4 to run on a new os x 10 5 based intel macbook to make this work you need to own an intel imac or mac mini that runs on 10 4 as well as a usb hard drive heres how i got it working

4574613 if i think about my normal notebook usage patterns im pretty sure i could spend a good 80 90 of my time in the instant on environment and only boot into windows when i needed to do something specifically windows centric

4574740 obviously the american mer rovers spirit and opportunity that were put up by nasa enjoyed an extreme amount of success they were able to travel large distances well beyond their planned lifetimes but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
4574741 its quite a tense period for us in astrium and for the other companies involved in building exomars and for all the many many scientists who will depend on this mission
4574742 on the one hand we are moving ahead with a great momentum as youve seen this is not a paper project there is real engineering going on and we are on the verge of building the real hardware that will go on to the planet mars
4574743 but on the other hand we do have a real problem in order to complete the project further funding needs to be made available and it wont be until november that we are sure that that is in place
4574744 the uk will be working with its international partners to try to bring about a mission that has high impact and is affordable in a process of negotiation that will culminate in decisions at the ministerial in november 2008
4574745 i can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing i think its much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong i have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but im not absolutely sure of anything and in many things i dont know anything about such as whether it means anything to ask why were here and what the question might mean i might think about a little but if i cant figure it out then i go to something else but i dont have to know an answer i dont feel frightened by not knowing things by being lost in a mysterious universe without having any purpose which is the way it really is as far as i can tell possibly it doesnt frighten me

4574750 the championship is always on my mind but my real goal is to get a podium at the rest of the races
4574751 ive never seen the track before but these types of tracks seem to suit me i learned racing on go kart tracks so the tight stuff has come natural hayden won the last time out so i want to stay in front of him and leandro because its important to finish in front of them for the championship
4574752 now that we have some time in we can see the progress the riders are making at the mid ohio race we were really able to see just how far every rider has come there were a lot of crashes and red flags in the other classes that weekend but our boys put on a great race with no crashes and everyones lap times were within about 2 5 seconds the riders are maturing and were put on a great show for the fans
4574753 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4574754 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
4574755 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
4574756 all these people need care and thats why were here to provide that care its just we have limited resources
4574757 we have to get a handle on the patients we already have before we can start accepting new patients

4574779 this latest tragedy is another example of the grotesque barbarism of the military regime in burma and evidence that despite what the regime tells un envoys they continue to perpetrate crimes against humanity and a culture of impunity we call on the un to introduce specific benchmarks for progress such as the release of political prisoners and an end to the use of rape with deadlines and we urge mr gambari to send a clear tough message to the junta with the full weight of the un behind him
4574780 the un security council has described rape and sexual violence as a crime against humanity in resolution 1820 passed on 19 june this year we believe that the generals ruling burma should be brought to the international criminal court on charges of crimes against humanity

4574797 the outlook that i have for the second half of theyear and going into 2009 is that well see some alleviation ofthe inflation pressures and having oil and other commoditiescome down so strongly helps

4574837 as a cost cutting measure the game commission no longer mails a certificate and letter to successful bear hunters notifying them of their bears age
4574838 to maintain this valued customer service however we provide hunters with a certificate at the check station when their bear is processed and information about how and when they can find the age data which is determined by examining a tooth from the bear that is extracted as part of the check station processing on our website
4574839 while dmap permits may be used only on the specific property for which they are issued they do offer hunters additional antlerless deer hunting opportunities on public and private lands in wmus 1b 2f and 2g

4574847 in the cheerleading injury cases i have been involved with the common theme is that all of the coaches were not aacca safety certified when the injury occurred
4574848 it is incumbent upon state associations and if not state associations local school boards to require aacca safety training for their coaches in order to help protect their student athletes

4574853 mother jones conducted a review of lobbying disclosure forms and publicly available information at opensecrets org and legistorm com the records show that since the keating five scandal which by mccains own account turned the arizona senator into a crusader for reform at least 20 mccain staffers working for mccains personal senate office or for one of the committees he has chaired either came to mccains employ from a lobby shop or joined one after leaving the congressional payroll
4574854 craig holman the governmental affairs lobbyist for public citizen a consumer advocacy organization said mr scheunemanns dual role sometimes advising mr mccain as a candidate and sometimes advising private clients on their interactions with him as a senator raised potential red flags this is a serious revolving door problem a person who keeps fluctuating between being a lobbyist and advising candidates mr holman said
4574855 mr scheunemanns foreign clients arent controversial but his political and ideological relationship with sen mccain has blurred the lines between his roles as lobbyist and aide in 2000 mr scheunemann was an adviser in sen mccains unsuccessful bid for the republican nomination after sen mccain was defeated mr scheunemann started orion strategies in 2001 orion quickly signed contracts with romania and latvia worth a combined 240 000 to help them win nato admission contracts with georgia macedonia and taiwan followed like romania and latvia they are all u s allies

4574858 reiterated that he was following the money trail not the legislative actions taken by members of congress
4574859 we stop when we find out where the money went
4574860 theres strong evidence that there was significant wrongdoing but im not a judge or jury
4574861 i will not investigate members of congress because im a chairman of the indian affairs committee this was brought to our this whole thing started was brought to us attention by some disgruntled tribal council members in a small tribe in louisiana and we took it as far as we thought was our responsibility which is where the money ends up
4574862 in an interview with the washington post norquist denied that atr was used to conceal the source of funds sent to his and abramoffs old friend former christian coalition chief ralph reed and others but norquist and reed never have been called to testify under oath
4574863 the mccain campaign has long been concerned about whether conservative christian voters would fall in line this fall but last week ralph reed the first executive editor of the christian coalition and an unsuccessful 2006 candidate for georgia lieutenant governor invited well heeled folks to a very special event that means a fundraiser for mccain in downtown atlanta on august 18 reed whose campaign was torpedoed by his affiliation with disgraced lobbyist jack abramoff noted hes also agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team the atlanta journal constitution reported

4574879 good morning everyone we want to welcome you to this mornings press conference obviously you pretty much know what its all about well go ahead and introduce our folks ryan newman tony stewart and general manager of haas cnc racing joe custer
4574880 tony its pretty obvious why were all here today its capped off a month long bit of announcements but today another important piece of the puzzle at stewart haas
4574881 we were joking about it before we came over here this is the best kept secret im like are you kidding me i dont know that anything ive done in the last eight months has been a secret
4574882 so were just more excited to be able to let everybody else know
4574883 it keeps giving us a greater depth of people that we have as an option now to get over to the race team and add to the people that we have right now it makes this team even stronger than what it was a couple weeks ago already
4574884 ryan this brings together two indiana natives two guys with a lot of deep usac roots why make the decision to move to stewart haas next year
4574885 just a great opportunity i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint ive seen the success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done at other venues i just look forward to the opportunity
4574886 hes a hard nose racer become a good friend as an opposing competitor so it says a lot about that i just look forward to the experience hopefully our main goal is that we both achieve our goals and thats winning championships and both being in the chase
4574887 finally joe custer general manager of the team joe youve seen this team grow a lot in the last month talk about this latest development to the operation
4574888 its overwhelming in ways you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable we welcome ryan of course haas automation general motors all the supporters of our efforts key players in this were thrilled tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it to have ryan part of it i mean what can we say the rocket man is on board
4574889 just to note tony of course is from columbus ind ryan is from south bend ind the two of these guys bring together a combined 57 usac wins and 45 sprint cup wins well make this easy and simple well open it up to the media
4574890 we only had to sedate him for about four straight days laughter at which point you have the subliminal messages you just replay over in a loop after four days of that i was really surprised it took really well woke up and seemed to think that the week went by really quick laughter
4574891 you know what i think the big thing talking to ryan and krissie these guys was just explaining to them how the organization was going to be
4574892 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions from day one
4574893 those were the questions that really impressed me the most with ryan it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to give him quality cars and equipment and people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4574894 id say the biggest reservation kind of happened back in daytona when we won that race
4574895 as far as answering the part about tony and my history from racing usac midgets silver crown cars he was id say two to three years ahead of me as far as where his curve was moving up getting to nascar and racing in what was the busch car national series i went to him for advice he actually i dont know if he remembers this he asked me to come out to an irp test when i was down at indy when he was racing one of his nationwide cars then just to come out and be a part of it as somebody that knew where i was and where i wanted to go where he was and where he was going hes always been a friend hes looked out for me that said a lot even back then
4574896 were all seeing effects of the economy from the sponsorship side obviously
4574897 were currently working on sponsors for ryans car we were hoping to have them done for today but we didnt get it done in time so hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4574898 but its just making sure that we put the right partners together when youre working with multiple sponsors its making sure that you have the continuity between the two to make sure it works for both parties it makes it a little harder and the process is a little harder to get the contract it is done
4574899 im not sure were down to fine details yet but were getting close
4574900 yeah without naming names there were an easy three other teams that made me offers on offer sheets
4574901 to answer the second part of the question it was mostly tony
4574902 when tonys situation came to light and those things became more public it was easier to understand those things for me
4574903 you know obviously getting to run both cars this week im excited about trying to help continue that streak with the nationwide side that team and at the same time maybe hopefully getting our first win of the season here this weekend
4574904 absolutely and i think if you look at the history of roger penske and roger didnt have the ultimate stats that tony stewart does but roger was a racer you know that i think is extremely important to me to have somebody that understands the driving part of it the ownership part of it the teammate part of it the personnel part of it which is extremely important nowadays that meant a lot so yeah roger i still have a lot of respect for him and look forward to the rest of the season fulfilling my obligations but i definitely see the true racer and the potential future businessman in tony stewart
4574905 yeah weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4574906 you know its like i was telling somebody you dont have an option until you have at least two people
4574907 you know like i say its nice having options with the announcement today hopefully even more people are going to come out and want to be a part of the program because of ryan that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from hopefully
4574908 but it is coming together we are getting people hired we have commitments from people that were currently working on contracts right now that are some key people that we think are really going to be able to help us build this program
4574909 when roger and i shook hands saying i wasnt going to come back he knew from my standpoint that i was going to be the dedicated driver ive always been and i will do my best for myself most importantly but as well as the sponsors and alltel kodak people that have obviously been a big part of my career
4574910 ive focused just as much on driving the no 12 car as i will be next year driving the no 4 car you know like i said i still have a lot of respect for roger i believe roger still has a lot of respect for me well continue on as i said to roger its going to be business as usual that will end at the end of 08
4574911 well that wasnt as big a factor as just knowing that weve got somebody thats as passionate about our program as we are and somebody that we know is going to be competitive every week thats something that ryans already proved in his career in the cup series
4574912 you know obviously were working really hard to keep scott riggs driver of the no 66 haas cnc racing chevrolet in the top 35 right now and that would ensure that ryan doesnt have to do what he does best thats going out and getting front rows and poles and everything were trying to work really hard the rest of the season to accomplish that so we dont put that pressure on ryan thats something thats really big to the organization right now that we do everything we can to keep that 66 car in the top 35 in points let him worry about going out and racing not worrying about going out and qualifying the first five weeks
4574913 we sat down at the shop we talked about it signed the paperwork
4574914 the no 4 i know what that means to tony stewart i have numbers that mean more to me than the no 4 does but im here at stewart haas racing and i respect the no 4 and his decision he told me it was his first go kart number that means a lot to me because i have some of my first race cars with the no 43 on them which obviously are notorious here i look forward to representing that number with this team
4574915 we dont have senses of humor very dull quiet people both of us laughter
4574916 no the thing is theres going to be a lot of work involved in what were doing here but at the same time i mean weve got a teammate now and weve got an organization that realizes that
4574917 to see somebody like ryan and me around there each day i think will be something those guys will like ryan likes to fish i like to fish we both raise baby deer we have a lot of common interests i think this is something were both going to have a lot of fun doing
4574918 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything
4574919 but were going to have a lot of fun with this thats something that is important as hectic and busy and tedious as the schedule keeps getting each year it grows its not gotten easier its got harder every year to have somebody like ryan on board that you know youre going to have fun with that makes you look forward to going and having fun every day
4574920 matt borland i talked to him a couple times on and off hes still a great friend of mine obviously a super technical person has obviously a huge influence at stewart haas with respect to the race cars he was off the record a good person to talk to you know i appreciated his input
4574921 krissie newman obviously was my sounding board at the house she would elbow me somewhere between 12 and five in the morning at some points just to wake me up and talk about what i wasnt doing she was typically more stressed out and high strung about me making my decision and having a lot of input with that decision so she was very helpful to me no different than my parents who helped push me through college she helped push me through this situation and im very grateful for that
4574922 but yeah it made a difference but it wasnt the ultimate reason by any means
4574923 for me you know i can kind of speak on tonys behalf as much as he does mine its about us having crew chiefs that get along together and as a group between the drivers crew chiefs race engineers they have a common chemistry
4574924 so you know a lot of that is up to tony and the people at stewart haas to make those decisions obviously i want to have the input to have somebody i can personally get along with well address that situation as it comes
4574925 ive seen multi car organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4574926 were going to rely on ryans input as much as anybodys you know to make this decision
4574927 i dont think theres a lot of teams and organizations that have had a scenario where they get to go out at the same time and go after two crew chiefs so you know maybe this is something that will even be that much better for us
4574928 i want to have that influence i want to have that communication i want to be successful with tony and with the organization doing so its just a matter of the right time and the right place just like anything else in the world
4574929 this is the beginning of the process just like tony said there are going to be people that hopefully after tony announces im here will want to come and be part of the organization that is one of the first this is the concrete for the foundation lets say for building a perfect team a perfect organization
4574930 did you write that on paper so i can answer it laughter
4574931 im not sure i was coherent when i did it laughter
4574932 i signed it just recently we have had discussions for the last little bit but obviously i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4574933 i do not know the status of matt borlands contract agreement where he stands with the team that would be a good question for matt
4574934 going to the media center is a hell of a lot more fun now its a multi year agreement
4574935 i dont think weve ever been like that have we
4574936 obviously were not going to work against each other but were not in a position to work for each other either its the right time right place give and take type situation no different than it ever has been
4574937 its business as usual its just about respect out there weve always had respect for each other even though we drove for different teams now that were going to be on the same side next year that respect wont change it will still be there
4574938 im contracted and fulfilling my contract with penske racing to do what ive been contracted to do for the rest of the year and thats drive the no 12 alltel dodge try to get in victory lane win races do all those things
4574939 as far as previous ownership i think theres only one person that im aware of we both drove for that was steve chrisman that was in usac sprint car
4574940 he drove all that stuff after i tore it all up and had gone to another team he got to drive all the bent stuff laughter
4574941 yeah the chevrolet part of it im excited about obviously tony is super excited about it its a new deal for me i look forward to putting the chevrolet in victory lane
4574942 apparently set up outside of a construction site in downtown denver co
4574943 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4574944 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4574945 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4574946 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4574947 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4574948 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4574949 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4574950 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4574951 it was close this week he started precautionary training on tuesday these thigh strains are fairly minor injuries but they can become major injuries if they do not heal up properly
4574952 he will be fit at the start of next week to join us in training
4574953 i have not got the energy and the strength to fight hamburg on my own i dont play for brazil or argentina but for a small footballing country our federation is frightened of hsv
4574954 we have the opportunity to make belgian football history and im sure it would have an extra special flavour if it happened against opponents of this stature lets hope we can stay in the tournament and add another chapter to this beautiful story
4574955 there seems to be quite a market for canadian adult content right now and of course there isnt a lot of supply
4574956 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4574957 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4574958 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4574959 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4574960 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4574961 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4574962 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4574963 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4574964 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4574965 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4574966 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4574967 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4574968 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4574969 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4574970 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4574971 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4574972 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4574973 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4574974 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4574975 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4574976 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4574977 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4574978 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4574979 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4574982 i love to smoke i want to smoke but for now i choose not to smoke
4574983 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4574984 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4574985 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4574986 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4574987 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4574988 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4574989 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4574990 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4574991 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4574992 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4574993 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4574994 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4574995 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4574996 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4574997 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4574998 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4575006 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4575007 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4575008 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4575009 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4575010 i and everyone else at blizzard share the frustration and disappointment that many of you have expressed as a result of this process well do what it takes to avoid this type of situation in the future

4575012 leaders of the critical care neurology and transplantation communities need to jointly draft practice guidelines for organ donation after circulatory death that establish acceptable boundaries of practice
4575013 these boundaries should be based on scientific data and accepted principles and should be demarcated conservatively to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the transplantation enterprise

4575024 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4575025 i think that choice and gay rights are personal things particularly if you are a conservative the government should get out of the bedroom

4575095 these problems need to be looked into the ministry can create awareness provide information and counsel on how to prevent chronic diseases it is the people who need to have a behaviourial change and turn what we say into action
4575096 i will announce the recommendations made by the task force once the report is submitted
4575097 mechanisms to ensure adequate recognition of womens issues in budgetary processes

4575146 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4575147 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
4575148 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
4575149 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4575150 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4575151 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
4575152 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again

4575156 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4575157 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4575158 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything

4575322 angela merkels auftritt gestern in sotschi entsprach ganz ihrem blichen stil bei internationalen auftritten unaufgeregt im ton klar in der sache schuldzuweisungen hat sie bewusst gleichm ig auf russland und georgien verteilt ohne den neben ihr stehenden medwedew in der ffentlichkeit zu schonen auch das qualifiziert sie als halbwegs glaubhafte maklerin in der heimat kann sie manchmal nerven mit ihrer art sich blo nie festzulegen sondern immer sch n die moderatorin zu spielen auf der weltb hne kann das durchaus erfolgreich sein
4575323 gut beraten ist die kanzlerin sich weder von moskau noch von tiflis vereinnahmen zu lassen denn beide seiten f hren nach dem ende der kampfhandlungen eine hitzige propagandaschlacht ein erneuter beleg f r die arroganz der politiker die das leid tausender menschen missbrauchen um ihre interessengegens tze auszutragen
4575324 diesmal will angela merkel offenbar mit beharrlichkeit vorankommen sie hat genug realit tssinn um sarkozys traumt nzerischen plan einer eu friedenstruppe abzulehnen stattdessen beschr nkt sie sich darauf die einhaltung des sechs punkte plans zum waffenstillstand und den abzug russischer truppen aus dem kerngebiet georgiens einzufordern und vielleicht gelingt es der kanzlerin ja auch morgen in tiflis m igend auf georgiens pr sidenten saakaschwili einzuwirken das ist das maximum was momentan herauszuholen ist
4575325 merkel ist ihrer linie treu geblieben hat sich nicht gescheut auch ffentlich den einsatz russischer truppen in georgien teilweise
4575326 medwedew der hoffnungstr ger des westens zeigt sich als hardliner
4575327 politisch wie medial wird im zusammenhang mit dem georgien konflikt wieder der kalte krieg hervorgezaubert doch so einfach wie zu zeiten zweier machtbl cke mit klaren feindbildern ist die situation derzeit nicht abschottung verteufelung und aufr stung taugen nicht mehr zur konfliktl sung wenn aus feinden partner werden sollen und m ssen sind konsequenz und fingerspitzengef hl angesagt zwei tugenden die kanzlerin merkel auszeichnen angesichts der tatsache dass sie beim bukarester nato gipfel gegen eine sofortige aufnahme georgiens in das milit rb ndnis gestimmt hatte konnte sie beim treffen mit russlands pr sident medwedew klare forderungen stellen ohne gleich eine diplomatische eiszeit auszul sen

4575337 the injunction is allowing us to review the research that they have and see if there is any validity to their findings and take corrective action if any is even necessary
4575338 i send my condolences to the martyrs of the lebanese army and the citizens killed in the tripoli bombing this crime must be a motivation for all of us to come out of tension to cooperation to uplift our country
4575339 two years on the magnitude of the war the extent of the aggression the danger the huge military and security capabilities used by the enemy the extent of the regional and international collusion become clearer on the other hand the steadfastness the challenge taken by the resistance the people and the army to confront the war and the collusion confirm day after day that what had taken place in the july war projects the magnitude of the potential energy in lebanon and the nation two years on it becomes more evident that what happened in this war was a real miracle and a a divine victory
4575340 and will only lead to more failures and more fear for the israelis themselves
4575341 and as for you and your threats you can go to hell
4575342 there has been an israeli uproar about the reinforcement of hezbollahs strength there has been talk of sophisticated arms and an air defense system and threats if hezbollah uses this kind of system no one can expect me to stand up and say whether we possess new weapons or we dont this is part of directing the battle of liberation and resistance against this enemy
4575343 for instance the israeli army did not know that the resistance had land to sea missiles or the magnitude of its anti tanks missiles
4575344 the results of the war are evident even today in both the military and political fields in israel
4575345 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
4575346 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those who accept that washington entangles them in adventures miscalculated wars and dead end confrontation in the end the us administration will abandon them because its interests are above anything else just as they did to their allies in lebanon
4575347 ehud barak admits that the reason for losing the war was a lack of military experience so who is there left in israel with military experience if not all those failed generals those who stand against us today are the same failures who have already suffered blows from us before is it barak or ashkenazi who failed against the resistance as head of the northern command israeli newspapers have said that pm ehud olmert died two years ago in lebanon and will be brought to political burial in two months
4575348 this september we will see the end of israeli prime minister olmerts rule i remember baraks speeches back when he was the enemys prime minister in 2000 need i remind him that he set the date of the withdrawal from lebanon in july and we forced him to pull out in may
4575349 i tell the zionists we dont fear you say whatever you want and do whatever you want we know that you are planning new assassinations of resistance leaders but this will not make us retreat
4575350 if you the zionists are thinking of attacking lebanon i promise great surprises that could alter the fate of the war and the region god willing i said that in order to prevent a war israel must understand that any war on lebanon will have a very high price
4575351 the war has also has continuing repercussions at the regional level for the project of the new middle east promoted by the us has been put on hold and us secretary of state condoleezza rice is no longer raising this matter this project would have led to the division of lebanon and the arab world also israel is still confused in its dealings with palestinians in the gaza strip and is also negotiating with syria and seeking to disengage damascus from iran israel is terrorized by the iranian islamic republic and is hesitant whether to attack or not the percentage of voters in iraqi elections does not negate the high percentage supporting resistance because the iraqis want to rescue their countrys military and democracy
4575352 the united states and israel tried to split the lebanese along sectarian lines and to describe hezbollah as a terrorist group in order to weaken it during the 33 day war they wanted to tear us apart they wanted to use war to isolate us one country after the other one people after the other one sect after the other and one party after the other when we are divided they will win and we will be defeated the most serious accusation was the sectarian issue they told the christians that the fighting was with a muslim group and that it has nothing to do with you they told sunni muslims that the fighting was with a shiite group and was targeting the shiite project in the region
4575353 the disarmament of the resistance is a stated israeli goal it is not a secret i say to the israelis that their pressure will not lead to any result
4575354 the resistance is a solid project based on solid pillars a few angry speeches cannot change anything in the scene all this chaos is useless and the resistance is much stronger let us put aside all that provokes the street and instead deal positively with this new phase if we unite and cooperate and respect the ministerial statement israel cannot achieve anything against lebanon
4575355 that we hope will be the foundation of new ties
4575356 we insist now more than anytime before on the need to discuss and come up with a defense strategy for lebanon so that we all know how we can defend our country
4575357 coming up with a national strategy to rebuild the lebanese state and this is not an invitation to change the taif agreement as well as a strategy to settle the deep rooted economic and social problems are two crucial items to be discussed
4575358 will lead to a total collapse of the lebanese economy
4575359 with this second commemoration lebanese detainees in israel have been released and are now back in lebanon i will hold a press conference to comment on the issue of the detainees in lebanon including the four generals the missing in lebanon and syria and there will also be dna tests to identify the corpses of martyrs dalal mughrabi and yehya skaff and others
4575360 we are no aliens to beirut we are an integral part of the capital and we wish all the best to beirut and its residents we salute beirut mount lebanon and the north of lebanon that is still bleeding we also salute the bekka south lebanon and dahiyeh we salute every village and family supporting the resistance i bow before all the martyrs of the resistance army and population especially the leader hajj imad moghniyeh i also salute our palestinian brethren who were our partners in the struggle against israel
4575361 this second commemoration reaffirms the possibility of continuing our victories we must overcome the problems of the past

4575542 i believe in allah in his angels his scriptures his prophets the day of judgment and in the fact that every thing good or bad in the world is pre destined by allah the exalted and in the resurrection after death
4575543 in the year of autas allahs messenger permitted a temporary marriage for three nights but he prohibited it afterwards
4575544 i had permitted you the temporary marriage of women but allah has prohibited you from that till the day of resurrection so if anyone has a woman by temporary marriage he should let her go and do not take back any of your gifts from them
4575545 temporary marriage can be for one day a night and even just a few hours
4575546 one who performs mutah temporary marriage once will attain the rank of imam hussain one who performs it twice will attain the rank of imam hassan one who performs it thrice will attain the rank of imam ali and one who performs it four times will attain my rank
4575547 god doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due
4575548 we did indeed offer the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to undertake it being afraid thereof but man undertook it he was indeed unjust and foolish
4575549 those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants and who strictly guard their prayers these will be the heirs
4575550 discharge the settlement to those who entrusted you and dont betray even the one who broke his promise
4575551 there is no faith for the one who has no trust and there is no religion for the one that does not fulfill his promises
4575552 signs of a hypocrite are three whenever he speaks he lies whenever he promises he breaks his promises and whenever he has been entrusted be betrays his trust even if he fasts and prays and even if he claims he is a muslim
4575553 when someone hears a discussion from a person who does not want his name to be released it is considered to be a private conversation it is a trust and even if he did not ask to be kept private
4575554 if you have four qualities you should not worry about what you missed in life to take care of the trust to take care of the truth to have good manners and to have modest and pure food
4575555 and those who respect their trusts and covenants and those who stand firm in their testimonies amd those who guard the sacredness of their worship such will be the honoured ones in the gardens of bliss
4575556 they have hearts and yet they do not understand similarly they have eyes yet they do not see and similarly they have ears and yet they do not hear they are just like cattle or rather more misguided
4575557 oh you who have faith n allah most high do not take such jews and christians as your friends and allies who themselves are friends and allies of each other and whoever amongst you turns to them with friendship and as an ally becomes verily one of them surely allah does not guide those who commit acts of dhulm injustice oppression wickedness

4575572 eerst meldde iemand verrast dat deze kermismiddag voor gehandicapten inderdaad officieel is aangekondigd
4575573 na weer wat heen en weer gepraat werden we verwezen naar de dame van de poffertjeskraam die zou van alles op de hoogte zijn dus wij met de hele groep richting poffertjes maar daar aangekomen bleek ook die dame van helemaal niets te weten veel gehandicapten zijn afgedropen
4575574 door allerhande omstandigheden komen veel attracties stukken later dan ik gewend was vijf exploitanten moeten vandaag zelfs nog hun zaak opbouwen dat levert in die zin problemen op dat ik dus cht pas op het allerlaatst de kleinvermaakzaken en de kanszaken kan laten aansluiten om een mooi geheel te krijgen
4575575 het is sowieso voor zowel exploitanten als kermismeesters een gek jaar qua data
4575576 met feestdagen begin mei die in n week vielen en eerdere kermissen die de ene keer op dinsdag de andere keer pas op woensdagavond afsluiten andere jaren hielden de jongens vaak een weekeinde over ook dat scheelde voor de opbouw van onze kermis dat grillige werkt uiteindelijk het hele kermisseizoen door maar t komt goed morgen gaat de wethouder om drie uur het startschot geven die datum en dat tijdstip daar kunnen we niet omheen of we die opening hoog in de lucht in de around the world gaan doen betwijfel ik zeer we hebben allebei niets op met attracties die de hoogte in gaan en deze enorme zweefmolen haalt al gauw de osse grote kerk in
4575577 je blijft hoe dan ook altijd afhankelijk van de weersomstandigheden en die waren tot nu toe op kermissen die er toe doen en dan met name op prime time niet altijd even florissant anderzijds bieden wij de exploitanten een relatief lage inschrijving natuurlijk gekoppeld aan de door de gemeente vastgestelde ritprijs en zijn onze secundaire faciliteiten optimaal met de parkeermogelijkheden bij onze sporthal de rusheuvel hebben we een geweldige slag gemaakt daarnaast betalen we als gemeente z lf de liftinstituut keuring omdat we de veiligheid van de osse burger willen waarborgen en die kosten niet wensen af te wimpelen op de exploitant en de feestavond die we voorafgaand aan de zeven dagen kermisplezier de exploitanten aanbieden wordt door hen erg gewaardeerd
4575578 afgelopen jaar behaalden we landelijk gezien de tweede plaats op de ranglijst van de nederlandse kermisbond
4575579 de kermisvoorwaarden voor 2009 zijn door b en w inmiddels bekrachtigd nee we kiezen niet voor een derde partij die een en ander voor haar rekening neemt dat leidt vaak niet tot betere kermissen maar wel tot hogere ritprijzen
4575580 zelfs draaimolen en autoscooter worden meer en meer opgezadeld met hogere kosten door strengere keuringseisen en kiezen voor grotere plaatsen
4575581 je kunt sc nes zien van het collosseum van het oude rome misschien gladiatoren of julius caesar of andere dingen
4575582 many renters are under the same economic duress as owners
4575583 we understand why members of congress would want to put more goodies in homeowners baskets
4575584 materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial portion of consumers obtaining credit from or through
4575585 ridiculous it totally fails to distinguish between areas where prices are rising or relatively stable and other neighborhoods or communities where they are not
4575586 sound underwriting has nothing to do with geography it is based on the income and qualifications of the applicant and the valuation of the property by a professional appraiser
4575587 have their heaviest impacts on areas with high proportions of minority groups and people with moderate incomes who bought houses
4575588 people cant buy there because they need more cash upfront the houses dont sell and prices go down
4575589 i think that this history is irreal racism where pleaaaaseeee its an affectionate gesture
4575590 hello from spain this is so ridiculous its not offensive at all the ad its incredible that a country which obviously has a much more racist history like the us thinks we are racist because of such a thing your attitude reminds me of al qaedas reaction to mahomas pictures published in a danish newspaper some years ago ridiculous
4575591 we have a responsibility to educate our staff and i think we have been very thorough with that but we are doing it all over again
4575592 do i believe there are bad apples in that those people did something wrong absolutely
4575593 the question is why are the residents developing bedsores that is significant why are people falling what is being done to prevent them from falling
4575594 what we are doing now is documenting that intervention better
4575595 all i was doing was just trying to cut my monthly payment not increase anybodys risk
4575596 here we have our federal and state governments trying to help out people who are facing big payment increases and weve got lenders refusing to cooperate even when it makes sense for everyone involved
4575597 every day now and its so counterproductive all the articles you read quote the bank executives saying contact us we want to work with you then they turn around and pull stuff like this
4575598 the reports we hear are that lenders are extremely reluctant to do so
4575599 re what do you put in your childs lunchbox does it all need to be room temp stuff how about applesauce pb amp marshmallow
4575600 prefiro esperar at antes da viagem para ter uma defini o concreta do departamento m dico e assim escalar a equipe que ir entrar em campo

4575606 a luta com o cubano foi uma situa o decisiva ganharia vaga pra semifinal e enfrentaria um advers rio que eu conhe o um pouco mais
4575607 dei umas bobeiras que n o podia ter dado n o venho s por estar na competi o venho por um resultado mas claro que chegar aqui foi muito bom
4575608 isso talvez seja o ponto que a gente precise trabalhar um pouco melhor a parte emocional psicol gica dos nossos atletas n s temos uma psic loga adriana lacerda mas ela n o veio para a olimp ada a gente precisa de uma perman ncia maior dela junto com a equipe o tempo inteiro para se aprofundar
4575609 em termos t cnicos o reconhecimento do nosso jud mundial n o vejo que possa ter havido falha na parte t cnica h muitas reas de atua o no nosso esporte e uma delas a psicologia a gente lida com confronto direto contato f sico ass dio da m dia ent o isso pode ser trabalhado melhor
4575610 uma equipe com tr s campe es mundiais sem chegar em uma final algo que frustra a forma que aconteceu como a gente perdeu frustrante mas era importante manter o jud ganhando medalha e quebrar o jejum do feminino o maior destaque foi a ketleyn que marcou o nome na hist ria do esporte brasileiro no masculino apesar de n o ter conquistado medalha quem mostrou que um grande guerreiro com personalidade o eduardo emocionou todo mundo teve grande atua o e muita vontade de vencer
4575611 mesmo o jo o que n o chegou disputa de medalha n o decep o teve ano dif cil por conta das les es n o teve uma prepara o como os demais atletas numa olimp ada isso pesa no final n o tem milagre
4575612 a competi o foi at pica grandes pot ncias deixaram de ganhar medalha ningu m podia esperar a r ssia sem medalha nem o desempenho da fran a com o investimento que eles t m duas pratas e dois bronzes o esporte altamente competitivo e numa olimp ada medalha s o detalhes aquela finaliza o
4575613 o jud mais do que nunca globalizado voc treina com os advers rios todo mundo se exp e e isso est se universalizando neste primeiro ano do ciclo ol mpico a id ia investir mais no brasil quando traz equipes de fora mais atletas conhecem os outros judocas quando sai do pa s investe muito e poucos s os da sele o t m a possibilidade de treinar

4575663 for many years people in the free software world have dreamed of a day when gnu linux would replace windows on the desktop although the market share of gnu linux there is finally lifting figures range from 3 to 11 according to the sector it seems unlikely that gnu linux will ever take over the desktop from windows but that does not mean that windows will maintain its dominance there simply that the future is more complex than the monoculture we have seen and suffered for nearly two decades

4575667 we hope that we are pushing the envelope to really rethink nursing homes
4575668 thats a more important activity for some residents than anything we could provide
4575669 it is like this is where i am supposed to be
4575670 shes in the lead now but it wont be for long
4575671 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
4575672 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
4575673 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
4575674 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4575675 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
4575676 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
4575677 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
4575678 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
4575679 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
4575680 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
4575681 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
4575682 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
4575683 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
4575684 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
4575685 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
4575686 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
4575687 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
4575688 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
4575689 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
4575690 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
4575691 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
4575692 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
4575693 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
4575694 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
4575695 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
4575696 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
4575697 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
4575698 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
4575699 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these re russia invades province of georgia after georgia attacks russians videos
4575700 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4575701 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4575702 information is no longer a staff function but an operational one it is deadly as well as useful
4575703 russia is an aggressor we are a small democratic country please help us
4575704 if the russians stop hostilities now they will have redrawn the whole strategic situation in the caucasus to the detriment of the americans
4575705 no one will invest in georgia in oil pipelines in new ventures there now the game is over in the new version of the great game the russians can cash in
4575706 at the moment it appears that russia will have gotten positive benefits from the use of force across its border
4575707 for medvedev the outcome is a war thats been won its his personal victory
4575708 the image of medvedev is the biggest casualty we and the west were hoping that russia at last had a young liberal reforming leader now after these events he comes off looking like a tough guy and there is an impression that hes totally dependent on putin
4575709 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
4575710 while no one wants a return to cold war style confrontation moscows behavior poses a direct challenge to european and international order
4575711 a russia that has the means of force and is ready to use it spells a whole new situation
4575712 all neighboring countries will have to take this into account much depends on how russia behaves if it tries to dictate terms that will have a very negative effect but my impression is that russia was quite restrained and carefully calculated each move it seems likely that nato will be paralyzed
4575713 meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4575714 we saw them arriving in the capital south ossetia has become a symbol of a powerful russia a russia that seems to be expanding its territory
4575715 theres no gas no electricity no water in the city
4575716 its all because of our leadership its not our fault but were the ones who suffer
4575717 were expecting humanitarian help from tbilisi like bread and sugar
4575718 the people who sit in their armchairs maybe they want it but we dont want it
4575719 we expect the united states to adopt a responsible approach it is especially important to refrain from any steps that could directly or indirectly be taken by the georgian leadership as encouragement of its revanchist ambitions and prompt a repeated tragic scenario

4575721 most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place theyre capable of anything
4575722 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
4575723 our rescue boats have a speed of 30 to 40 knots so the need for simulator training is increasing the fact that we can also practice situations where helicopters and other vessels are involved makes this a really good investment
4575724 we cover a large international market but this delivery is very important we know that the nssr has unique competence within its field and such professional clients are valuable to us a training centre in our local community focusing on maritime safety and knowledge is something we consider a great asset
4575725 the combined ability of transas and pt multiintegra to add local value is a main reason why we were awarded the contracts
4575726 this is not the first time that the indonesian ministry of transportations education training agency eta has installed a navigation simulator in their institution to fulfil stcw95
4575727 kongsberg maritime is proud to be awarded such a high profile bridge simulator contract for the prestigious amc project and we welcome the opportunity to share our vast simulation experience and knowledge with the college
4575728 we are highly motivated and excited to be a part of the continuing amc presence in the maritime training and research environment and we look forward to working together and further developing our relationship
4575729 the economic situation competition from other countries make it impossible to keep the plant up and running
4575730 its been whispered its very unfortunate just like when drexel closed there will be opportunities through mcdowell tech for retraining and linking the workers with new employment
4575731 well make sure they get their unemployment benefits just as soon as they are eligible
4575732 we wont be able at this time to answer questions about how much they can get in unemployment benefits
4575733 because the plant wont be closing until the next quarter so we cant speculate at this point
4575734 the closing of the shelters were not intended to put people on the streets we are concerned about the wellbeing of all the people
4575735 accordingly ms davis prescribing physician was deprived of the ability to fully assess the risks when making the decision to prescribe the drugs due to the defendants deficient and inadequate warning
4575736 would not have suffered her adverse reaction and its subsequent complications
4575737 for the purpose of increasing sales and enhancing its profits
4575738 defendants conduct was wanton and willful and displayed a conscious disregard for the safety of the public and particularly of ms davis entitling her to exemplary damages

4575741 we need to double the number of councillors we have over the next few years we need to find the next generation of green councillors
4575742 where we are established like liverpool bristol cambridge and solihull we need our council groups to grow and set the agenda we need to give green councillors the help to succeed
4575743 rural successes in stroud and st ives need to be repeated
4575744 many cities like newcastle durham and cardiff could easily have green councillors and green mps we need people to join and help us win elections to these councils
4575745 we need new members to join and we need to actively invite community activists to join the green party is the natural home for anyone who stands up for their local community local jobs and services thats what the green party is all about
4575746 often the best way to fight for your local community is to get elected and hit your opponents where it hurts in the ballot box
4575747 we will definitely have to go a lot faster in the final i think another two seconds off that would get us a medal but we have it in us whether we do it or not is the question weve all got the potential to do it weve just got to refocus and come back energised
4575748 a few of the guys like gerhard and cameron havent swum for a couple of days so that was their first swim since monday i think
4575749 the last few days of the olympics swimming is probably the easiest time to win a medal because people are tired and they want to go home so now is the time weve got to dig deep and let all that hard training pay dividends
4575750 i think we all tried hard weve had a good meet the girls have done personal best times in their races so we were going out there to have fun and enjoy it and unfortunately this time we fell a bit short and we didnt make it through to the final
4575751 i think the teams been lacking a bit in spirit so we just went out there and tried to make ourselves feel like a team and enjoy it swimming is a very individual sport as it is and we had such a big team it would have been nice if we all just felt a little bit closer and supported each other a little better

4575755 unfortunately today we are looking evil in the eye it is very strong very nasty and very dangerous

4575780 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the champions league
4575781 we were pleased with the wacas reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment
4575782 we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january

4575798 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4575799 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4575800 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4575801 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4575802 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4575803 resulta una incoherencia pensar en montar un multimedios oficialista con un costo superior al mill n de d lares sin saber cu nto costar gestionarlo mensualmente cuando el propio gobernador hermes binner dice que las cuentas de la provincia est n en peligro y el gobierno no es capaz de articular una oferta en tiempo y forma para evitar el paro docente y dejar a los ni os de la provincia otra vez sin clases
4575804 una cadena provincial oficial de radio y televisi n es una iniciativa innecesaria fuera de lugar y a destiempo ya que esta provincia tiene una larga tradici n de apertura y pluralismo a trav s de sus medios de comunicaci n independientes tanto en radios diarios canales abiertos y de cable y en los ltimos tiempos en portales de internet donde toda la informaci n que tiene que ver con la gesti n de gobierno tiene una amplia cobertura sin importar el color pol tico de quien ocupe la gobernaci n o las administraciones municipales o comunales
4575805 la experiencia en la argentina de medios estatales nos remite a un dato indubitable son muy poco mirados por la gente y suelen costarle muy caro a los contribuyentes en este caso a los santafesinos

4575810 in the last several years real estate agents have been trained to market through creative ways with online content

4575816 russia was waiting for a propitious moment to punish georgia
4575817 south ossetia and abkhazia have been russias toeholds in the region and russia has been unhappy for quite some time with georgias leaning toward the eu and america
4575818 even if the state of war ends soon the process whereby russia attempts to reintegrate parts of the former russian soviet empire will probably not end in the foreseeable future
4575819 russia has quite a bit of leverage to do so and the everyday people whose lives will be affected will have little influence on how it goes
4575820 just as it would be threatening to the united states if a country along our border were to join an alliance that is perceived as antagonistic to the u s but the invasion into georgia is hard to justify

4575826 arrow 3 system an advanced model of an arrow interception missile would help israel intercept ballistic missiles in a much wider range than the current model
4575827 israel objected to the development of the sm 3 at the expense of the us funding of the new arrow program as the defense ministry prefers to provide work to israeli industries and because the cost of the new standard is estimated at 10 12 million per missile while the arrow 3 will only cost 1 5 2 million per unit
4575828 the program will be under american supervision and should it turn out that the development is being delayed or is failing to reach its objectives the resources will be shifted to the development of the sm 3

4575837 we will not allow the attention to be shifted from our cause
4575838 reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4575839 witnessing a recurrence of pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality
4575840 finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir

4575842 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
4575843 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
4575844 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
4575845 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
4575846 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
4575847 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
4575848 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
4575849 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
4575850 firing on unarmed civilians will alienate people further and serve the cause of separatists
4575851 just as the personal plural pronoun us does not take away from the individuality of its components you and i only if the term sindhi could be broadened to encompass all the people settled in the province regardless of their origins a purely ethnic usage of the term though acceptable in specific contexts will continue to divide its people and make it easy to exploit the differences by parties only concerned with their own benefits at the cost of a great loss to our province

4575858 according to minutes of a public commission meeting that occurred on nov 13 2006 tymchuck asked for a 15 minute recess to review the remodel proposal
4575859 when he came back from that recess the minutes say tymchuk supports the report as a thoughtful innovative document
4575860 tymchuk is a surrogate and a representative for gordon smith when hes not in oregon which is often

4575868 the sass patronised by rss and bajrang dal is trying to give shape to the long cherished concealed agenda of the sangh parivar to divide the state on regional and religious lines
4575869 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
4575870 credible inputs that thousands of sangh parivar activists from gujarat up mp and maharashtra have infiltrated into jammu and it is they who are planning and spearheading the protests there
4575871 those opposed to the amarnath land transfer were questioning jammu and kashmirs status as an integral part of the country
4575872 jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india whoever raises questions on this issue will have to pay for it
4575873 this is not a question of amarnath or a shrine alone they are saying it is okay that you have alloted land for vaishno devi in jammu but how can you allot land in kashmir
4575874 shyama prasad mookerjee during his struggle 55 years ago for cancelling the visa system for those visiting the state had promised people that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life we seem to have turned a full circle today
4575875 excessive use of force by indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
4575876 security forces and policemen are guarding the streets and a curfew has been imposed in the entire valley
4575877 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
4575878 fruits are getting rotten as people in jammu are blocking our trucks
4575879 from children to old men all are suffering for the past one month
4575880 we will not leave any stone unturned to resolve the issue
4575881 an all party delegation has appealed to all the sections of people in kashmir to maintain peace and harmony
4575882 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
4575883 the oic hopes that all segments of society in germany and other parts of europe will come out strongly against the holding of such a conference and reject the proponents of hatred and racism
4575884 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
4575885 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4575886 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
4575887 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
4575888 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam
4575889 i pulled myself up to my windowsill and peered into the stars imagining they were the one thousand and one eyes of al lah when he looked at me what did he see inferiority a shrunken soul a light that shone more feebly than that of a man or did he see what i felt a bright burning like the bush hed inhabited the day hed revealed himself to moses
4575890 this was the beginning of something new something terrible soon i would be lying on my bed beneath him squashed like a scarab beetle flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me he would not want to hurt me but how could he help it its always painful the first time
4575891 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
4575892 muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal i assume he did all the things a man does he had 12 wives im sure he had sex with them
4575893 im glad the story has come out because now any publisher who takes it on will do so with eyes wide open im hoping to find someone who is as passionate as i am and my agent is
4575894 they behaved as any publisher in the west should do and upheld freedom of publication and freedom of speech they stuck by their guns at not inconsiderable risk to their senior executives these are the principles we should live and die by
4575895 the main problem for most is that they fall in between what consumers are looking for

4575910 you can create different tracking codes for different portions of your list and send them out so you know which segment is most responsive
4575911 and make sure subscribers know exactly what they have chosen it should be clearly spelled out in their preferences

4575934 two sources say apple will likely issue a software update by the end of september if not by the end of this month to resolve the issues
4575935 apple and infineon are currently testing the fix which will be included in a broader update of the iphones software part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network
4575936 apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires
4575937 if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available
4575938 the most likely cause of the 3g problems is defective adjustments between the antenna and an amplifier that captures very weak signals from the antenna
4575939 this could lead to poor 3g connectivity and slower data speeds

4576006 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia

4576008 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4576009 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4576010 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4576011 the operating theory behind the war on terror which involves massive us intervention in central asia to control vital resources fragment russia and surround manufacturing giant china
4576012 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4576013 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4576014 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4576015 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4576016 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4576017 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4576023 esos oficiales retirados son las viudas que viven llorando a la fuerza armada que ellos vivieron una fuerza armada en la que el amante de un presidente fue uniformada de general y cosas de ese tipo
4576024 ellos a oran eso que ya no existe porque nuestros generales y oficiales as como los componentes de la fuerza armada son personas que est n concientes de su verdadera misi n y tienen la dignidad por delante ellos prefer an llamar comandante en jefe a amantes del presidente y a borrachos por eso hay que revisar la historia reciente de los presidentes de este pa s para que veamos a qui n rend an pleites a los comandantes que ahora critican la nueva ley

4576161 the timing of the announcement by fda raises eyebrows considering the california legislature is about to vote on a measure to remove the toxic chemical from some childrens products bpa has been linked to altered brain development behavioral changes and prostate problems in animals and should not be used in any consumer products that could potentially leach into food and liquids especially in products young children use every single day
4576162 we have long since lost faith in fdas ability to be an impartial authority on bpas safety time and again fda has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical
4576163 it appears that congress has lost considerable faith in fda on this matter too

4576173 are there not in reality underlying universal principles with reference to which all issues must be resolved whether the society be simple or complex in its mechanical organization it seems to me we could relieve ourselves of most of the bewilderment which so unsettles and distracts us by subjecting each situation to the simple test of right and wrong right and wrong as moral principles do not change they are applicable and reliable determinants whether the situations with which we deal are simple or complicated there is always a right and wrong to every question which requires our solution
4576174 i believe that governments were instituted of god for the benefit of man and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them both in making laws and administering them for the good and safety of society
4576175 i believe that no government can exist in peace except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience the right and control of property and the protection of life
4576176 i believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside which protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments and that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected and should be punished accordingly and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest at the same time however holding sacred the freedom of conscience
4576177 rights are not gifts from one man to another nor from one class of men to another it is impossible t discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin of man it consequently follows that rights appertain to man in right of his existence and must therefore be equal to every man
4576178 can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god that they are not to be violated but with his wrath
4576179 life liberty and property do not exist because men have made laws on the contrary it was the fact that life liberty and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place
4576180 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
4576181 we the people do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america
4576182 if men were angels no government would be necessary if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary
4576183 each of us has a natural right from god to defend his person his liberty and his property these are the three basic requirements of life and the preservation of any one of them is completely dependent upon the preservation of the other two for what are our faculties but the extension of our individuality and what is property but and extension of our faculties
4576184 if every person has the right to defend even by force his person his liberty and his property then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly thus the principle of collective right its reason for existing its lawfulness is based on individual right
4576185 for nobody can transfer to another more power than he has in himself and nobody has an absolute arbitrary power over himself or over any other to destroy his own life or take away the life of property of another
4576186 that the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life liberty and property and when the government assumes other functions it is usurpation and oppression
4576187 the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the states of created beings capable of laws where there is no law there is no freedom for liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others which cannot be where there is no law and is not as we are told a liberty for every man to do what he lists for who could be free when every other mans humour might domineer over him but a liberty to dispose and order freely as he lists his person actions possessions and his whole property within the allowance of those laws under which he is and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow his own
4576188 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
4576189 the basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government but the constitution which at any time exists until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government
4576190 we rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government
4576191 sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself can he then be trusted with the government of others or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him let history answer this question
4576192 the way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one but to divide it among the many distributing to every one exactly the functions he is competent to let the national government be entrusted with the defense of the nation and its foreign and federal relations the state governments with the civil rights law police and administration of what concerns the state generally the counties with the local concerns of the counties and each ward direct the interests within itself it is by dividing and subdividing these republics from the great national one down through all its subordinations until it ends in the administration of every mans farm by himself by placing under every one what his own eye may superintend that all will be done for the best what has destroyed liberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed under the sun the generalizing and concentrating all cares and powers into one body
4576193 though the people support the government the government should not support the people
4576194 nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes have been forced to send it in
4576195 when a portion of wealth is tranferred from the person who owns it without his consent and without compensation and whether by force or by fraud to anyone who does not own it then i say that property is violated that an act of plunder is committed
4576196 to introduce into society a greater evil than this the conversion of the law into an instrument of plunder
4576197 assume for example that we were farmers and that we received a letter from the government telling us that we were going to get a thousand dollars this year for plowed up acreage
4576198 neither you nor i nor would 99 percent of the farmers walk up and ring a mans doorbell hold out a hand and say give me what youve earned even though i have not we simply wouldnt do it because we would be facing directly the violation of a moral law thou shalt not steal in short we would be held accountable for our actions
4576199 created more than 50 of all the worlds products and possessions in the short span of 160 years the only imperfection in the system is the imperfection in man himself
4576200 no historian of the future will ever be able to prove that the ideas of individual liberty practiced in the united states of america were a failure he may be able to prove that we were not yet worthy of them the choice is ours
4576201 this government never of itself furthered any enterprise but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way it does not educate the character inherent in the american people has done all that has been accomplished and it would have done somewhat more if the governmment had not sometimes go in its way for government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone and as has been said when it is most expedient the governed are most let alone by it
4576202 with all these blessings what more is necessary to make us a happy and prosperous people still one thing more fellow citizens a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned
4576203 england was killed by an idea the idea that the weak indolent and profligate must be supported by the strong industrious and frugal to the degree that tax consumers will have a living standard comparable to that of taxpayers the idea that government exists for the purpose of plundering those who work to give the product of their labor to those who do not work the economic and social cannibalism produced by this communist socialist idea will destroy any society which adopts it and clings to it as a basic principle any society
4576204 the natural effort of every individual to better his own condition when suffered to exert itself with freedom and security is so powerful a principle that it is alone and without any assistance not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumbers its operations though the effect of these obstructions is always more or less either to encroach upon its freedom or to diminish its security
4576205 most of the major ills of the world have been caused by well meaning people who ignored the principle of individual freedom except as applied to themselves and who were obsessed with fanatical zeal to improve the lot of mankind in the mass through some pet formula of their own the harm done by ordinary criminals murderes gangsters and thieves is negligible in comparison with the agony inflicted upon human beings by the professional do gooders who attempt to set themselves up as gods on earth and who would ruthlessly force their views on all others with the abiding assurance that the end justifies the means
4576206 these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly tis dearness only that gives everything its value heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial and article as freedom should not be highly rated

4576289 we were satisfied walking away from nashville with a top 10 finish especially after all the hiccups we faced during the weekend our car was strong in the race but we had to battle some adversity that potentially kept us from a better finish it was a nice way though to bounce back from the bad luck weve been taking in lately
4576290 time to get dirty im really excited about the arca re max series going back to the dirt were going to have a good car and i honestly feel we can be in contention to win the allen crowe 100 i hope nothing stands in our way
4576291 thats pretty neat last year we came to springfield then went to some more asphalt tracks then came back to the dirt this year they are back to back and i think thats the way it should be both races will be good and competitive but i want to get through springfield first before thinking ahead to duquoin
4576292 its an award that every driver would like to win the award tests your talent and luck on several different types of track that the arca re max series competes on we were in contention last year but lost the battle with the improvement of our team this year i hope we can pull it off
4576293 nashville was full of ups and downs for the sheltra motorsports team and our marketing partners however with the good comes the bad and we were able to battle back and grab a top 10 finish no one on the team gave up and it showed with the finish at nashville it had been four races since we had a top 10 finish so we deserved it
4576294 its off to the dirt obviously patrick has a lot of reasons to be excited for the race this weekend were confident in the car that we are bringing and with the momentum we have from pocono and nashville we hope that we can secure our first win sunday afternoon

4576328 ill be honest losing last years race after leading so many laps was pretty heartbreaking but that was last year and tomorrow we have a new opportunity a new race in front of us well go into the mile expecting a typical springfield track it tends to lay rubber and be pretty hard on tires fortunately weve had some experience with this type of track this year and i think were pretty prepared for whatever may come at us the entire tsr team has worked really hard to make sure were ready to go and i have a lot confidence in the car that theyve prepared for me tomorrows race will definitely be a good one and i think weve got a great shot of putting chevy in the winners circle again this year
4576329 i would love to end our day at the illinois state fairgrounds with a trip to victory lane in the chevy maxim the last time i raced at the mile i was able to win and i think were going to have just as much of an opportunity to do so again this weekend the past two weeks have been really busy for the tsr team but the guys have put in a lot of hours working to make sure weve been prepared for every race im looking forward to racing in springfield tomorrow well have to see how the track comes in and make sure we adjust as necessary to run up front

4576366 ea partners agreements generate two things for ea sales so it helps the top line and cash but the deals are low margin ea is trying to get its margins up to 20 25 percent and these deals negatively impact that these agreements make ea look more like a distributor than a developer of world class videogame titles its indicative of the fact that they are not able to develop enough of their own titles to meet their revenue and earnings goals that they need to fill in the gaps with these distribution deals if they had their own properties say like what activision has they wouldnt need these distribution deals in the past they havent but for some reason now theres a big push i can see that they want to leverage their marketing and distribution platform with other peoples content but from an investors perspective when youre dealing with operating margins and what not these deals hurt those margins it makes it a lot worse

4576381 we are aggressively attacking the factual errors in this book and making sure that everyone knows about the deeply offensive things corsi has said that will give readers of any political affiliation pause and ample reason to question the lies hes written
4576382 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and dick cheney get re elected four years ago this is his attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4576383 although we cannot speak about specific customers due to confidentiality agreements we have no indication of customer loss as a result of our pending agreement with ups

4576400 darrell said you gotta meet this guitar player hes phenomenal used to play with the kentucky colonels
4576401 hed just taken the capo off it the guitar and was starting to learn to play barre chords up and down the neck once he pulled the capo off he really got down to it he was bending strings all over the place and trying to make it sound like a steel guitar
4576402 we played seven nights a week there and a double shift on sunday we played from noon until six we took a couple hours off came back and played nine til two seven days a week we drove back and forth to palmdale which was about 80 miles so we were quite busy boys
4576403 gary was as adept at country as he was at anything else but he was on the edge of the new sounds and explored them all to find if there was another lucrative avenue other than just country music we were all enthused with the union of rock and country and i just thought it was a natural thing it was so smooth there wasnt even a notable segue
4576404 i had a rock n roll band and i had a country band including glen d hardin and james burton though i couldnt get them very often because they were working a whole bunch so i phased in gib and clarence and gene and wayne though glen d would still play piano and ben benay would maybe play rhythm with the country band or clarence might play with mike deasy it kinda went back and forth
4576405 clarence is playing a dobro and i never heard anybody that was any good but him that style was what he got out of his influences classical guitar and james burton
4576406 we wrote charts out clarence and gib would always play rhythm first and then clarence would go back and put lead on wayne also played rhythm and vern too i would use like eight rhythm guitars one would be a gibson one would be a martin etc and id set all four of them facing each other and put the mics on them then wed record and wed stack them i would have the guys switch guitars so you would have a different player and a different feel on the martin and the gibson but then clarence liked to flatpick that bubbly stuff on the dobro and wed either do that first and overdub the electric or wed do the electric first and then fill the holes in with the dobro clarence loved to play that thing
4576407 these residencies would often be longer than six weeks we would go and play and then wed come back and play again the nashville west was my favorite because we were there the longest and we just left everything set up it was a pretty lively scene there were a lot of clubs in town like the aces club which was after hours they had a house band musicians from the whole area would come everyone would sit in and afterwards wed have breakfast it was a real good time a camaraderie a lot of this was straight country but we were mixing in a lot more rock n roll at that point
4576408 i had a sony two track and i hooked it up partly to the sound system and partly to the microphones and recorded the whole night
4576409 we didnt really have any name when we played in bakersfield we were the happening gary paxton band so people would call me gary all the time or ask wheres gary we were called cajun gib amp gene on some occasions otherwise we were usually the reasons
4576410 friends would sit in with the group including glen d hardin on keyboards and steel guitarists sneaky pete kleinow and lloyd green gram parsons also sat in with the group occasionally
4576411 legend has it that word spread so quickly about this hot band with the amazing guitar player that several members of l a s fledgling country rock fraternity including nascent burrito brothers like gram parsons and sneaky pete kleinow made the pilgrimage to palmdale home of jack of diamonds
4576412 when we were working at the nashville west the byrds would come and sit in with us because they were studying country music and we were one of the hottest country rock bands in southern california at that time and they came to study us
4576413 yeah it seemed like clarence played a little loud he liked to do country and rock n roll equally
4576414 clarence used a fender vibrolux era model pictured right with an auxiliary speaker which was an altec voice of the theater a monster it was as loud as you could get with 30 watts
4576415 live clarence just cranked the amp all the way up to 10 we were all always loud loud for a country band we had people comment that we played country like a rock n roll band a little bit rough around the edges the older audience didnt care for us too much our audiences were always a lot younger 20s early 30s which was strange we had a following when we played the jack of diamonds on weekends 50 of our crowd was from l a folks that would drive up eddie dean tex williams glen campbell and some of the nashville guys like little jimmy dickens they all sat in waylon jennings played there though that wasnt a regular thing we had a guest maybe once every couple of months

4576422 and do the unthinkable get long the u s dollar versus the euro
4576423 i would stick your dollar where the sun dont shine
4576424 i really am amazed that people who are so well educated could be so ignorant to send out a newsletter saying how the weak dollar is looking up is very irresponsible
4576425 the u s dollar multi year down trend is over
4576426 since reaching an all time low against the major currencies in mid march the u s dollar has climbed 6 the currency has seen several larger temporary gains during its 38 slide since 2002 but this one could have legs
4576427 the dollars surge against the euro has prompted bank of america corp to tell its customers to exit trades betting on more gains
4576428 a bit premature the dollar will get much worse before it gets better
4576429 operation warrior wake up is about how local hawaiian businesses support the troops get through the everyday grind
4576430 so here we are all these years later and im sending coffee to the soldiers of the 14th cav regt the successors of the very men that stood fast and protected my own father all those years ago
4576431 last summer in june our goe hawaii group turned out to give an aloha greeting to members of 2nd sbct 25th inf div who were coming to the big island to pta to train and whom were traveling up saddle road in a convoy
4576432 as they passed us and our troops appreciation sign and many u s flags one soldier tossed me his own tropic lightning division shoulder patch and at that moment or shortly thereafter the idea began to gel that perhaps there was a way i could offer to support these u s army troops our own 2nd sbct 25th inf div soldiers based right here in hawaii
4576433 the patch went with me the day i decided to approach my own immediate neighbors here in the heart of americas only coffee country with the idea to start sending fresh roasted kona coffee which they themselves have grown and freely donated
4576434 they were amazingly receptive more than being receptive within days they had come thru with over 30 pounds of coffee which i quickly put in the mail to addresses that id been given by rear detachment commanders and it was on its way to iraq
4576435 it really means a lot to the soldiers in the squadron to have someone support them from state of hawaii since at one point we didnt even know if the stryker brigade was ever going back there
4576436 it is good to know that no matter what the political pressures were there are people from hawaii that care about the soldiers it is also good to have something shipped to you to remind you of home

4576458 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4576459 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4576460 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4576461 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4576462 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4576463 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4576464 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4576465 spore was very much inspired by many different types of sciences
4576466 we spent a lot of time meeting a lot of scientists very early on in developing this game to find out what areas would be interesting to bring into the game
4576467 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4576468 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time

4576470 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4576471 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed

4576473 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4576474 gods warriors is an investigation of religion at a time when religious activism is a signature cultural phenomenon of our times
4576475 this projects global scope is ideally suited for the skills of someone with as impressive of a journalistic pedigree as our own christiane amanpour
4576476 there are millions of people around the world who feel that their faith is being ignored pushed aside and they are certain they know how to make the world right
4576477 we cannot and should not ignore them and with this report weve tried to explain them
4576478 ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers
4576479 the tragedy besides our personal tragedy is that he was stopped in the middle of the way
4576480 and we can never know how the end of the path would have been
4576481 people have experienced extreme disappointment with secular culture and so there has developed this counter cultural protest
4576482 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4576483 ese discurso de que va a haber desabastecimiento y se va a incrementar la inflaci n luego de este ajuste de precios es un discurso de la canalla que pretende jugar con el hambre de nuestro pueblo o con la angustia que pudiera generar una situaci n de escasez de alimentos
4576484 hemos estado evaluando una adecuaci n de precios durante los ltimos dos a os con respecto a los costos de producci n es importante que se sepa que la pol tica de control de precios no es pol tica de congelaci n hemos adecuado todos los alimentos en la medida que los costos de producci n han afectado y este ltimo ajuste responde a que tienen componente de materia prima importada como es el caso del aceite la mayonesa y la salsa de tomate

4576497 the strong u s economy is just on the surface
4576498 there are problems of corruption emerging there is concern about whether chinas market economy will ever become a sound market economy
4576499 from the ancient time till now everybody wants to make more money
4576500 but from history we see only christians have a continuous nonstop creative spirit and the spirit for innovation
4576501 in the u s the spires of churches are more numerous than chinas banks and rice shops on a street near harvard square
4576502 i once stood and looked about me only to find that in three different directions there were three churches
4576503 when chinese become rich they buy houses or maybe they marry a second wife
4576504 he had a lot of wealth but he still lived simply and he used his wealth to bless a lot of other people
4576505 i fear wherever riches have increased the essence of religion has decreased
4576506 for religion must necessarily produce both industry and frugality and these cannot but produce riches but as riches increase so will pride anger and love of the world in all its branches
4576507 we are convinced that as an organization we might not come out clean on the bombing issue destruction is not the solution and anyone with a grievance should come to my office so that it will be addressed

4576515 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
4576516 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
4576517 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in the next stages
4576518 much in the gafcon documents is consonant with much of what we have sought to say and do and we need to look for the best ways of building bridges here
4576519 we did consider very seriously the possibility of a bishops and laity anglican congress or gathering in south africa half way between the last lambeth in 1998 and this one that proved extraordinarily difficult im very open to looking for larger scale anglican gatherings on the continent where the majority of anglicans actually are
4576520 we have not resolved the differences among us but have seen the deep need to maintain relationships even in the face of significant disagreement and discomfort
4576521 we are not talking about rights for the sake of the communion we are asking for sacrifice
4576522 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
4576523 i think this is not the last anglican conference but i do think it will be the last lambeth conference
4576524 the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide

4576600 janganlah kerusi leather empuk yang baru diperoleh melupakan anda dengan perjuangan asal
4576601 jangan kerusi bertanda adun atau ahli parlimen atau menteri atau exco menyebabkan diri tertipu sehingga terjebak dalam penggunaan kuasa secara salah perolehan harta secara salah
4576602 janganlah gelaran yb dan lain lain gelaran baru menyebabkan anda bertukar sifat dan kelakuan dari peramah dan berjiwa masyarakat kepada berjiwa syaitan yang angkuh dan sombong
4576603 janganlah pejabat baru yang canggih dan cantik yang sebelum ini tidak pernah dimasuki menjadikan diri terlupa dengan amanah yang digalas di dunia dan akhirat
4576604 apabila allah inginkan bagi seseorang pemimpin itu kebaikan akan dijadikan baginya menteri menteri pegawai pegawai yang amanah apabila pemimpin terlupa ia akan mengingatkan dan apabila pemimpin telah ingat ia akan membantunya
4576605 oleh itu gembirakanlah hamba hambaku iaitu mereka yang berusaha mendengar perkataan yang sampaikan lalu mereka menurut yang terbaik mereka itulah orang orang yang diberi hidayah petunjuk oleh allah dan mereka itulah ulul albab

4576612 sesungguhnya aku telah dilantik menjadi pemimpin kamu bukanlah aku yang terbaik di kalangan kamu jika aku betul tolonglah aku jika aku salah betulkanlah aku

4576620 since i talked with manager martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4576621 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry
4576622 i was not doing the talks about barry i was not doing the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4576623 if you want to talk about players you have to talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football talk to me
4576624 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
4576625 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
4576626 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool thinks the price quoted is too high

4576654 ive been using every one of the items for sale in my vegas kitchen viewers will get to buy the same cook wear i use when everybody from vince neil to alice cooper come into the restaurant for dinner we had two of the knives specially crafted in japan with very unique slicing serrated blades the saucepans are top of the line and my name is embossed on the bottom of each one ill showcase some of our exclusive vegas restaurant menu specialties in the cooking demos to go along with the sales blitz
4576655 shes gone shes left town and nobody knows where she is and her plans for the brothel have vanished along with her

4576659 ive enjoyed a wonderful and incredible 18 months right from the very opening of this restaurant
4576660 tao is an extraordinary restaurant and richard and his partners had a fantastic concept and a brilliant creation it was fantastic to be an integral part of a very winning team but now ive got a lot of other opportunities to explore first though i need a vacation in cabo go see mum and dad and enjoy my first love first hand the superbowl before i select something else new and challenging in vegas im definitely staying here in the most exciting dining destination in the world though
4576661 we are very pleased to have mark on board at tao asian bistro we look forward to the new additions that mark will bring based on his previous experiences in some of the countrys best restaurants current chef de cuisine josh thomsen has moved on to pursue other professional opportunities and we wish him the best in those future endeavors
4576662 josh played a very important part in the successful launching of tao and he was loved by everybody here for his skills professionalism and his dedication we know he will go onto bigger successes and we hold him in high regard and wish him the very best he was a valued and trusted employee and will be missed
4576663 its a sad thing in this business that diligent dedicated disciplined journeyman chefs can work away really hard putting in incredible hours to build a business and then when its at the top the owners bring in a star name to give it an extra boost when they cant take it any further its a classic situation in the restaurant business and thats probably exactly what happened here josh was great and did a fantastic job but now they wanted some extra glitz and glamor with a tv name attached to it
4576664 i have the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing our incredible kitchen staff was the best in the business and some nights turned out an amazing 1 200 top notch gourmet dinners at the same time as hosting another 1 000 simultaneously for cocktails there arent many restaurants that could claim that anywhere in the world so i depart on the best of terms knowing we achieved everything and more that we set out to do

4576667 being able to work with the james beard foundation to create this scholarship has been a great honor
4576668 the main idea behind nobhill was to create a restaurant that would reflect the type of dining opportunities found throughout san francisco in one comfortable neighborhood style location
4576669 the menu features a diverse selection of the type of food and fresh products most closely associated with dining in san francisco at least 80 percent of the product comes from growers and producers located in the bay area it is the first time some of the items have been available outside of northern california
4576670 it is to be a humble space this isnt a fusion of anything there is no show there is no las vegas in the room nothing shouting design
4576671 and the food reminds us all why san francisco is such a great food town
4576672 if it catches fire it will melt but the great thing is you can just throw it in the sink to put out the flames

4576691 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher threw the ball at his head and i dont see any place for that in baseball
4576692 i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players or how that game ended lazo is a good pitcher but he hit him in the eye no game of baseball is worth that
4576693 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4576694 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4576695 im not the type of pitcher to do that because its not the correct way to play the game i did not hit him intentionally it was an accident the ball hit the bat first and bounced onto his face thats unfortunate but i was just pitching to get him out
4576696 we won partly because of the new rule but that doesnt mean im in favor of it
4576697 i think it kills classic matches today it worked for us but other nights it will benefit others i would prefer to play the games out
4576698 im not a big fan of it it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good chance to win normally you get a guy on first and battle to get home it was strange running out to second from the dugout ive never done that in my life and probably never will again
4576699 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher threw the ball at his head and i dont see any place for that in baseball
4576700 i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players or how that game ended lazo is a good pitcher but he hit him in the eye no game of baseball is worth that

4576709 la firma de este acuerdo por el presidente saakashvili significa que debe imponerse inmediatamente el alto el fuego y que las tropas regulares rusas tienen que abandonar el territorio georgiano
4576710 georgia est en medio de una ocupaci n y necesita un alto el fuego para ayudar a los damnificados y procurar la retirada de los ocupantes
4576711 expresar la solidaridad y respaldar la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia y a su gobierno
4576712 la soberan a de georgia sobre abjasia y osetia del sur es inapelable
4576713 el plan no prev un nuevo estatus pol tico de abjasia y osetia del sur pues su contexto se basa en las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu que reconocen la integridad territorial de georgia
4576714 ha empezado un amplio debate internacional con el fin de elaborar las medidas para la puesta en marcha de la operaci n de paz
4576715 rusia es la nica que puede decidir si volver a encauzarse por la senda de las naciones responsables o decide perseguir una pol tica que promete s lo confrontaci n y aislamiento
4576716 no les vengan otra vez a la cabeza ideas idiotas
4576717 no se pueden esperar 15 a os para resolver el conflicto
4576718 el punto de partida debe ser la integridad territorial de georgia
4576719 no cada pueblo que desea abandonar una uni n estatal es capaz de llegar a ser un estado independiente si fuera as habr a muchos problemas en el mundo
4576720 despu s de lo ocurrido dif cilmente podr n los osetios y los abjasos vivir en un mismo estado con los georgianos

4576728 why is it not ok to laugh at mean spirited humor like racist jokes but it is ok to laugh at parodies of it
4576729 parodies of mean spirited humor are at the expense of mean spirited people
4576730 since parodies of mean spirited humor target mean spirited people we ought to laugh at the parodies by laughing at them we are reinforcing the idea that no one should be like them
4576731 so what if its a parody lots of people wont get it and will think its ok to make fun of people with down syndrome or intellectual disabilities
4576732 does it mean that because some people will laugh at something for the wrong reasons that you shouldnt do it
4576733 without parody we lose an effective way of not only making fun of the mean spirited and therefore of publicly disapproving of them but also of getting them to realize their own folly as they begin to realize what they are really laughing at

4576735 it the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
4576736 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad she sozen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions
4576737 i dont think the critics will be satisfied with such a motion from the prime minister he has to show that he favours further liberalisation of the country and cares about more than just the rights of the muslim community
4576738 it the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
4576739 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad she sozen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions

4576751 jimenez who has five children has not lost his home yet but is headed that way were going to be struggling for the next i dont know months months i dont want to leave but if they tell me to leave what else can i do says jimenez
4576752 doreen humphries 68 said she wasnt happy with the final selling price and estimated the couples total loss on the apartment to be 300 000 including advertising but we cant worry ourselves into the grave we have to grin and bear it she said

4576754 laurie hicks has had her home for sale in the northeast mayland heights neighbourhood for nearly three weeks for us we honestly believe there are enough young professionals that want to be within five 10 minutes of downtown i believe the right buyer is going to walk in there and say you know what nothing has to be done to this house for 10 or 15 years said hicks who has owned the house for more than a year
4576755 so we are optimistic but having said that we need to have the right buyer she said
4576756 douglas porter deputy chief economist with bmo capital markets economics said pricing power is in full scale retreat across many major markets
4576757 i was planning on just selling it hughes says i had already moved to atlanta even though the asking price is almost 100 000 lower than they had paid for it the house in chattanooga remains unsold at a list price of 329 000 its in inventory with homes that are just like it she says
4576758 the market is creating an opportunity for long term home buyers said john orr managing broker for coldwell banker real estate now
4576759 people lost their homes or tried not to that meant not buying as much in the stores this leads to employee layoffs which leads to more people not buying anything in the stores and not being able to make their payments car dealers suffer fast food restaurants suffer stores suffer all creating even more layoffs everyone suffers all because real estate agents buyers escrow offices and some banks got greedy
4576760 and now real estate brokers are crying because they cant sell anything its called payback
4576761 people are concerned about energy prices theyre concerned about food prices ash said
4576762 its been nearly a decade since greenspans stock hit its all time high with the now famous time magazine cover during the asian financial crisis the one that featured sir alan bob rubin and larry summers as the committee to save the world
4576763 whats so remarkable is how greenspan can spin out his analysis without mentioning his own role in the creation of the massive housing and credit bubbles
4576764 reading or listening to him youd never know this was the fed chairman who kept interest rates too low for too long who denied that there was a housing bubble until it burst and who refused to use the powers given to the fed by congress to prevent abusive practices by mortgage lenders and brokers
4576765 whats surprising in sir alans latest musings is not that they are intellectually dishonest or disingenuous weve seen that before no whats striking is that coming from somebody who has seen so much over so many years they are singularly unwise
4576766 since the early 1980s the value of home equity loans outstanding has ballooned to more than 1 trillion from 1 billion and nearly a quarter of americans with first mortgages have them what has been a highly lucrative business for banks has become a disaster for many borrowers who are falling behind on their payments at near record levels and could lose their homes
4576767 none of this would have been possible without a conscious effort by lenders who have spent billions of dollars in advertising to change the language of home loans and with it americans attitudes toward debt
4576768 calling it a second mortgage thats like hocking your house said pei yuan chia a former vice chairman at citicorp who oversaw the banks consumer business in the 1980s and 1990s
4576769 ads for banks and their home equity loans often portrayed borrowing against the roof over your head as an act of empowerment and entitlement
4576770 one in 2006 from pnc bank pictured a wheelbarrow and the line the easiest way to haul money out of your house
4576771 in 2003 one from citigroup said a home could be the ticket to whatever your heart desires
4576772 in 2004 banco popular said in its make dreams happen
4576773 little by little millions of americans surrendered equity in their homes in recent years as home prices seemed to rise inexorably from one peak to the next as a result the united states has become a nation of half home owners for the first time since world war ii the portion of home value that americans own has fallen to less than 50 percent in the 1980s that figure was 70 percent
4576774 citibanks home equity ads portrayed housing as a revolving account similar to the plastic card in your wallet
4576775 mr capasse worked in the banks division that was repackaging mortgage loans into bundles of loans to resell to investors a practice that enabled lenders to make even more loans in 1993 mr appezzato helped come up with the pitch line less than perfect credit a phrase he said was meant to refer to people whose credit was only slightly problematic
4576776 but by the late 1990s the phrase was co opted by subprime lenders like countrywide financial washington mutual new century and ameriquest
4576777 ameriquest ran an ad in 2004 during the super bowl one of the biggest advertising events of the year that has come to symbolize the excesses of subprime lending the ad showed a woman on an airplane climbing over the man sitting next to her to reach the aisle the planes lights go off during turbulence and the woman slips landing on the mans lap other passengers gasp because it looks as if they were in a sexual embrace

4576786 there is now a concrete proposal with the turkish cypriot association which shows the progress that has been made
4576787 this process only started last september and these types of negotiations are not easy
4576788 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
4576789 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
4576790 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
4576791 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island
4576792 the offer would allow turkish cypriot clubs to play friendlies against clubs from other countries but we are not talking about the setting up of a new national side
4576793 there are also two conditions attached firstly any clubs wanting to take up the offer would have to be affiliated to the official cypriot fa
4576794 secondly in accordance with our statutes the official fa would have to give its approval for these matches to go ahead
4576795 in order for any matches to be staged in the north the ctfa must sign a document whereby they recognise the cfa and agree to become members this must be done by september

4576810 christmas for the last few years has been really productive
4576811 by the time i was 16 i felt very wimpy
4576812 i was at an all boys school so everybodys shouting jock voice hey whats up faggot the weightlifting gave me some kind of physical presence i remember two months into lifting weights this gradual thing of people not messing with me any more im like wow im not getting fucked with i really enjoyed that
4576813 when my fist connected with his cheek his teeth came through the guy was blowing blood and air out of the side of his mouth that was it for me i was kind of a made man after that the seniors respected me my own peer group respected me the teachers kind of respected me i didnt have a lot of hassle from that time on
4576814 the guy shot at me and missed but killed my friend and the next morning after the cops turned me loose i was cleaning my friends brain off the lawn
4576815 i had the remains of his head in my hands thats stuff you dont forget its probably had an effect on me some ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and thats probably added to me being on my own it makes relationships sometimes difficult
4576816 i knew a guy who was driving his tour bus for a time and i said whats the dylan bus like he said its just him his manager his dog and his chef as the last note of the last song is ringing hes already on the bus and gone hes out of there down the road
4576817 i understand that thing dylan still goes out and does 75 shows a year he doesnt need to do it its not like its a money thing in a way im in the same position im in no way bob dylan but i dont need the finances i just do it because thats what i do

4576836 the biggest wave of recasts is due to happen in 2010 and 2011 by some estimates borrowers monthly payments will then surge by 60 80 see chart at a time when property values may still be at or close to their trough
4576837 wha thats a good buy i thought it was a sell
4576838 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet it could go lower
4576839 demand for coins is apparantly off the chart and most dealers are reporting sold out inventory over the past couple of days

4576844 and just as in the 1980s oil will fall and well start buying big vehicles again wash rinse repeat were stupid like that
4576845 im the one with the realtors license i cant lie
4576846 you and your reading you probably want to read this to and drops it on the desk and storms off
4576847 i most certainly believe gold will eventually be an asset to own in coming years however at the onset of deflation gold will be sold indiscriminately like all assets to pay down debt and repair balance sheets
4576848 when debt and leverage are this excessive cyclical inflation simply accelerates the deflationary outcome and makes the unwind more severe
4576849 couples arent fighting over who gets to keep the house theyre scrambling to get away from the burden of it

4576851 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4576852 suppose russia claimed that it wanted regime change in georgia invaded the country slaughtered hundreds of thousands of its citizens deployed wmd in civilian areas raped and tortured prisoners caught saakashvili and hanged him
4576853 they believed that this place was the entrance to xibalba that is why we have found the offerings there
4576854 it is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls

4576859 one of the goals of nrp was to reinvent the way the city delivered services that is yet to be realized working directly with the city we can fulfill that vision
4576860 this department will help the city be more responsive to neighborhoods
4576861 so far as i know the program is the most ambitious of its kind in any large or medium sized american city o nly in minneapolis do those citizens receive such substantial funds to translate their discussions and plans into realities
4576862 in an age when so many people have become disillusioned with government your program clearly demonstrates that empowering people into meaningful opportunities in their own neighborhoods can have a tremendously transformative effect
4576863 support neighborhood organizations strengthen resident involvement in neighborhood and community organizations and coordinate activities between the city and neighborhood and community organizations
4576864 we needed to find a way to sustain it in the long term with a more direct relationship with the city we need to break down the barriers
4576865 it focuses attention of city hall policymakers and staff making sure our relationship with neighbors is close productive and positive the new department will have nrp as one of the programs inside the department but it wont be the only function it will serve as a place where neighbors can interact with the city on a number of issues
4576866 the thing that distinguishes nrp is the level of control
4576867 were talking about real empowerment residents are treated more as equals in the discussion
4576868 the danger of it being a city program is that now the direction is that you get support if you play along but what happens if a neighbor doesnt like the way the city wants to deal with it theres always going to be fear that the funding will be cut off if they become too outspoken
4576869 nobody has explained exactly what the city plan is improving
4576870 it makes neighborhoods subject to the whims of the city council which is a recipe for disaster
4576871 has a fixed amount of money for a longer period
4576872 theres a lot of support to keep the structure like this
4576873 everything is a guesstimate its a grand experiment with nothing behind it
4576874 dont be sad that its over be glad that it happened
4576875 thats exactly where i used to eat lunch on saturdays right there
4576876 when one eats the flesh of tortured animals or the milk of dairy cows or eggs from factory chickens one also ingests the fear the pain the exhaustion and the sorrow of those beings these energies manifest within the consumer in the form of negative attitudes depression and illness

4576933 since negotiating our investment with craigslists board in 2004 we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions we are asking the delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect ebays stockholders and preserve our investment

4576935 i am always motivated to score well when i am playing for my country its not a question of missing out on the test series but the most important thing is to score runs when you get your chance you cant score big all the time but from our side there is never any lack of effort

4577072 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful

4577077 we havent built a new refinery in 30 years our refineries are maxed out we need to expand our refineries because even if we could drill we wouldnt be able to refine the oil
4577078 this is a crisis that will have geopolitical implications if we dont do something about it we have a moral obligation
4577079 dont you think its reasonable and fair for nancy pelosi to allow members of congress including herself to vote up or down on a comprehensive
4577080 i know that 90 of the time it takes to get oil out of the ground is government red tape
4577081 for 25 years the democrats have consistently voted to keep us from developing our resources overwhelming the republicans have voted to make us energy independent
4577082 this is not the american way we need to turn the american people loose to find a way to make us energy independent we have always been able to find a solution to the problem when the leadership allowed the people to do so
4577083 yesterday i met with a fire chief and i asked how the high energy prices were affecting the volunteer fire department he said it is really affecting them they are going to have to make cuts those cuts will come in training costs and equipment replacement
4577084 we are the only nation that has made it virtually illegal to access our own resources
4577085 the democrat controlled congress is the only thing standing between americans and 2 a gallon gasoline or less
4577086 an aide to speaker pelosi was asked what the democrats energy plan was
4577087 there no reason we cant solve our energy problems im here to say its time to separate the sheep from the goats
4577088 i represent the 23 rd district of new york its 15 000 square miles i have the adirondack park the biggest in the nation needless to say theres no subway ive been all over the district the last few days and i have never in my life have people been more concerned about an issue gas prices like they are today when you live in place like i do where people live an hour from school or an hour and a half from work your only option is getting into a car and in some parts of my district there is snow 8 months out of the year not using heating oil is not an option but on this critical issue where is congress on vacation
4577089 when the founding fathers built this great country they wanted this house to discuss the great issues but yet the speaker has decided the house should go on a five week vacation i would say to the speaker who is on a book tour when you were elected speaker it wasnt about having a portrait to hang out in the speakers lobby it was about being the first in line to solve big problem facing the nation i say call this congress back i personally and im willing to say many of my colleagues would as well i will personally buy 100 copies of the speakers new book if that what shes worried about and if that what it takes to call back congress
4577090 let me narrow down this issue both sides agree on conservation both sides agree on using new energy technologies where we disagree is the production of oil there are some on the other side who are so ideologically driven that they want opec to increase supply that means more foreign dependency on oil
4577091 one person should not be allowed to frustrate the will of the majority especially on a pocketbook issue like high gas prices
4577092 when i go home to do meetings with constituents i dont give speeches i simply open everything up for questions every single question is about energy while were out on as five week vacation on taxpayer dime people are suffering
4577093 i would submit that people are tired of all this talk about the audacity of hope they believe in the audacity of action
4577094 before katrina they evacuated the platforms and rigs out in the gulf then the storm hit they returned and there was damage but there were no oil spills the rita cam thru and they went through the same exercise again no oil spill drilling can be done very safely with great respect for the environment why are we not doing more why are we the only country without a significant commitment to drilling off shore why are we not debating this
4577095 i have a good friend in the maritime industry hes in the shipping business and he supports off shore drilling hes trying all he can to keep his business in louisiana but the work is overseas i say lets keep those jobs here lets make new energy jobs here lets build a bridge from the old energy economy to the new energy economy
4577096 the democrats oil drilling flimflam betting the public is too dumb to catch on
4577097 the mantra from barack obama and congressional democrat leaders is that they represent change and when it comes to gas prices they certainly have a point the cost to heat and air condition american homes is certainly changing in very negative ways for the american consumer as is the cost of getting to work or taking a trip with the family
4577098 house and senate republicans appear to have found their voice on the energy issue contrasting their efforts to support offshore oil drilling and exploration in alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge anwr with the democrat leaderships efforts to block it at every turn house minority leader john boehner and senate minority leader mitch mcconnell have spent the past two months doing everything possible to show the link between the democrat leaderships intransigent opposition to drilling and the crushing burden of higher energy prices the american people while discussing weighty matters like primates soccer teams and the like house speaker nancy pelosi senate majority leader harry reid and their allies have dedicated themselves to preventing congress from voting on efforts to expand energy supplies

4577121 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4577122 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4577123 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4577124 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood

4577142 the first reason a prospective student should go to masters is because the academic program is so strong i am an international student from india and i am pre med i came here because of the good reputation all of the professors are experts in their field and have a rational and unbiased perspective which i respect the second reason to come here is because of the people all of the students and professors i have met are of really good character everyone has treated me very well coming from a different country i feel very accepted here the third reason a prospective student should come here is that whenever i needed counseling or was lonely or couldnt understand a professor they always made it a point to help me understand since its such a small college the benefits are huge because you get a lot of personal attention
4577143 the thing that separates masters college from other schools is that we are a four year private liberal arts christian college and a biblical worldview is upheld in all of our classes whether its a biology class or a math class it all comes down to the word of god

4577150 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4577151 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4577152 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4577153 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4577154 im doing things ive never done before im trying more things maybe its because i feel like i dont have that much time left to do everything that i want to
4577155 i have to stay young to keep up with them
4577156 if im going to live that long i want to be in the best shape i possibly can be
4577157 if that isnt a wakeup call to live each day as if it were your last nothing is
4577158 i feel great and plan on fighting the aging process every step of the way
4577159 i feel like i am the best me i have ever been
4577160 i am confident and so sure of myself something that i never enjoyed in my younger years
4577161 turning 50 has given me a new awakening and zest for life
4577162 i want to be an example to women all over that age really doesnt matter
4577163 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4577164 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4577165 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4577166 extraordinary circumstances which affect the security of the russian federation and require immediate measures
4577167 nato regrets this decision by the russian federation it is a step in the wrong direction
4577168 russia continues to expect that other nations that have signed the cfe will fulfill their obligations
4577169 it will seriously spoil relations the kind of soothing effect from the last summit with putin and president bush will evaporate swiftly
4577170 this is basically non compliance and this is an illegal move
4577171 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4577172 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4577173 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4577174 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4577175 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4577176 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4577177 nous avons des cam ras de surveillance mais la question laquelle nous devons r pondre cest de savoir ce que nous ferons si quelquun fait irruption dans une cole cest simplement du bon sens
4577178 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4577179 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play

4577184 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4577185 after winning this gold my first thought is to thank my parents my coach and all the people who have supported me in the past
4577186 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4577187 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect

4577190 there is a typical and ever recurrent egyptian phenomenon which consists of trivialising the achievements of its dead artists writers playwrights etc

4577192 only pittsburgh and new orleans have seen sharper population declines this decade and new orleans was because of a natural disaster
4577193 caught shelly in the trap sometime overnight woohoo i cant say enough good things about brook and carlene holmes who have worked so long and so hard with shelly all their patience has paid off
4577194 everyone for all their help and to elaine munch president of the metroplex animal coalition for getting the trap and delivering it to brook that after about 5 other traps fell through we couldnt have done it without elaine either
4577195 sponsoring rescue group for shelly and a foster who understands she can only go outside on a leash i dont care if its pouring i dont care if the yard is totally dog proof this little girl is going to find a way out
4577196 i hope one day i can just stand up like a normal person
4577197 i never loved a man the way i love you
4577198 last fall at the invitation of john edwards presidential campaign i sat down with elizabeth edwards for a one on one chat among other things we talked about women who stand by men who cheat on them

4577204 12 when he had finished washing their feet he put on his clothes and returned to his place
4577205 you call me teacher and lord and rightly so for that is what i am 14 now that i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also should wash one anothers feet 15i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you 16 i tell you the truth no servant is greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him 17 now that you know these things you will be blessed if you do them
4577206 they should keep it they shouldnt tear this place down it means so much to so many people and it has so much history it doesnt make any sense
4577207 if youve only worked here 15 or 20 years you arent even a veteran youre still considered a newcomer we have no turnover people either retire or pass on
4577208 i retired at 65 but i came back at 70
4577209 i got bored and i missed the people too much this place has been like home to me i used to know the original owners and the people here have always been like my family
4577210 ive seen people lose their homes their businesses betting down to their last dollar
4577211 i was working the irs window and they took 300 000 off the top
4577212 the next day all my friends were asking me what did you get a 10 000 tip i had to tell them he only gave me 40
4577213 my whole family goes back years and years in the business much of it at bay meadows my dad started riding horses in the arizona territory before it became a state my mother was only 4 foot 10 and she was a jockey her father used to take her to mexico to ride in powder puff derbies because women jockeys were illegal in california
4577214 in operations ive done virtually every job forms and programs reserve seats the admission gates i even worked the paddock when i first started
4577215 to me this track has always been the backbone of racing in northern california its the only place i ever wanted to work
4577216 but in five years people probably wont even remember what we were all about
4577217 he was a great horse and if nothing else in my career i can always say that i beat john henry
4577218 as long as youre not riding out of here in an ambulance its a good day
4577219 the doctors said it was 50 50 whether i would ever ride again
4577220 i was out for six months so therell always be a piece of me out on that track
4577221 they pay me so much a day and they let me stay here fortunately i have the same arrangement at golden gate fields
4577222 they gave me such a hard time about that asking things like wow jack when was that in the 30s
4577223 i can remember coming here with my parents even when i was in grammar school back then it was a big deal to come from santa rosa where he grew up to bay meadows
4577224 then i went to stanford both undergraduate and law school and i probably spent more time at bay meadows than i should have i even had it calculated exactly 22 minutes from my dorm room to the track
4577225 but every year since i came in 1992 was going to be the last year and im very proud we fought to keep it open as long as we did people kept expecting me to have some sort of hail mary now and i just dont have one left
4577226 i missed three days in a row for my mothers funeral but thats it other than that ive never missed a day
4577227 but since most of the men were still at war women had to fill a lot of jobs at the track they must have liked me because they eventually gave me a raise to 10 a day back in that time that was a lot of money
4577228 you used to see people like harry james and betty grable at the track because they owned horses
4577229 i remember jimmy durante too he was always here lots of stars were
4577230 i knew every one of those girls and mr kyne too
4577231 id keep working if they werent going to tear it down
4577232 but its ok its time for me to retire i just feel sorry for all the young people who wont be working here anymore its a shame
4577233 our team has responded extremely well to the first few days of pre season
4577234 the scrimmage versus wisconsin will be a good test currently we are putting the foundation in place for the upcoming year we will play with some heavy legs but that is all part of preparing for what is ahead of us overall the ladies have worked very hard this summer and practices have been spirited being away from campus during this time is extremely valuable and the players have embraced the atmosphere they are excited focused and have brought a lot of energy to what we are trying to accomplish

4577236 the long term payoffs of strong talent management far outweigh the costs and complexities associated with up front investments
4577237 the ibm hci study clearly calls for the same rigor in talent analytics and management that ceos and cios require to make the strategic decisions their companies depend on
4577238 there is nothing in the works we did have a roundtable reading a year and a half ago of a lengthy script for phantasm v which was written by steve romano the co writer on dons excellent masters of horror episode incident on and off a mountain road the problem with that one was that it attempted to explain everything and of course nothing is really explicable with phantasm

4577248 i think if you talk to labels and managers youll find that when they the station commit to the record they commit to the artists and they sell records through airplay
4577249 theyre not playing things because they think theyre going to become hits although theyre not averse to playing hits theyre much more a leader than a follower
4577250 these are all stations that are taking chances on artists they hope will be up and coming but basing their decisions on quality and how it affects the local listenership
4577251 we have to keep some of the old institutions but also infuse new things that invigorate the next generation of public radio listeners
4577252 having basically grown up in austin and having had my whole radio career here it lends a perspective to the discussion we dont want to throw out the baby with the bath water
4577253 in the ipod era youve got to be more than a jukebox
4577254 in a way that kind of works for kut other stations can play the music but at kut because of its news component it enables them to dig into these stories and connect the music side with the news side and the original objective of the music news series texas music matters was to do something like that weve also found weve become a platform for people who want to be heard on a national level
4577255 sometimes i feel overwhelmed by the amount of great stories there are to tell
4577256 they went to the armadillo that was their hangout and they would bring that voice to the air people like longtime jocks paul ray and larry monroe are very responsible for what austin sounds like

4577268 our study shows that most people with stroke symptoms still do not get to the hospital in a timely manner
4577269 this precludes them from being considered for time dependent treatments that can reduce disability and death following a stroke
4577270 while patients that arrive to the hospital within 2 hours of symptom onset are more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who do not
4577271 most do not this points to areas where stroke systems of care within hospitals can be improved
4577272 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call emergency services when they occur
4577273 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4577274 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4577275 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4577276 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect

4577300 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
4577301 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
4577302 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up

4577315 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4577316 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4577317 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4577318 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4577319 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago

4577334 im talking about professional soccer leagues with real grass field stadiums several amusement parks big ones markets that are very vibrant
4577335 i am just hoping that now i have made a semi final a few of you guys will get off my back and say i can actually run because it is not that easy to make a semi final of an olympics in the 800m
4577336 there is a lot of pressure on the athletics team for an olympic games and i hope that the public realise if we go as close to our personal best as possible they should know we are doing everything we can to perform
4577337 we dont go out there to not make it through the rounds we actually work our bottoms off and sacrifice a lot so it would be nice to get a heap of support behind us
4577338 my training group all came up and they basically helped me get my speed back so i think you can tell from that run that i am running a heap better than i was in europe
4577339 the first thing i really heard about it was when i got to hong kong australian team camp because i had my phone off a lot so i was just away from it because that is how my coach wanted it
4577340 then when i got to hong kong they told me theyd been getting asked heaps of questions and i was like gosh the girl who was favourite for my event got done for drugs so how is that not a bad thing to say that you are disillusioned going into an olympic games
4577341 the only reason i did that is you have to accept before the 800m heats and i was a little stressed after what happened in osaka
4577342 we have no female sprinters because sally mclellan decided to do the hurdles so i thought i will put my hand up
4577343 i think i can do a 400m pb that might not get me anywhere but it would be nice for me
4577344 were fairly well set up now as to how were going to do it and when were going to do it

4577349 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4577350 i knew that was a hard double for ryan i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4577351 if he wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4577352 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today i think i push him as well
4577353 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4577354 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4577355 thats the theme of the meet youve got to break a world record to win
4577356 i gave it my all but i had nothing left ryan handed me a great race and i have no regrets
4577357 i can tell you i dont want to be competing when im 40
4577358 that was one of the easiest 50s ive ever done
4577359 we both supported each other 100 percent and we just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games
4577360 im still chasing him for that medal count but i have three more finals to beat him
4577361 a few months ago i made a board of pictures and other things that inspired me my mom hung one of his medals on the board and it gave me the extra motivation and it made a difference being empowered to see it every day for those few months
4577362 both of my parents have been a big influence on my life my dad is in the gym with me every day hes the reason i am an olympic champion my mom is on my side providing emotional support its an equal effort
4577363 i was so focused during the race i wanted to make sure i got enough laps
4577364 i had no idea i was third if i knew i might freak out
4577365 any time you sneak in on your last throw and squeak out a medal its special
4577366 i didnt win but i moved from sixth to second and thats something
4577367 i had some big throws and big fouls unfortunately they didnt count
4577368 there is not much good to take out of this i was just throwing down the left sector line and i dont really do that often its inexcusable
4577369 we play really hard and our goal here is to win a gold medal thats the only reason why were here we want to do that we want to end up in the gold medal game repeating for that gold medal at the end of this tournament
4577370 i think tonight was a very tough challenge for us offensively and defensively
4577371 i think we got our focus we played against a very tough team in spain this is lessons learned and hopefully we take from this and move on to the next game
4577372 i knew yesterday i was going for it and that no one was going to take it away from me
4577373 the past few days have been a roller coaster ride but not a bad one because i like roller coasters
4577374 its been challenging to keep my head on straight for my own events
4577375 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4577376 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4577377 ive tried to play this game for as long as i can
4577378 i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4577379 hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that theys why its disappointing because he is a great player i cant take anything away from the fact he won the match
4577380 we were on the court like 2 1 2 hours i was really tired i didnt feel anything
4577381 we are on the heels of those who try to cheat that has been the case over the last five or six years
4577382 this is the last time i will be competing with my brother fabrice so it is very special
4577383 i had a belief that i must win this match
4577384 i am not only representing myself i have a responsibility to fight for my country japans judo is the most fantastic but i was fighting for chinas glory
4577385 i wanted to bring home the gold medal but i guess not
4577386 today is indias independence day i have given a gift to the nation in the shape of this victory
4577387 for the gold medal i dedicate it first of all to my motherland and all the people of my country
4577388 but most importantly i want to dedicate this medal to my dear mother who has passed away not long ago
4577389 i deserve the medal because ive trained for 14 years
4577390 i give thanks to the support of my nation my people and my family the good environment and weather at the venue really helped me
4577391 its an honor and privilege to participate in the olympics
4577392 ive been to the olympics three straight times and every time i have finished in the top eight i know i was the only person from both athens and sydney to do that
4577393 the only thing is that im not confident with how the game ended
4577394 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher pedro luis lazo threw the ball at his head i dont see any place for that in baseball i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players
4577395 it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good shot to win
4577396 normally you get a guy on first and battle to get home it was strange running out to second from the dugout ive never done that in my life and probably never will again
4577397 i felt really good but this is just the first half the second half will be after the gold medal match
4577398 we knew it was going to be tough playing china at their home all we wanted to do was fight
4577399 although we lost the match every player played their best
4577400 its important we find our problems in the preliminaries and find ways to solve them
4577401 we treat every game seriously it is a great opportunity for us to play another game
4577402 shes such a pro she has had really bad heat rash she has really sensitive skin so i could use no leg on her because she wasnt 100 percent comfortable i have a great team behind me to help her out and she amazes me with what a great competitor she is
4577403 the first pattern we noticed was an annual cycle that appeared to be related to seasonal interests and events in search patterns
4577404 search volumes for words like diet and exercise tended to increase sharply at certain times of the year like right around new years for example
4577405 initially the goal of this study was to just look at the google trends service itself and report on its potential as a research tool
4577406 however the appearance of patterns and relationships in the terms used to look at this service now has us asking many more questions and considering how google trends might best help us to answer them as well
4577407 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4577408 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4577409 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4577410 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
4577411 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
4577412 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
4577413 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner
4577414 vehicle of a basically hostile perception of early modern capitalism
4577415 the energy components and the commodity components are weighing on the averages as oil and gold fall the stronger dollar is a negative anchor on anything commodity related
4577416 but thats counterbalanced by a significant outperformance of the retailers which are a continued beneficiary of lower oil
4577417 i feel rex has made improvement like the rest of our ballclub has
4577418 were not ready for the first game yet and you shouldnt be we dont want to necessarily peak yet we have three more games
4577419 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
4577420 those two are battling for a starting job i can remember just battling for a job if you dont play the best game of your life here then you probably dont have a job next week
4577421 in terms of a football career it was life or death
4577422 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates
4577423 im excited youre working with the guys who will be playing in the games its great
4577424 obviously we were a little disappointed in that first drive against k c
4577425 we did run a vanilla defense i think were going to open up our package a little bit more this weekend we definitely want to have a different feeling than we did after the kansas city game
4577426 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4577427 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4577428 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4577429 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4577430 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4577431 for the most part these people have done their time
4577432 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4577433 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4577434 my decision does not reflect any change of heart regarding realignment or my confidence in the vision and leadership of the diocese
4577435 they say we cant ride cause you got to have to have helmets and pants

4577494 with the right brush you can easily create a smooth precise line
4577495 pencil eyeliners are very versatile and can create a softly defined look thats great for day or work
4577496 they can also dramatize a smoky eye look easily because they are wax based and can be smudged with the smudge tip on the end of many lining pencils or with a firm brush
4577497 depending on the firmness of the pencil you can also achieve a very crisp fine line
4577498 the softer formulas can smear or bleed a bit and may need to be cleaned up if you want to wear the liner all day

4577511 some of the proposed actions such as wetlands protection are useful and practical objectives
4577512 sanjiangyuan and qinghai hu are very good projects with huge investments
4577513 but it is huge constituting 25 of the land area of china and very diverse one cannot say the entire plateau is degraded
4577514 if ground vegetative cover biomass production and quality of forage have decreased
4577515 do no science utter proclamations and spend ferociously to engage in activities that are totally unproven
4577516 is a system that has evolved with grazing the removal of grazing from the system could have profound ecological consequences
4577517 for all the money spent there is little evidence to show that poisoning is effective
4577518 the main causes for grassland degradation are overgrazing and climate change killing native wild animals will not solve the problem
4577519 we are just beginning to understand how different drivers such as climate change large herbivore grazing and small mammals interact to affect the tibetan plateau grasslands and the water balance in this system
4577520 the situation in the qinghai lake region illustrates how climate change can have some of its greatest impacts on subsistence oriented communities who are tightly coupled to their natural resource base
4577521 local policies should enhance the herders and the ecosystems resilience and adaptation to these and future ecosystem changes herder relocation and its associated consequences will likely be counter to these goals

4577555 on this new full length from thee silver mount zion memorial orchestra and the tra la la band lets not forget about those guys youll find yourself confronted with a series of twelve brief tracks of feedback overtones ushering in the main body of the record which fires up circa track 13 1 000 000 died to make this sound is the fittingly understated title of this first piece proper striking up with all the bombast youd expect from such a formidably intense band led by a central vocal spat out with a whiny venom reminiscent of public image ltd era john lydon the song develops into a frothing swell of guitar distortion and ferocious drumming before entering a final phase characterised by choral chanting and maudlin overcast strings following on from there the title track comes as a slow lumbering heavy rocker before evolving into something approaching the blues halfway through after all this guitar driven fury the albums second half allows some small amount of respite youll still encounter unforgiving levels of intensity but the guitar abrasion is offset by a more accommodating approach to string ensemble dynamics particularly during the quite wonderful blindblindblind highly recommended

4577561 the third full length by do make say think marks another quantum leap by this toronto based instrumental rock band their space and drone rock foundations continue to serve as the launching pad for experimentation with jazz inflected motifs but with this third album the groups pop sensibility is also on fine display melodic themes laid out by guitars and horns wind along a burbling brook of fat analog synths and phased percussion tiny subtle details are worked into the mix on every track and the whole record just pulses with warmth and soul once again recorded by band members and mixing wizards charles and ohad the stacks of tube gear combined with digital editing have yielded a thick intricate sound overall highly detailed yet still somehow wrapped in a translucent gauze most of the tracking was done at guitarist justins apartment then brought to the studio unlike the bands previous effort goodbye enemy airship the landlord is dead cst010 which resonated with the rural atmosphere of its barnyard recording location the new album is much more up front sounding the arrangements pump with bottom end and the interweaving melodic elements are beautifully shaped and placed while the album conjures diverse emotions there is something consistently ebullient and effervescent about each of the songs aesthetically and technically amp yet amp yet is dmsts strongest and most evocative work to date
4577562 do make say think have fashioned a fourth full length album of tremendous beauty and depth more loosely woven than previous records and played with a dark wistful restraint throughout these new songs are eerie and iridescent composed and captured with mesmerising attention to detail guided by the bands most intricate and intimate guitar passages to date full of delicate transitions and soulful punctuations many of the songs feature a newfound non linearity in compositional structure that once again raises the dmst bar imbuing instrumental rock with heartrending yes even hymnal narrative ideas more than any previous effort by the band this is an album that demands to be listened to as a whole or at least in the triptychs defined by the three sided vinyl edition recorded in three sessions over the winter and spring of 2003 most of the tracks went to tape at two rural locations the resulting campfire vibe on much of this material is reminiscent of the bands second record goodbye enemy airship cst010 but with more density and complexity throughout mixed by the group at thschvitz their toronto home studio the album continues to highlight dmsts inventive production touches always at the service of the musical ideas
4577563 this is the reissue of the legendary earth 2 record earth the band that launched a thousand drones the band that started it all the heaviest band ever maybe earth was the singular vision of only permanent member dylan carlson for 1993s earth 2 dylans guitar was joined by the bass of dave harwell no need look to further than earth 2 to experience the drone the way it was meant to be heard huge downtuned guitars playing riffs so slow that each one lasts forever low end that slides and lurches like a blackened glacier of fuzz and hiss slow motion notes stretched so far that they become a single note washing over you like a sticky wave of tar and molasses melodies that are indistinguishable because the notes are pulled so far apart they threaten to come apart completely

4577577 where kinski once mined the explorations of detuned 80s guitar pioneers such as glenn branca live skull and the dead c these days they set their controls for the heart of the 1970s the cosmic 70s that is this album shows a full affinity with the explorations of heads like popol vuh and terry riley though its definitely heavy in a sabbath vein as well its not kinskis best album however the pop sensibility that held their jams together has floated away the jammy explorations that remain instead are very interesting and often gorgeous but they lack the compositional rigor of riley and vuhs florian fricke this is likely a transitional album for these seattle based explorers these mostly instrumental songs ebb and flow and change shapes yet stay together like a school of brightly colored tropical fish mike mcgonigal this is the second sub pop album from seattles monsters of instrumental post psychedelic rock since their last offering kinski had the chance to tour with everyone from acid mothers temple to mission of burma to comets on fire and well be damned if that doesnt make sense the new album is a logical and thrilling step forward

4577586 and their refinement of the decline is its similarity to the work of zbigniew preisner and specifically his work with film director krzysztof kieslowski this isnt necessarily in sound alone stars of the lid share preisners and kieslowskis sense of restraint of minimalism and stark beauty without resorting to meaningless sentimentalism what we have here is beautiful music in its rawest form horns strings and that haunting reverb drenched guitar all perfectly placed and allowed time to breathe nothing here is rushed you hear passages rise and fall gloriously sounds make an entrance and slowly disappear and nothing ever dares to outstay its welcome arvo part gavin bryars or brian eno would all be more than appropriate comparisons for this stunning collection of work but stars of the lid are almost at the point where they defy comparison altogether of course they have introduced further more overtly classical elements into their mix but the music they are making is quite uniquely their own they are one of those rare bands that has absolutely defined a sound what we are hearing is frankly two musicians who are at the top of their game sharing their carefully measured view of the world with us and allowing us a peek into musical perfection and you really cant ask for anything more than that without a shadow of doubt one of the contenders for album of the year and proof if it were needed that stars of the lid are one of the most quietly important bands of the moment in fact its music like this that makes it so gratifying running a record shop
4577587 long time fore runners of the hardcore emo scene this trio has been putting out records for over ten years often referred to as one of the most influential emo bands ever their chaotic yet poetic style of music is both aggressive and at the same time serene harkening back to the hey day of melodic hardcore when it was still actually hardcore five songs that span their career from their roots as the monster club in the late eighties to a song written about two months ago

4577636 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable

4577652 weve said he can have what he wants his house his security
4577653 the time has come for the military leadership to go and have a quiet word with mr musharraf

4577657 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters

4577672 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
4577673 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
4577674 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers
4577675 it is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer
4577676 we do not go with blackstone in saying that a vicious will is necessary to constitute a crime
4577677 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4577678 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4577679 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4577680 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4577681 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4577682 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4577683 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4577684 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4577685 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4577686 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4577687 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

4577691 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4577692 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4577693 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4577694 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4577695 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4577696 she said the only thing she remembers is she went to go lay down to take a nap and the next thing she remembers is a brief flash of her being arrested the next thing she physically remembers is her being in jail
4577697 the 24 hour period that starts when we say it does
4577698 if you just look at the scrabble application wall its pretty clear that there are a few people who are angry enough at hasbro and ea to want to sabotage the game
4577699 ive had over 10 000 worth of surgery so far and have a lot more to come
4577700 thankfully i have insurance but it wont cover all of it
4577701 i believe we are all here for a reason and i just have to get through this
4577702 probably my lungs and legs have been the hardest parts of all this
4577703 lungs will just have to heal themselves with time but i should be ok with almost everything by early next year
4577704 i have felt a little anxiety from all of this
4577705 im so used to being in control and now im at the mercy of everyone else
4577706 i am irritated and angry that our government is really willing to open up diplomatic relations while gadhafi is still in power since he is responsible for the murders of american citizens
4577707 i would gladly forego the money to have libya remain on the state sponsored terrorism list so long as gadhafis in power
4577708 i dont think we should be doing this in exchange for libya getting a free ride
4577709 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4577710 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
4577711 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4577712 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
4577713 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives
4577714 even though its pop culture thrown straight in there it definitely shows a relaxed approach by the north korean government
4577715 we were living in real time on the web and then we get to north korea and were in the dark
4577716 through this we really open doors and have these unique opportunities and that kind of scares politicians
4577717 it would just suck to wind up in a situation you dont want to be in a place like that
4577718 the last place i would want to be is in a north korean police station trying to explain myself
4577719 the world leaders should rethink their strategies maybe they should spend a night in the karaoke bar
4577720 the results from the second year of the demonstration have profound implications for shaping healthcare reform in america and only add to the growing body of evidence in support of coordinated care
4577721 as the voice of medical groups in america amga has been a champion of coordinated care and these results demonstrate once again the efficiencies and quality that can be found in multispecialty medical groups and other organized systems of care
4577722 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4577723 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4577724 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4577725 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4577726 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4577727 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4577728 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4577729 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4577730 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4577731 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4577732 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy

4577736 we are strong supporters of lasting peace in mindanao as a way to achieve development we do not believe that independence for mindanao is appropriate

4577738 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corp of the philippines
4577739 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere

4577742 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4577743 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4577744 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4577745 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4577748 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4577749 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4577750 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4577751 life would have been very different for all of us
4577752 it sort of brought it all back to the surface at the same time i had got on with my life i suppose i had to you see having older children but especially for the younger children

4577778 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things
4577779 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing
4577780 the australian bankers association does not believe there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4577781 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase
4577782 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4577783 the results of this study are very encouraging with the potential to change the way stable angina is managed due to concerns regarding the tolerability of beta blockers patients tend to receive low doses which may not provide optimal heart rate reduction the results of this study suggest that the combination of ivabradine and atenolol shows real promise in the treatment of patients with stable angina

4577804 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4577805 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4577806 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4577807 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4577808 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4577809 we have no intention of contributing anything to traditional black metal the orthodox thinking involved in the construction of traditional black metal is repugnant and stifling

4577843 es gracioso que supuestamente yo haya construido mi carrera sobre la base de la controversia y que por eso ahora hasta mis modos de crianza y mi vida espiritual perturben a la gente
4577844 lo que demuestra es que la gente no se siente c moda con lo que no le es familiar
4577845 los dos estamos en el club de los que reciben mucha mierda
4577846 realmente no s qu es la cientolog a y como no lo s no estoy en posici n de opinar sobre eso pero no creo que los dem s s lo sepan tendr an que cerrar la boca
4577847 por qu nadie dice nada sobre los cristianos no entiendo es atemorizante si uno lo piensa hay corrupci n en todas las organizaciones cuando las cosas crecen siempre hay manzanas podridas miren la corrupci n y la decepci n que involucr al vaticano y a la iglesia cat lica es una locura si yo vuelvo a bautizarme como cristiana los norteamericanos se sentir an mucho m s c modos

4577854 the long term economic potential of latin america makes this an extremely important market for video games
4577855 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states
4577856 hoe zou ik er in die periode als volwassene uitgezien hebben
4577857 i dont know what the chevy teams do or what the toyota teams do i know what the dodge teams do and feel like they support us
4577858 i think there are things that we can get some more help on i also think there are things that maybe we dont take enough from support from dodge thats more for the people competition directors owners people that work those deals with dodge
4577859 dodge puts out as much support as they can the aero chassis thats all our own stuff so its not any different than anybody else i think the main thing would be the engine and our engines run pretty well i think our engine guys do a great job
4577860 i think that there are tracks that we are down the restrictor plate tracks were probably not as consistently strong as some of the others
4577861 our fuel mileage never seems to be as good as some of the other teams when we run full power and dont try and pull back the carburetor
4577862 but everything else is really good and the teams just need to keep working hard and stepping up and doing the best job that they can
4577863 in 2006 when i was right in the middle of the chase i think i was the only dodge
4577864 last year ryan newman and kurt busch were the only two that were really good it just seems like its always like that there are one or two dodge cars that are really good we have to keep getting better if we want to make the chase and run well
4577865 maybe the applause has gone to his head saying john mccain cost ohio jobs though its just not true
4577866 las prioridades de la gesti n macri en materia de residuos est n claras se procuran nuevos sitios de enterramiento sin tener ninguna pol tica en marcha para cumplir con la ley de basura cero
4577867 nada indica que se piense cumplir con la ley ya que los anuncios hechos hasta ahora son un verdadero disparate tales como el retiro de los contenedores diferenciados y el nuevo pliego de recolecci n por el que se volver a a pagar por tonelada enviada a los rellenos colocando la ganancia de las empresas en relaci n directa al fracaso de la ley
4577868 la soluci n al problema de la basura por los pr ximos 20 a os
4577869 este es el nico paso concreto que macri ha dado en materia de gesti n de los residuos de la ciudad buscar lugares en provincia en donde seguir enterrando basura la prioridad de macri est puesta en lograr m s enterramiento y nada de recuperaci n o reducci n en la generaci n de basura una pol tica fuera de la ley vigente
4577870 el esfuerzo para cumplir con esa meta es muy grande aunque es posible pero hay que empezar ahora y en serio
4577871 yeah coming to michigan is a lot of fun just because we run so well here
4577872 i think it takes every aspect of your team to run well here the engines your strategy the body the setup everything has to be good and i think it shows the strength of our team
4577873 theyre a lot of fun to drive especially when its hot and slippery and that will be fontana when we go back there so that should be fun add comment
4577874 i suspect the policy bias will continue to be to avoid debasing the dollar until we start seeing second order effects from deflationary trends such as higher consumer defaults and heightened stress in the financial system
4577875 but now matter how you slice it the average worker is going to see his standard of living fall
4577876 if the fed faces a choice between deflation and high unemployment or tolerating a significant inflation with or without high unemployment im pretty certain it would choose the latter as the less bad option
4577877 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4577878 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4577879 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4577880 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4577881 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4577882 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4577883 lindsay lohan may be used to tabloid gossip about her own life
4577884 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4577885 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4577886 trust is a big word as a family what we really want is for the police to be impartial for them to be effective but not to have us wait weeks and months for answers about the death of my brother
4577887 we thank them for their support but violence leads nowhere
4577888 were a very close family but weve been destroyed by this theyve taken away a big part of our family he had barely begun to live
4577889 there isnt one answer that will help remedy the situation nor are there any miracle cures
4577890 what we do need is time perseverance and most of all political will
4577891 no me intentes dar gato por liebre que yo s de esto
4577892 everything that made the banana splits hugely popular in the 60s is back including the groups terrific humor and hit music
4577893 we take great pride in having carefully updated the look and feel of the original show for todays kids while retaining all of the elements that made the original banana splits such a hit
4577894 the banana splits is a classic that has been entertaining kids for years
4577895 were thrilled to have this new version on cartoon network for our kids to enjoy today
4577896 the songs made famous by the original banana splits hold a special place in music history and were ahead of their time for young audiences
4577897 universal is excited to debut the new banana splits kids album and help introduce them to a whole new generation of music fans
4577898 reforzar el anclaje de las expectativas de inflaci n en el mediano plazo
4577899 la junta de gobierno del banco considera que esta postura de pol tica monetaria permite anticipar que la inflaci n en m xico se ajuste a las previsiones mencionadas
4577900 ello implica que los riesgos a la baja de la actividad econ mica se han acrecentado
4577901 me parece que es un comunicado m s relajado con respecto a los anteriores

4578347 no major scientist with any long record in this field
4578348 there exists no sound theoretical framework for climate predictability studies
4578349 there are no known scientific studies that show a conclusive physical link between global warming and observed hurricane frequency and intensity
4578350 based its global warming hypothesis on arbitrary assumptions and these assumptions it is now clear are false
4578351 arctic warming during the last half of the last century is due to natural change
4578352 are trumpeting catastrophes that couldnt happen even if the models were right
4578353 the common view that mans industrial activity is a deciding factor in global warming has emerged from a misinterpretation of cause and effect relations
4578354 the sun has been at its strongest over the past 60 years and may now be affecting global temperatures
4578355 it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts

4578402 as an example tomato production in the us consumes four times as many calories as the calorific value of the tomatoes created casava production in tanzania where 23 times the calorific value is gained for each calorie of human energy input

4578404 the calorific value of us wheat is only twice the amount of calories expended to produce it
4578405 as an example tomato production in the us consumes four times as many calories as the calorific value of the tomatoes created

4578408 as congressman paul and i both continue our quixotic quest for the already decided nominations of our parties we felt it important to let the american people see how narcissistic and counterproductive our campaigns had become
4578409 but i was listening on the radio on my way in
4578410 i dont want this to turn into a soap opera or an ordeal
4578411 im a big hawks fan but i had a lot of respect for him you have to be impressed with what theyve done during his career hes a classy player and its a big loss for the league hes a tremendous competitor and you have to believe he just felt he couldnt compete at the level he was accustomed to playing its good he can go out on his own terms
4578412 i have been watching you play hockey since you were with the peterborough petes i was 20 you were 16 i rarely missed a red wings game and watched you grow with the team as a player and as a man i cried when you were hit in the eye with the puck i cried when you had knee surgery i cried when you won the stanley cups and i cried today you are a class act steve yzerman and you are synonymous with hockeytown i have wanted to meet you since the day you first skated onto the ice but never got a chance i knew back then you were going to be something special thank you for 23 glorious years in detroit maybe theres a chance that somehow someday i will still be able to meet the greatest hockey player that ever played the game i have deep admiration and respect for you and i hope you continue to play a part in the red wings successes thank you for being my hero for many years as you will continue to be god bless you on your post career journey hockeytown loves you
4578413 ive been a hockey player since the age of five
4578414 i played hockey all winter and thought about hockey all summer
4578415 steve yzerman was a tremendous hockey player who epitomized everything good about our game he loved the game and played with passion every night
4578416 with his leadership and determination with his devotion to the team concept with his refusal to accept anything less than the best steve yzerman became the symbol of the detroit red wings standard of excellence in the modern era
4578417 it was gordie howe and then wayne gretzky but at an age of about 12 or 13 steve yzerman came into the league and me being from detroit i just took a huge liking to his game and we were both centermen and i just followed his career real closely after that
4578418 when you dont see him every day you dont notice him as much but now that ive seen him up close on a daily basis i think hes phenomenal and hes in the conversation with anybody that has played this game
4578419 i think hes doing the right thing i think hes put a lot of thought into it he had a great end of the season and way to finish his career hes got more than just his knee too its just unbelievable that hes got the heart that hes got his heart sure didnt give up
4578420 i remember during the playoffs in calgary it was the game before he got hit in the eye with the puck it was an off day and steve was having breakfast at a small restaurant he kind of gestured over and said here sit down and have breakfast with me we talked for a good 45 minutes to an hour just about life hockey everything it was such a great experience to get to know the man behind no 19 in a way that i really never had a chance to talk to him to me that was special in my broadcasting career

4578464 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4578465 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4578466 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4578467 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4578468 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4578469 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4578470 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4578471 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4578472 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4578473 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4578474 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4578476 at this time a wide majority of them have announced plans to waive extra baggage fees for military personnel traveling on orders or have never had a fee in place
4578477 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4578478 hope you pay close attention to what san franciscos illegal alien sanctuary policy has wrought
4578479 the men and women of the u s border patrol guarding the southern land border come into constant contact with drug and human smugglers criminals and migrants every so often they even encounter mexican military personnel making unauthorized incursions across the border into the united states
4578480 building this infrastructure is an important step toward creating a secure and enforceable border
4578481 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4578482 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
4578483 russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
4578484 however despite the tough talk in public american diplomats conceded that the us had few options and ruled out military intervention on behalf of georgia
4578485 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense
4578486 as so many times in the past from the fall of hungary and czechoslovakia to cambodia afghanistan and kuwait we know that the price of inaction in the face of aggression is tragedy and suffering for countless innocents a price far above the sacrifice required to meet aggression head on
4578487 when i scanned the headlines this morning this conflict didnt look that serious i thought it was georgia vs russian backed rebels no its
4578488 at least when russian tanks rolled into czechoslovakia exactly 40 years ago they did not shoot to kill
4578489 into this stewpot vladimir putin has dropped literally a bombshell
4578490 these creditors certainly their counsel have to know they will never collect so much as 35 from mike nifong
4578491 this was a remarkable decision it demonstrates that the u s courts understand open source and the creative commons
4578492 we now have a good answer to anyone who asks but has it ever been tested in court yes it has and the conditions of the licenses are enforceable
4578493 as a leader of the activism i feel like theyre trying to target me for standing up to their unfair laws
4578494 very simply put we want to eliminate the violence in and around our schools
4578495 the two incidents we focused on most last year didnt happen on school grounds since that time all law enforcement has worked very closely with the school district police to make schools as safe as they possibly can
4578496 i am pleased to see the community come together in this effort
4578497 when chris was killed in february that was one of the things i wanted to see grow out of his death
4578498 as we get closer we will be talking about deployment aspect we are going to be committing recourses during certain times of the day around schools throughout the valley
4578499 going to see fireworks park i wanna see grandma and grandpa fireworks i wanna go to the park etc
4578500 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4578501 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4578502 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4578503 the challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
4578504 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
4578505 the waiver is required because under u s law any country that provides weapons or nuclear capabilities to countries like iran north korea and syria is prohibited from getting american technology or entering into any contract for american technology
4578506 it would be illegal for nasa unless they had a waiver to actually contract to use the soyuz to get to and from the space station
4578507 but that was before the hostilities in georgia my guess is that in the senate the attitude is going to be much less friendly toward cooperation with the russians
4578508 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
4578509 this tension with the newly energized and resurgent russia being run by a man that fancies himself as the czar of russia vladimir putin is now going to cause a very serious problem in our american space program
4578510 we feel that while its possible that government to government issues could have an impact on our relationship we havent really picked up any word or any feedback from the hill that thats what will happen
4578511 the administrations lack of contingency planning and its penny wise pound foolish budgeting for nasa have put the nation in the position where we dont really have a good alternative to depending on russia for the next seven years unless the nation is prepared to start providing significant additional funding to nasa
4578512 a majority of these half billion dollars for investment in rural water systems is the result of usda moving the 2008 farm bill funding out to communities in a timely manner
4578513 maintaining quality of rural life with safe and reliable water systems is vital to the health of the surrounding agricultural community
4578514 i think without question the overriding factor remains the commodity sector as a whole
4578515 fundamentally there was no reason for the sharp rebound over the past couple days and the perception seems to be that every day the crop is getting larger

4578526 sfi offers the perfect opportunity for a disabled veteran like myself to add to my monthly income i think that this is the best system that i have found to produce an income that will be both growing steadily i am looking forward to building my network and building residual income with sfi

4578535 we had requested this funding in the fiscal year 2008 labor health and human services and education appropriations bill
4578536 in talking with school officials i was convinced that this was an outstanding training program that could become even better with some additional funding i am pleased that the department of education agreed with our assessment
4578537 we are excited about the positive and profound impact that this additional professional development will have in developing leadership capacity at every level within our system
4578538 our school systems focus on providing engaging work to our students will be enhanced through this additional funding
4578539 poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permission of another

4578545 it is a sure bet if griffin had said suck it mohammed there would have been a different reaction
4578546 if these two prostitutes keep doing what they are doing
4578547 we of course will punish them first we call them to join islam but if they keep what they are doing we can stone them or even kill them if they keep tempting men in order to put them far from islam
4578548 be the first one to cut the heads of madonna and britney spears
4578549 he put his arms around me in a bear hug i kind of pushed back and he said oh come on now i need things too and i said no
4578550 its hard to tell how many other people hes done that too and im not going to let him do me like that
4578551 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4578552 we will not sacrifice this investment and growth plan for short term results
4578553 with great force and clarity mufwene shows how the structure and history of language may be illuminated by using the core concepts of evolutionary theory such as social dynamics and competition and selection among variants
4578554 must read for anyone seriously interested in questions of language change and language evolution and courageous enough to challenge their views against a fresh perspective

4578556 a language changes like a flu epidemic the change doesnt go necessarily from door to door its a gradual and cumulative restructuring process of transmission and acquisition determined largely by who one has interacted with
4578557 individual speakers do not plan to change their communal language during their communicative acts
4578558 they dont consult with each other on how to say things yet similar patterns emerge the invisible hand he said works within a population of speakers creating new convergent patterns among individuals driving some variants out sometimes producing new ones and generating new forms or structures
4578559 what mufwene does is to forcefully argue that well documented facts related to the formation of creole languages should actually teach us fundamental insights about the evolution of non creole languages such as english and the romance languages much like creole languages english and the romance languages emerged in situations of language contact with meticulous detail mufwene debunks core aspects of the position that the development of these languages is fundamentally distinct from that of creole languages
4578560 english is far from functioning as the vernacular of many parts of the world
4578561 language evolution is driven primarily by the interplay of local ecological factors which are largely socio economic
4578562 hes moved from the specific to the ever more general and hes one of the leaders in proposing to think about creoles as socio historical phenomena
4578563 more than bush and dr rice if the democrats want to make negotiations with syria hamas and hezbollah this means the democratic party understands well what happened in this area and i think pelosi will succeed i hope she wins the next elections
4578564 we would like to thank all those who helped us reach our fund raising goal
4578565 i feel the united states is engaging in an illegal occupation i dont want to bless that occupation with my presence it will not do
4578566 that there are many in our nation and in our congress who believe in direct diplomatic engagement jimmy carter jesse jackson and nancy pelosi come to mind it is what us president franklin roosevelt called the science of human relations
4578567 he just won his fourth norris trophy hes one of the best players in the game hes a leader
4578568 zetterberg will be a captain on this team one day
4578569 is it now is the time right but if brendan comes back hes been around a long time and hes been a leader for us draper is a leading candidate we have a lot of options
4578570 i want to see what steve thinks the staff thinks talk to mike and i have my own thoughts and well come to a conclusion we certainly have candidates
4578571 were fortunate having steve here so long hes been a great role model as a leader and a lot of the foot soldiers whove followed him are ready to step up and take over holland said
4578572 they watched one of the greatest leaders and captains in the history of our sport
4578573 whoever is the next captain sure is in tough draper said
4578574 but we have some great leaders in there stevie helped by showing what it takes to be a leader what it takes to be prepared and be a professional
4578575 well ill start by saying this do not blame this game on the pitching okay
4578576 what this does is it provides us better capability increased competencies more experience and greater knowledge to do the things that we are already doing today
4578577 theyre going to be able to bring back an esprit de corps that you learn within the seal community we dont always have that
4578578 we have a great service im very proud to wear the blue but the esprit de corps that comes out of the folks that go to buds and members of seal teams those experiences that knowledge that mindset are all things that are going to benefit the coast guard in the long term
4578579 what that means to us is approximately two seal platoons
4578580 this just adds a greater base of qualified candidates that dont come from recruits in the navy or from the fleet its a win win for everyone
4578581 valuable skills and knowledge to support the dod and increase the coast guards capabilities in our ports waterways and coastal security mission specifically counter terrorism and anti terrorism operations
4578582 when you look at the way the coast guards evolving bringing in that type of mentality and culture and understanding of the operations is going to be great for our organization
4578583 this is historic its different but i think its very consistent with the long partnership weve had with the united states navy stretching all the way back to our birth 218 years ago
4578584 has found muslim communities to be very open and interested to his perspective on faith and what jesus has to offer
4578585 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4578586 you are dealing with a people who despise anyting human
4578587 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4578588 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4578589 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4578590 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4578591 is that an officially licensed duels t shirt from j nx i love duels duels allows me to control my own destiny as i combine the detailed character building and advancement of massively multi player online role playing game with the strategic and collectible elements of collectible card games
4578592 i dont just play the game i work on it
4578593 one day i saw an ad for a job posted online i applied for that job interviewed for it and now i work there
4578594 i am kuth eh ket high phearaux of the abtu kahn i hope that you will pardon this intrusion
4578595 it is our custom to use the scarbis only in times of dire need to invade the mind of another being is grossly inhospitable to invade the minds of a city would be inexcusable but for the grave circumstances at hand
4578596 to understand the danger we mutually face you must understand the notion of qa the great mission
4578597 in the beginning there was naught but the cold void then before anything else came to be there were the ket the creators
4578598 corveyne man and djena woman they could sense each other in the darkness but they could not see
4578599 they spent many ages wandering in the darkness lost and calling for each other finally in desperation corveyne plucked out his eye and used its light to cut through the darkness
4578600 unfortunately the strain of birth was too much for djena and she faded away into the blackness
4578601 in a desperate attempt to find her corveyne tore out his remaining eye hoping to create a new light for her to follow home
4578602 but the moon that was created gave off no light now he wanders the universe blind and screaming the name of his lost love
4578603 we are the children of ket abandoned while our parents wander the vast emptiness of the cosmos alone
4578604 only the concentrated power of the followers of qa can bring them back
4578605 we attempted to share the truth of qa where we could
4578606 marked as heretics by the bald distrustful denizens of this continent we returned to our homeland we had a desperate need to spread the truth and save our gods but no one to spread it to
4578607 it was ahmett who first saw the truth of the portals
4578608 if we could not share the truth on makanis we could bring it to the universes
4578609 and so it has been for seven hundred years though stories of the great crusaders make up much of the book of qa no missionary ever returned to our world
4578610 something beyond belief beyond terror and beyond the truths of nature has come back with him once again we must ask the men elves and other beasts of the west for assistance our ships have already sailed

4578614 try to make it back in august the tomatoes should be ripe for the picking by then
4578615 i planted brandywine tomatoes this season and i want to know what you think
4578616 how do you know that tomorrow is julia childs birthday
4578617 yes uh oh i really dont want to say this i thought silently this time
4578618 im growing these heirloom tomatoes she said you know the ones named in honor of julia child and im afraid they are all getting attacked by

4578620 ill go get us a table and you meet me next door

4578622 it would be imprudent for companies to upend traditional practice and focus on the demand for obscure products the data show that it is difficult to profit from the long tail
4578623 when i differentiate between artists on smaller independent labels and those on major labels i find that the former gain some market share at the tail end of the curve as a result of the shift to digital markets however the advantage quickly disappears as we move up the curve a more significant trend is that independent artists have actually lost share among the more popular titles to superstar artists on the major labels thus digital channels may be further strengthening the position of a select group of winners
4578624 in my most recent correspondence with managers at nielsen soundscan i learned that of the 3 9 million digital tracks sold in 2007 the large majority for 99 cents each through apple itunes an astonishing 24 sold only one copy and 91 3 6 million tracks sold fewer than 100 copies

4578630 eu respondi duramente a tua acusa o e pedi que voc conversasse comigo sobre o tipo de atitude que tu estava tomando diretamente contra todos os volunt rios que trabalham para realizar o puj
4578631 percebi que continuar aquela linha infeliz de bater boca em p blico estava minando a boa conversa sobre o puj que tinha a participa o de v rios alunos at o momento
4578632 ativei a modera o e esperei o teu email que chegou devidamente transtornado na modera o evitei a chegada do email na lista te avisei sobre isso e pedi que tu repensasse aquela linha de discuss o em p blico
4578633 mas temos que ter um m nimo de estabilidade diante de cr ticas mesmo nos momentos de maior irrita o isso ao meu ver um dos indicadores de lideran a e demora para a gente aprender a se controlar
4578634 bloqueando o teu email eu tentei te preservar e me preservar tamb m porque n o sou de ficar calado diante de desaforo

4578639 estou realmente muito decepcionado contigo um cara que eu comentei v rias vezes para os demais coordenadores que seria um timo coordenador e que poderia me substituir ou ajudar a coordenar o grupo junto comigo
4578640 n o vou estender a discuss o boa sorte na tua vida e espero que tu s volte a a lista do cejug se um dia apresentar maturidade e estabilidade emocional para tal
4578641 gostaria que tu estivesse participando mas pelo texto acima tu est mais preocupado em provar teorias gen ricas sobre conspira es diversas do que reconhecer que cometeu um erro e seguir adiante

4578650 it really has both elements of comedy and drama its kind of a slice of life type film

4578668 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4578669 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4578670 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4578671 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country
4578672 im not interested in drumming up false fears or falsely allaying fear
4578673 to the west martyrdom has a really bad connotation because of suicide bombers who call themselves martyrs
4578674 really martyrdom is actually something that historically was quite noble because it was about standing up and rejecting tyranny rejecting injustice and rejecting oppression and if necessary dying for that
4578675 was sweet and honorable they are dying for their own self respect its terrible to deprive someone of their self respect

4578678 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4578679 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization

4578706 atrocity of 15th august 1998 was an attack on all of the people of ireland
4578707 as we continue to build a peaceful and a better future it remains an indelible stain on our history that will never be forgotten
4578708 we condemn these attacks which are clearly designed to create tension in the local community
4578709 we are taking a giant step forward toward developing a health care system that focuses on quality and affordability through the implementation of health information technology
4578710 the greatly expanded icd 10 code sets will enable hhs to fully support quality reporting pay for performance bio surveillance and other critical activities conversion to icd 10 is essential to development of a nationwide electronic health information environment and the updated x12 transaction standards are a critical step in the implementation of these new codes
4578711 now is the right time to move forward with the transition from icd 9 to icd 10
4578712 we recognize that the transition to icd 10 will require some upfront costs but each year of delay would create additional costs both because of the limitations of icd 9 and because of the need to employ the greater precision that icd 10 codes provide to support value based purchasing of health care and other initiatives we will continue to work collaboratively across the health care system to ensure a smooth transition to use of the updated transaction standards and icd 10

4578722 i had a lot of information i saw the rangers game we needed quality and this is a good guy
4578723 before the questions comes about mr romanov i will tell you something i was the person who decided that if the time was there when kaunas did not have any chance in the champions league or uefa cup that i needed this guy here
4578724 he is a very talented goalkeeper we need goalkeepers here
4578725 i saw this goalkeeper in the training camp in germany when he played two games he convinced me
4578726 i think that the best possibility is to know that we look for quality the owner also wants quality we dont do too many transfers
4578727 the hungarian goalkeeper is very talented but it is a decision between me the goalkeeper and the club
4578728 at the moment he told me he would fly back we made an offer
4578729 he told me he wants to think about this you cannot force someone to come here
4578730 i call her miss cindy shes a super nice lady and its just so unfortunate that something like this would happen to someone whos so kind and wouldnt harm anyone shes just a really nice lady

4578732 tindak pemberantasan korupsi selama ini gagal menyentuh pejabat berkuasa hal itu bisa dilihat dalam kasus aliran dana bank indonesia yang diduga diterima dua menterinya yakni ms kaban dan paskah suzeta presiden tidak berani memecat kedua menterinya itu
4578733 pemberantasan korupsi di lingkungan pemerintahan yang dipimpin oleh presiden juga masih berjalan lambat korupsi dan suap masih cukup banyak terjadi di berbagai instansi pemerintahan terutama lembaga lembaga vertikal meski ada upaya perbaikan
4578734 upaya pencegahan korupsi masih jalan di tempat rencana fundamental seperti mereformasi birokrasi serta reformasi lembaga penegakan hukum termasuk peradilan kejaksaan dan kepolisian belum sepenuhnya berhasil diwujudkan
4578735 pemerintah harus serius melakukan reformasi birokrasi di lingkungan pemerintahan termasuk di instansi penegak hukum serta mereformasi sistem pengadaan barang dan jasa

4578742 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia

4578778 were all very excited about being part of the bill for the upcoming tour with five finger death punch in this moment and bury your dead its definitely going to be a breakthrough tour with those amazing bands we are honored to have the opportunity to play with a band like five finger death punch that has broken through mainstream radio this paves the way for new bands like us to show people who we are and what our music is about this will be a killer tour and will hopefully help us get to the next level as a band

4578781 ross you know we miss your brother terribly and we wanted him to know that we support him as he fights the axis powers
4578782 so you changed my name so that it be the same as some freaking dead president for what patriotism how do you explain that to people oh hi my names not ross anymore now its ted back off mcgregor

4578786 are you sure exuberate is the right word for your sentence
4578787 che or scusa ma che or ke non lo posso perdere lultimo spettacolo
4578788 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4578789 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4578790 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4578791 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4578792 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4578793 its going to boost their self esteem and help send them back to class with confidence
4578794 this year our mens ministry will be giving away neckties and we have some with the matching suspenders
4578795 i cant wait to see how they go really we just want to give back and show love in a tangible way
4578796 we are seeking to minister to the whole person not just from a religious standpoint because we understand there are other things in the house that need to be addressed
4578797 that theres a group of people that believes that christ was accurate when he said its more blessed to give than to receive
4578798 kolo is still short but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4578799 so compared to wednesday night nasri and kolo are back in the squad
4578800 mark 10 21 says jesus looked at him and loved him what a beautiful image jesus looked at people he looked them in the eye he recognized that they existed instead of turning his gaze in the other direction and feigning ignorance people who had been hurt ostracized disowned people who were dirty and diseased he looked at them not out of disgust or superiority but with love he loved them he helped them he invited them to eat and hang out with him spirit help us follow christs example to look and to love

4578807 all my life ive wanted to see the day when men would conquer space and explore the planets and i wanted to take part in it
4578808 escaping from earth will not always be automatically expensive contrary to the impression created by a saturn launch the energy needed to reach space is remarkably small commercial space flight is now beginning to be technologically feasible and will soon become economically viable
4578809 tourism is the first market for the new spaceflight industry as thousands of people with the dream to see the earth from space for themselves sign up for rides on suborbital spaceships which will become increasingly affordable
4578810 and so when the spaceshipone opportunity came up i was very excited to pursue it
4578811 that moment marked the end of the beginning of the commercial space age
4578812 ok so i guess i wont quit my day job
4578813 the fred hutchinson cancer research center has announced that it is changing its name and its focus due to the recent development of the cancer hiv vaccine
4578814 we are extremely pleased and honored to be a part of this wonderful project
4578815 we are grateful to the remarkable men and women who have developed breakthrough medicines that are now capable of defeating these devastating diseases and we hope to continue to provide the funding necessary to bring these cures to every person who needs them in every corner of the world
4578816 another scientific breakthrough from the allen district of seattle what a place it must be
4578817 so he finally broke down and released another set of songs
4578818 hey hey lbj how many babies did you kill today
4578819 they are surely disbelievers who blaspheme and say god is one of three in the trinity for there is no ilah god except one allah if they desist not from saying this blasphemy verily a grievous penalty will befall them the disbelievers will suffer a painful doom
4578820 we will force our religion down your throat whether you like it or not
4578821 if allah say stone them to death through the prophet mohammed
4578822 then you stone them to death because its the obedience of allah and his messenger nothing personal
4578823 oranges and lemons says the bells of st clements you owe me five farthings says the bells of st martins
4578824 if anyone contradicts or opposes the messenger not allah after guidance has been conveyed him and follows a path other than the way we shall burn him in hell
4578825 we shall fight them on the beaches we shall fight them on the landing fields we shall fight them in the fields and in the streets we shall fight them in the hills we shall never surrender
4578826 believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man amp god i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
4578827 allah is the greatest i bear witness that there is no god except allah i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of god prayer is better than sleep
4578828 allah is the greatest there is no god except alllah
4578829 hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord
4578830 fee fi fo fum i smell the blood of an englishman be he alive or dead mohammed will have his bones to grind his bread

4578832 alex is probably the most autobiographical character ive ever written
4578833 ive been to the va hospital here in d c ive talked to a lot of veterans who have been in previous wars including the first gulf war they get forgotten these people unless we keep an eye on the ball and just keep talking about this will be in a sense forgotten too because well be on to the next war and the focus will be on that but theyve got to live their lives so we have to really make sure we keep thinking about them
4578834 anybody who is who they are got there for a reason
4578835 i wrote for a year on this show called the pacific we follow a group of marines from the beginning of the war all the way through all the island campaigns to the end thats going to be on hbo in 2010 i wrote a couple of hours of that

4578839 i cannot exclude electricity from my thinking when i think of making any plans i have to factor the lack of electricity
4578840 we cannot work without electricity because generators are not dependable
4578841 when i decided to purchase an updated model of my bakery i did not think of electricity
4578842 i could not operate it at all because of the inconsistency of electricity the bakery needs stable power it cost around 45 000 dollars now im ready to sell for 20 000 dollars
4578843 now the province gets power from iran under a contract signed about two years ago between the iraqi government and iran
4578844 it is supposed to build voltage regulators each 100 kilometers from the border to the province to avoid loss in the power
4578845 there is another line of power from iran which is being worked on and should be finished within a month
4578846 this will have a great effect on the improvement of the voltage and increasing the hours given
4578847 some houses burnt down because of the extremely high voltage from these
4578848 scientists will be shocked to see what iraqis are doing it shows how much people are suffering
4578849 the shortage of rain which last winter was 30 percent of what it was in previous years has led to an obvious impact on water levels in the tigris and euphrates and their tributaries
4578850 the lack of water from irans al wand river and from the darbandikhan dam in the kurdistan regional government krg has caused lake hamrin to lose nearly 80 percent of its capacity
4578851 people cannot sleep on the housetops at night where it is cooler
4578852 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4578853 in an election campaign in which not only young liberals but also some people who are neither young nor liberals seem absolutely mesmerized by the skilled rhetoric of barack obama facts have receded even further into the background than usual
4578854 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4578855 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4578856 its a pity that when we are still faced with a most complicated situation to work on the united states is further aggravating the situation in relations with russia
4578857 russia is strong and russia has to be reckoned with

4578900 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4578901 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
4578902 the war in georgia is a war for the west
4578903 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
4578904 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world

4578907 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
4578908 this study is the first to examine in young children both the neural response to pain in others and the impact of someone causing pain to someone else
4578909 who caused the pain an fmri investigation of empathy and intentionality in children
4578910 consistent with previous functional mri studies of pain empathy with adults the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodynamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first hand experience of pain including the insula somatosensory cortex anterior midcigulate cortex periaqueductal gray and supplementary motor area
4578911 although our study did not tap into explicit moral judgment perceiving an individual intentionally harming another person is likely to elicit the awareness of moral wrongdoing in the observer

4578913 absolute measurement of air fluorescence yield for ultra high energy cosmic rays
4578914 this detector sheds light on one of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics the origin of cosmic rays my work has to deal with how cosmic rays are affected by their journey from their source to earth a trip that takes them through the galactic magnetic field and the diffuse background of particles inhabiting interstellar space

4578916 protons and neutrons are composed of quarks and the question is whether quarks themselves are composed of even smaller particles
4578917 the higher the energy of the collision the smaller the size of the particle you might be able to find
4578918 until very recently all efforts to solve the einstein equations in computers were interrupted by unexpected growth of numerical error
4578919 at the time there is no universal approach to the solution of the general relativity equations
4578920 the method is quite general can be applied to a great number of physical theories and has thus far been very successful with the einstein equations
4578921 i think this has been the coolest weather we have ever had in memphis during the pre season
4578922 it has always been a really challenging time of year and that is not to say that it is not still hot but it is a lot better than it has been in past years that has made it a little bit more productive in terms of getting more energy from the players it has been great to be back in camp so far
4578923 it is a super game we know exactly what to expect from christian brothers it will be a highly competitive match
4578924 clint browne does a great job with his lads overall i just think it is a great game for the city of memphis and for both of our programs to have in the pre season we are very fortunate that we dont have to go far at all to get the type of match that you need in camp
4578925 we really feel that each one of the seniors deserved the title of captain
4578926 they are all very unique individuals and are strong in their own way however as a coaching staff we feel they are actually strongest as a group as a unit these six guys can really lead this team in the direction that we want i think each one of their characters will come through for us at different points throughout the season these six seniors have been through so much as members of this program they have played the toughest schedule that this program has ever seen during the last four seasons they will be a big help with all of the newcomers that we have added to the program
4578927 i have really just been trying to help the newcomers and the guys who have been around for the last two seasons that it takes a lot of hard work to be the elite team in the conference
4578928 i have been through it before as a part of the 2004 c usa championship team you just need to work hard and the rewards will come after that
4578929 practice has been pretty intense during the last two weeks we have been doing a whole lot of running and different drills all the hard work will definitely all pay off in the end
4578930 we are coming in here we are very excited coming in here as freshman the first scrimmage is coming up tomorrow against christian brothers so things have been pretty intense in practice we are just ready to go out there and get after it
4578931 the six seniors have been a great help as far as leadership goes
4578932 they have been showing us the ropes and making it clear that we need to get used to all the new things that we are learning and break into everything fast
4578933 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4578934 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4578935 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4578936 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4578937 from what weve learned thus far no one has ever brought together such a diverse range of players in this conversation
4578938 are more comfortable using shared technology resources whether its blogs wikis google maps or twitter bamboo aims to explore similar ideas and approaches to better support research and scholarship
4578939 many of the participants had more fundamental questions about social networking building communities and the way digital scholarship would be valued for instance they wondered how digital scholarship should fit into the tenure process should scholars be rewarded as much for a significant digital contribution as a monograph there was interest in discussing very fundamental questions this is a planning grant so we wanted to listen to the community and go where they wanted to go
4578940 thats the benefit of bringing together groups that institutionally often dont talk to each other you learn that art history and astronomy have a lot to learn from each other
4578941 its just different approaches all are valid its part of our learning process
4578942 a close engagement with the research methodologies and teaching practices employed by our faculty is woven deeply into what we do in humanities computing and informs our decisions on the types of services we provide
4578943 its something we take for granted here but its pretty unique and its rewarding to share our model with others
4578944 i come from mount elgon where things are still not calm people are still arguing over land there but here a few of us live together and so we feel safer
4578945 we still live in tents but with ircs help weve dug pit latrines built a refuse pit and put up a drying rack so our pots and pans dont sit on the ground in the dirt we also have a tippy tap thats a tap for hand washing but you turn it on by using your feet it means you keep clean without contaminating the water supply
4578946 because when we all live so close its easy for diseases like diarrhea to spread so we mustnt be careless

4578960 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4578961 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4578962 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4578963 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4578964 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4578965 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4578966 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4578967 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4578968 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4578969 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4578970 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4578971 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4578972 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4578973 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4578974 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4578975 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4578976 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4578977 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4578978 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things

4578981 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4578982 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4578985 you are the christ the son of the living god
4578986 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
4578987 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4578988 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
4578989 we want to make sure we got our game plan set

4579004 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4579005 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4579006 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4579007 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in

4579017 anybody who talks about my tv kids that upsets me i am very protective i love them very very much
4579018 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4579019 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4579020 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4579021 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4579022 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
4579023 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected
4579024 it feels really good in this economic climate for me as not only an artist but as a businessman to be able to present something to america that i know will make things a little easier for people
4579025 clearly fundamentals are shifting in favor of the dollar global growth is slowing taking pressure off commodity prices export gains are lowering the u s trade deficit and theres now a better than 60 chance europe including the u k will have to cut interest rates
4579026 those are the best fundamentals for the dollar in about three years
4579027 should not conclude that buying the dollar or assets that benefit from a stronger dollar is a position without risk i e a slam dunk
4579028 theres little on the domestic economy side to make u s investors feel good and all it would take is another unexpected large write off for housing losses by a bank or a disruption in oil supplies somewhere in the world to start the negative sentiment stirring again and the dollars rise would end
4579029 nadie sabe el dia ni la hora ni siquiera el hijo solo el padre
4579030 kind of reminds me of that after the reichstag was burned they blamed the communists for it and put the leader of that country hitler in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted
4579031 youll always find this muslim standing up for your right to be atheists all you want
4579032 compulsion in religion is distinguished peculiarly from compulsion in every other thing i cannot be saved by a worship i disbelieve and abhor
4579033 if they turn back from islam becoming renegades seize them and kill them wherever you find them
4579034 as the lutheran theologian said it is the role of unbelievers to force religions to be benign weve made good progress on that in the last 200 or so years the small percent of atheists such as andrew quah who side with the remaining holdouts in oppressing woman and gays may lack a good belief but they also lack a moral compass
4579035 its essentially a public outreach arm for the bush administration to reach out to the far right of the evangelical christian movement

4579041 how could you nonviolently kill somebody i would love to be able to do that

4579043 the believers will be in delightful bliss on couch like thrones gazing their thirst will be slaked with pure wine
4579044 unending and unforbidden exalted beds and maidens incomparable we have found them in a distinctive fashion and made them virgins loving companions matched in age for the sake of those of the right hand
4579045 a multitude of those from the first and a few from the latter will be on couch like thrones woven with gold and precious stones reclining facing each other round about them will serve boys of perpetual freshness of never ending bloom with goblets jugs and cups filled with sparkling wine
4579046 round about them will serve devoted to them young boy servants of their own handsome as well guarded pearls they will advance to each other drawing near engaging in mutual enquiry
4579047 they will not urinate relieve nature spit or have nasal secretions their combs will be gold and their sweat will smell like musk

4579054 i think youre a little confused compadre ill get back to you later somebody help our friend to the lounge so he can get some air now
4579055 i have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists
4579056 i am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with to assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of earths climate today is the optimal climate the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesnt change first of all i dont think its within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change as millions of years of history have shown and second of all i guess i would ask which human beings where and when are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today right now is the best climate for all other human beings i think thats a rather arrogant position for people to take
4579057 despite what we may have been told it has not been proven that human caused global warming is occurring and in fact there is substantial reason to reject such claims the best explanation for the evidence is that whatever global warming trend exists is mostly the result of natural influences like variations in the climate system and variations in solar radiation the suggestion that human activities will cause significant changes in global temperature and sea level in the next century are flawed predictions which havent been conferred by observations
4579058 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4579059 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4579060 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4579061 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4579062 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4579063 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4579064 he mevedev confirmed that he was also going to sign the agreement and that russia would scrupulously respect its commitments to the accord notably the pullout of russian forces
4579065 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4579066 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4579067 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians

4579100 a little more expensive but a lot nicer than most nail salons
4579101 chris dude you got to go for the oatmeal bran cookie
4579102 se volete dare di nuovo un messaggio alloccidente deve essere un messaggio di
4579103 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4579104 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4579105 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4579106 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4579107 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4579108 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4579109 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4579110 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4579111 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4579112 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4579113 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4579114 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there
4579115 this is a sad case because its obvious that you have considerable skills and talent and you did have the trust and good will of this entire community
4579116 and tragically instead of fulfilling your promise you took the wrong turn you made wrong decisions
4579117 in the process you destroyed the most valuable asset you possessed your good name
4579118 by far has been the toughest year in my life
4579119 but its also been a good year in the sense that ive been able to find the person who my parents raised again
4579120 each day i tell my children to be good and do good and be careful of the decisions you make because they carry a consequence regardless of intent youll be held accountable for the decisions that you make
4579121 thats how i was raised and somewhere along the way i lost my path and ive made horrible decisions for which i assume full and complete responsibility
4579122 i dont regret having been caught and the things that i did and those kinds of things as much as i have remorse in my heart for the decisions i made and the impact they have had on others
4579123 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4579124 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4579125 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4579126 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4579127 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4579128 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had

4579133 el descontento de los damnificados por el sismo afectar la popularidad del presidente alan garc a
4579134 gays and lesbians are born that way and can do nothing about it
4579135 are the ultimate authority to guide the moral direction of their children without interference by an increasingly activist school system
4579136 according to the american psychiatrist association there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological cause for homosexuality
4579137 homosexuals do not reproduce they recruit and many of them are out after my children and your children
4579138 it has come to my attention that you are not performing your duties as an animalia chordata mammalia lagomorpha leporidae sylvilagus
4579139 you didnt understand a word i said did you bugs
4579140 that is all well and good but do you know what you are supposed to do
4579141 no no no bugs a rabbits number one job is to make more rabbits you see if i have to keep making rabbits i will be so busy i wont have time to enjoy heaven and earth and i may have to create a place to put things that irritate me like hell
4579142 gosh i wouldnt want you to do that god what can i do
4579143 you must make more rabbits bugs you must reproduce if you do not reproduce you will be an aberration something that does not reproduce you dont want to be an aberration do you bugs
4579144 this visit will help us find together the way of peace for the good of all humanity
4579145 i empathize with the school with the teacher with the superintendent theyre working with some misinformed members of the community
4579146 it is prohibited to attend the actual funeral ceremonies of non muslims
4579147 please note that children spend most of their active lives at schools
4579148 and they will be affected regardless where they are you really dont want to hear your daughter coming to you when she is 13 years old to tell you that she has a date and i can almost guarantee you that someone will propose to her dont make it hard on her by putting her in an environment that encourages immoral behavior
4579149 it is wrong to say that islam teaches us to respect the religious beliefs of non muslims
4579150 to respect the beliefs of others means to respect kufr and shirk this it totally unacceptable
4579151 they may practice their religion within the privacy of their homes they may not build any new churches or synagogues etc they may not celebrate any religious festivals in public they may not display in public any item having particular religious pupport e g bible cross statue etc they may not ring the church bell nor read their religious books so loud that it is audible in public
4579152 are we going to be open to a variety of different perspectives versus are we going to limit and censor and shut down the educational experience and investment to keep out people with certain views
4579153 public school teachers are subject to the establishment clause of the first amendment which is designed to ensure that government remains neutral
4579154 we wholeheartedly subscribe and adhere to the principles that we should not allow the faith of our students to be impacted by the preferences of their teachers
4579155 students are not in school to be recruited by religious groups
4579156 the separation of church and state is basic to protecting the independence of both and must be maintained
4579157 with our blood with our soul we will sacrifice for you christ
4579158 carlos was a very dependable and loyal employee who provided much value to the running of the undergraduate chemistry laboratories throughout his many years of service
4579159 the ensuing partnership is a positive and beneficial one for organizing students in a thoughtful and thought provoking discussion of often controversial issues
4579160 the panel was intended to discuss with students the risk of engaging in certain behavior
4579161 i am going to encourage you to have sex and encourage you to use drugs appropriately
4579162 why i am going to take that position is because you are going to do it anyway i think as a psychologist and health educator it is more important to educate you in a direction you might actually stick to
4579163 its very natural for young people to experiment with same sex relationships perhaps they dont talk about it much a lot of people experiment and dont go on to be homosexuals
4579164 i would also vote for the legalization of most drugs i happen to live in the state of california in the city of los angeles which has been described as americas amsterdam
4579165 there are therapists that work with their clients under the influence of ecstasy if i had some maybe i would do it with somebody lsd was my drug of choice in college
4579166 some of the things that were offensive were that i think it is inappropriate to discredit religious views on these issues i know mr becker that you discredited abstinence when it is something that people feel strongly about i just wanted everyone to know that there are two sides to this argument even though this has been one sided
4579167 could be a pervert who gets his jollies by talking about sex with minors
4579168 as a member of the university police department his leadership and professional skills earned the respect admiration and gratitude of people in every walk of life
4579169 mac dedicated himself to the safety of our community for nearly four decades
4579170 people who knew him would likely say he was a quiet man who led by example and possessed a strong will and dedication to professionalism he also was known as a person who had skill in conflict resolution i will be forever proud to say he was my friend
4579171 arab tradition and muslim tradition is geared toward an open mind
4579172 to me mrs stutzman was the model professional woman she was always very kind but very businesslike
4579173 i really admired her for the way she ran the office and presented herself i learned a lot from her and she was someone i tried to emulate
4579174 for a long time i have known that great institutions like the forest service and the university of chicago are run by five or six women behind the scenes for an even longer time i have known that you have been one of the five or six running the university of chicago what a great job you have done
4579175 she was an extraordinarily gentle and humane person who accomplished her work with grace and respect for all with whom she came into contact
4579176 the traditional muslims are the only people who are capable of stopping radical islam
4579177 america can decisively win this war by allying with traditional muslims and working with them to defeat the islamic radicals the best way for the right to make such an alliance is to convey to muslims that we share common ground with them on traditional values
4579178 many of them are just as zealous in their religious faith and practice as radical muslims
4579179 from those too who call themselves christians we make a covenant but they forgot and abandoned a good part of the message that was sent them so we estranged them stirred up enmity and hatred among them to the day of doom soon will allah show them the handiwork they have done
4579180 refrain from linking the case to the faith of islam
4579181 because of islamophobia millions of muslim in the western countries many of whom were already underprivileged in their societies for a variety of reasons are further alienated and targeted by hatred and discrimination
4579182 allah is not bound by any contract or treaty with non muslims nor is his apostle
4579183 qualquer medida para reduzir o escopo da petrobras tem que se repensada com cautela acho que a companhia tem que ser refor ada e n o enfraquecida

4579189 hes the world record so really were just chasing him
4579190 if the united states has nuclear weapons than why cant iran have nuclear weapons
4579191 were ashamed that the president of the united states is from texas
4579192 we would stone henry hyde to death and we would go to their home and kill their wives and children we would kill their families
4579193 the warmongers who stole the white house have hijacked a nations grief and turned it into a perpetual war on any non white country they choose to describe as terrorist
4579194 i am against theocracies in general i like democracy and diversity
4579195 i dare to think outside the small box of predigested bronze age myths
4579196 zionism was the nail in the casket of european jewry
4579197 the arabs protection is the only reason any holy sites remain in israel
4579198 it is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt
4579199 important artists are innovators whose work changes the practices of their successors
4579200 what they are counting on is that 20 000 reporters wandering around and chinas experience having hosted the world would perhaps lead the central authorities to realize they can afford greater tolerance and discourse without descending into chaos
4579201 that usually doesnt happen unless its the southern varieties around north carolina or tennessee
4579202 moreover since female attacks are considered especially shocking they are more likely to generate significant news media attention for both domestic and foreign audiences

4579233 ive always loved libraries and im fascinated with jewish culture
4579234 if the book is by a jewish author it can be on any topic whether it has a jewish theme or not
4579235 if the book is by a non jewish author whether it is fiction or non fiction the topic must have some jewish connection as long as it is not anti semitic
4579236 it will attract locals who are looking to improve their english the idea is to make the library the largest source of english language material in vilnius the study of english is very popular in lithuania now that it a member of the european union
4579237 and if they gain some familiarity with jewish culture and shed some prejudice along the way all the better
4579238 what better legacy to leave than a place of learning and education dedicated to fighting prejudice and intolerance
4579239 while i am like tevye in that i am not a rich man
4579240 it has been a pleasure spending what little money i have in buying books for the library
4579241 sir martin has agreed to donate a signed copy of each of the 79 books he has written or edited
4579242 i returned in 1995 and lived there for a full year both in 1996 and 1997 and 2001 and 2002 this year i lived in vilnius for over two months
4579243 another reason for choosing vilna is that it was a centre of jewish culture and learning in the first three decades of the 20th century there is a good reason it was known as the jerusalem of lithuania with more than 100 synagogues and prayer houses and with so many jewish newspapers it was a city which spread jewish thought around the world
4579244 vilna will be the cultural capital of the european union in 2009 and thus will be the focus of media attention it will be a perfect time to open up something jewish then i hope to open up a permanent location in 2010
4579245 non jewish lithuanians have voiced interest in and support for the library
4579246 the staff of the vilna gaon jewish museum the vilnius yiddish institute the jewish culture and information center and the principal of the jewish school have expressed support and so has the israeli embassy
4579247 i am not the king of the world and i can never end anti semitism but if i can open a few minds to the beauty of jewish culture i will have done my part to make the world a better place
4579248 the results from the second year of the demonstration have profound implications for shaping healthcare reform in america and only add to the growing body of evidence in support of coordinated care
4579249 as the voice of medical groups in america amga has been a champion of coordinated care and these results demonstrate once again the efficiencies and quality that can be found in multispecialty medical groups and other organized systems of care
4579250 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4579251 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

4579290 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4579323 the prophet said nobody who dies and finds paradise would wish to come back to this life even if he were given the whole world and whatever is in it except the martyr who on seeing the superiority of martyrdom would like to come back to get killed again in allahs cause
4579324 the message of islam is submit convert or die not salvation in jesus christ

4579329 in budapest hungary in 1956 radio free europe the american foreign propaganda network egged on the hungarians urging them to fight the soviet army and advising various methods of resistance
4579330 saakashvili could have read vivid accounts of broadcasts via the cia controlled radio free europe encouraging the hungarians in 1956 to believe that if they rose against the soviet occupier nato troops would race to their aid
4579331 an example of the united states unfortunate habit of giving much less powerful actors reason to believe that it will directly support them in times of trouble when it has no intention of doing so it happened in the hungarian uprising in 1956 when american backed radio free europe insinuated repeatedly that help fighting the soviet union was on the way

4579346 following this twisted trail of suspicious millions investigative reporters have drawn a line from obama to rezko to saddam husseins oil for food scandal with the key connecting point being billionaire nadhmi auchi
4579347 at rezkos trial the governments star witness stuart levine testified he attended a reception rezko held at his home for auchi on april 3 2004 levine further testified that barack and michelle obama attended the reception and met auchi as fully expected the obama campaign continued to maintain obama had never met auchi saying in effect that levine had committed perjury
4579348 if you have been following the tony rezko corruption trial several names are mentioned over and over obama stuart levine and illinois governor rod blagojevich are mentioned in the same sentence as rezko and chicago and illinois corruption governor blagojevich has not been indicted yet but many believe his indictment is probable the illinois legislature recently proposed a bill to allow the illinois people to recall the governor it was narrowly defeated the chicago tribune just came out with a story about blagojevich his strong ties to rezko and the possibility of his indictment

4579352 chinas decision to revoke joey cheeks visa undermines the spirit of the olympic games and chinas role as host as a world leader deeply engaged in africa and as host of the olympic games china has a responsibility and an opportunity to help bring peace to darfur i call on the chinese government to use the olympic games to push for an end to the conflicts in sudan and i call on president bush to raise this issue specifically with the chinese government during his visit
4579353 the chinese government has not provided any justification for revoking mr cheeks visa and i am concerned that this decision was a result of mr cheeks efforts to end the conflict in darfur
4579354 prohibiting mr cheek from attending the 2008 olympic games and supporting fellow athletes undermines the olympic principles of fair play and respect for all athletes that china has pledged to uphold i strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to revoke mr cheeks visa and allow him to attend the 2008 olympic games
4579355 in the coming days president bush will arrive in beijing i call on president bush to secure the entry of joey cheek and other u s citizens who have been barred from attending the olympics because of their beliefs advocacy for the people of darfur and human rights in china and tibet it is essential that president bush show leadership in promoting democracy freedom and human rights during his visit to china the olympic charter states that any form of discrimination with regard to a country of a person on the grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement the international olympic committee is tolerating clear violations of both the olympic ideals and the commitments the chinese government made in order to host the olympic games
4579356 i hope the chinese government is able to reconsider this
4579357 joey cheek is by no means an out of control radical hes a very serious sober responsible individual and his support for human rights certainly cant be in any way a detraction from the games
4579358 the chinese officials know of my involvement in the past and will hopefully give consideration to my request perhaps on a personal basis

4579363 we truly entered the bowels of kampala i have never seen anything like it there wasnt an inch of either sidewalk space or roadway space that you could see through the feet of the throngs of people or the vans and cars literally crawling inch by inch to their destinations i was terrified and excited to be there first of all i made the mistake of wearing sandals today of all days i thought for sure my feet would be run over by either a bicycle boda boda or taxi van and if that werent enough walking was perilous simply because of the outcropping of car mirrors which i ducked on at least three occasions i remember i kept thinking that i couldnt get hurt today i had a mountain to climb rosemary was fearless bound and determined to reach the place where she had a deal to buy maize flour for her children they needed food and that was all there was to it i rushed along behind her afraid that if i lost sight of her i would be forever lost and swallowed up when i got past my fear i was completely taken in by the life and activity going on all around me small stands selling goods people carrying their goods boda bodas carrying people people and more people i was having a blast rosemary half heartedly mentioned that it was too bad we didnt have time so she could introduce me to her father of course we had time and i excitedly told her she should lead the way the way of course was through more and more of the deep markets and people and cars and more cars and more people she stopped along the way to say hello to people she knew joan told me that this could take hours because rosemary knew everyone and more she laughed when she told me that she used to get exhausted when going with rosemary because their custom was to kneel at each introduction and all that getting up and down was tiring i laughed and she pulled me away when rosemary stopped so we didnt have to say hello my knee thanks her we reached his stand well inside an inside stall market reminded me of the arab market in the old city of jerusalem and he wasnt there we waited when he arrived i was introduced he didnt speak a word of english i shook his hand and did my version of a kneel rosemary and joan deeply kneeled before him we chatted well they chatted and i watched and i bought some pottery from him very cool meeting rosemarys father she was very proud we said goodbye and were off to buy the food more and more of the markets and stalls and people and cars after ducking a few more times squeezing through the car bumpers and learning to actually push through when necessary of course saying excuse me which fell upon deaf ears we reached the stall where the maize was to be purchased rosemary pointed out to me the motor they needed at the orphanage to produce this themselves i walked into the inner sanctum of maize production and took pictures she talked to the proprietor clearly she was a steady customer joan handled the transaction rosemary went off to hire the truck which would take the food up to kajjansi i was nervous as the bags were taken to the truck i was afraid they would steal it and then rosemary would be upset i need to get that trust thing in hand the truck was loaded and rosemary and i were off to the orphanage the ride was long because of traffic of course but also because six bags were very heavy and negotiating the roads if they can be called that was difficult for the driver but we arrived and were encircled by children as i got out of the car i was surrounded by reaching hands and appreciative faces and words they were thanking me for the food i didnt expect it and wasnt prepared i was flooded overwhelmed i wanted to stay there and play take it somehow away from the food and just be there with them
4579364 our nations advice for you is to get back to the path of monotheism justice and friendship at least in a bid to safeguard your own nations immediate and long term interests

4579369 she has been identified as one who has defamed the faith
4579370 if you come into the faith you must abide by the laws and when you decide to defame it deliberately the sentence is death

4579374 i can draw bigger ones i mean my intention of watching an anime is to see something fun and exciting not to see a gargantuan amount of circles if i wanted to see that id go to the olympics just the olympics arent fun and exciting
4579375 well everyone else is cosplaying it so i better watch it
4579376 the characters are so likable this alone is enough to give a reason just to watch this show they grow on the viewer and you actually care for what happens to them there is somthing about the characters that makes them seem belevable and realistic therfore you can relate to them all in some way or another they are all well developped in every aspect to the reason i gave the character 9 instead of 10 is because there is not enough of a variety of characters
4579377 in all actuality 51 episodes probably was a bit too short for fma by the end quite a few ends are left undone as they simply did not have enough airtime to be fully explained however while on the topic of the ending i say this bravo while not perfect it certainly merits recognition as most series often suffer a crippling much to be desired conclusion fma though a bit rushed ends with both originality and tact leaving a very open end for a sequel while at the same time properly ending fma as is
4579378 i always thought anime was a poor excuse of being independent since the fanbase around it is a complete turnoff both on the internet and in real life
4579379 oh he could do that special hidden technique using his left foot fingers
4579380 is not a major moral and political theorist whose work self evidently deserves and repays the most careful scrutiny
4579381 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
4579382 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4579383 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4579384 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
4579385 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4579386 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4579387 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use

4579389 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4579390 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4579391 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4579392 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4579393 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4579394 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4579395 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4579396 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4579397 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4579398 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4579399 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4579400 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity

4579402 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4579403 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4579404 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4579405 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4579406 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4579407 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4579408 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4579409 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4579410 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4579411 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4579412 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4579413 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4579414 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4579415 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
4579416 when youre a senator or youre elected president you take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
4579417 copyright derives directly from the constitution someone who is running for president needs to set a good example in adherence to the laws
4579418 instead of the smartaleck comments that are coming out of his campaign
4579419 what he ought to be doing is apologizing and letting the youth of america and everybody else in america know that they made a mistake
4579420 because running on empty is so famously associated with jackson browne essentially whats been misappropriated here is jacksons identity
4579421 theyve put it in a commercial in a way that says that jackson browne is supporting senator mccain
4579422 is you have an expert witness from the music publishing world talking about had jackson browne granted permission what would the license fee have been given his stature the famousness of the song and the use of it in this case jackson doesnt give permission for commercials which means the value had he done it would have been very high
4579423 the ohio republican party prepared the ad as an agent for and in concert with the national party and john mccain
4579424 ohio as you know is a key battleground state in the election and google lists plenty of examples of the close relationship between the national party and the ohio party our information and belief is that none of the state parties are sending stuff out that has not been approved by the national campaign and particularly in a key battleground state its inconceivable to us that this ad was done without the knowledge and consent of the mccain campaign
4579425 but i dont believe for a second that barack obamas campaign would have taken a jackson browne song and used it without his permission jackson has played concerts for barack obama they know each other

4579449 as you probably know i have been pretty quiet about the whereabouts of the band and the future and id like to inform you that we are on indefinite hiatus for now i feel that it is too early to continue or try to continue without vitek and or covan at this particular moment
4579450 regarding covan hes recovering now and needs all the time in the world to comeback to a normal life so i want to wait for him so we could both decide what the future will hold for
4579451 i definitely want to keep on playing and touring as its very important for me to keep on playing music while we have this break with

4579453 he took a big step forward as a nhl player last year and we look forward to even more progress in the future
4579454 coach mike babcock gave him the opportunity last season and jason took advantage of it holland said
4579455 he really established himself as an nhl player hopefully he can continue to build on that confidence
4579456 i dont want to say what statistics were expecting from him but there is an opportunity for someone to take a step forward offensively
4579457 in the end we felt if we could avoid arbitration wed both be better served

4579482 his latest flip flop proves he cannot be trusted to address americas energy crisis unless he is dragged kicking and screaming to do so
4579483 while energy traders on wall street artificially inflate the price of a barrel of oil connecticut families are paying the price at the pump until we wean ourselves off of our addiction to oil weve got to crack down on the market that is distorting the price of oil and hurting our economy
4579484 we cant drill ourselves out of this problem but the fact is there is land and offshore resources currently available to the oil and gas industry and they arent using it while they know that connecticut families are paying skyrocketing prices at the pump

4579822 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4579823 bring forward lessons things they have done that have made them more competitive
4579824 so its really a place to learn from other countries as opposed to just learning from one country everyone is learning from everyone else
4579825 then you see the importance of looking for opportunities to be more competitive in the hemisphere one way is free trade but there are a lot of other ways as well
4579826 build an integrated high performing economy in the americas that delivers prosperity for more and more people
4579827 were competing not just within the americas or between countries were competing with the entire global economy
4579828 and while were waiting to build in the americas high performing skilled work forces having talented people that are educated to compete the rest of the world
4579829 depend on the talent of our people the investments we make
4579830 single most important thing the u s government can do to make latin america more competitive in the global market
4579831 so much as it is hurting u s companies and workers whose export opportunities would be far greater were our trading partners to lower their tariff and nontariff barriers as required
4579832 cherry on top of the cake they are not the cake itself life goes on trade goes on
4579833 efficient and well managed companies with first rate products and services and a loyal customer base can surely benefit from
4579834 it means so much to our troops serving all over the world to see this kind of support coming from their communities
4579835 the military in a lot of ways is about community and local actions like this have a huge impact on morale
4579836 these are personal community based efforts and to have schools and young people taking part in them sends the message we this particular community we know what youre doing we know why youre doing it and were grateful
4579837 due to public safety concerns the hawthorne office is currently closed
4579838 service levels in many of the southern california offices are currently impacted due to reduced staffing also dmv offices will not be open on saturday august 16 2008
4579839 when we see a staff shortage in one or more offices we work immediately to rectify that
4579840 our dmv workers are incredibly demoralized and upset right now
4579841 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4579842 im speechless i think it started settling in a little bit after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4579843 breaking down the prizes and the future of this site
4579844 we are proud of you we are proud of you clap clap
4579845 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
4579846 these allegations made by the onion are totally irresponsible and without any basis
4579847 at this point my administration has no intention of rigging the election in favor of john mccain because we are planning on creating an emergency crisis in order to cancel the elections altogether i am going to remain president into the foreseeable future
4579848 by not having an election at all this would certainly disarm those critics they should be satisfied knowing that there will be no election fraud
4579849 this should also satisfy conservative republicans who see john mccain has being too liberal on some issues they will get president bush for another term instead
4579850 but the question is how long will it take and how many casualties will we have
4579851 if we are on defense with a democratic president we will have more losses and it will go on longer
4579852 i listen a little to the democrats and if one of them gets elected we are going on defense
4579853 we will wave the white flag on iraq we will cut back on the patriot act electronic surveillance interrogation and we will be back to our pre sept 11 attitude of defense
4579854 the democrats do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against us
4579855 this war ends when they stop coming here to kill us
4579856 never ever again will this country ever be on defense waiting for terrorists to attack us if i have anything to say about it and make no mistake the democrats want to put us back on defense
4579857 hate us and not because of anything bad we have done it has nothing to do with israel and palestine they hate us for the freedoms we have and the freedoms we want to share with the world
4579858 the freedoms we have are in conflict with the perverted maniacal interpretation of their religion
4579859 freedom for women the freedom of elections freedom of religion and the freedom of our economy
4579860 we are not giving that up and you are not going to take it from us
4579861 i princip kan alla se kanalen men alla kanske inte har hittat den

4579871 these are the people that wiped out one of the most profound changes in the balance of the media is when the conservatives got rid of the equal time requirements and the result is that they have been able to squeeze down and squeeze out opinion of opposing views and i think its been a very important transition in the imbalance of our public eye
4579872 arrested for violating a closed military zone and for attacking two border police officers
4579873 there are some things a young person should never have to know or feel like the sharp retort of a bullet discharging from a hostile soldiers gun the smash of a hard boot or rifle butt against ones skull or the cool point of a machine gun barrel pressed into ones flesh kingstons victor macdiarmid a 23 year old university of toronto student experienced all of it in the last month while volunteering in the west bank for a palestinian led group thats protesting against israeli occupation of palestine

4579877 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4579878 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4579879 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4579880 it went extremely well and we are delighted that the norwegian guard honoured nils olav with a knighthood
4579881 we all enjoyed the occasion and nils was a perfect penguin throughout
4579882 we are extremely proud of nils olav and pleased that an enduring part of the

4579884 it was obvious the car had been crashed into but i still got a fine its unbelievable that the attendant had the gall to issue one
4579885 i was given little chance of surviving i had a belly so big i could balance a pint on it
4579886 they had me taking nine tablets every day but they werent helping me so i stopped taking them and started walking instead i have never looked back
4579887 all the fish and chip bars in weston are great so we like to have a change and eat somewhere different every day
4579888 i didnt want to know who took them i just wanted to make sure they came back no questions asked
4579889 im not going to speculate on who they were in the spirit of friendship
4579890 we havent stepped up security if you try to have a fortress mentality in the village youve lost the plot
4579891 on nov 10 2004 apple ceo steve jobs had a strained conversation with tim bucher one of the companys engineering executives according to a lawsuit later filed by bucher jobs said people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company bucher was stunned hed been promoted only a few months earlier bucher left apple but soon sued for wrongful termination he says the charges of mental illness are completely false apple settled the suit in 2005 and declined to comment for this story
4579892 now bucher is again squaring off against his former company hes spearheading an ambitious plan at dell to break apples dominant hold on the digital entertainment market he wont challenge apple head on with ipod knockoffs or a dell version of the itunes music store instead buchers 120 person team is trying to create a potent alliance among apples many rivals from cell phone makers and record labels to online music sites
4579893 the idea which dell plans to unveil as early as september is to create a broad standard more open than apples that will give people greater choice in how they buy and consume music movies and podcasts
4579894 central to dells plan is software acquired a year ago when it bought zing the company bucher founded after leaving apple the software handles behind the scenes translations so that content can be zinged between computers and other compatible devices dell hopes to announce the zing software as a feature on small cheap laptops expected in september and to have the software installed on all of its consumer pcs by the end of the year two portable media players are scheduled for early next year according to three sources bucher confirms that new devices are coming but he wont discuss details
4579895 dont want to kill the ipod you want to compete effectively in a space that was defined by the ipod
4579896 it would be very easy to break the apple strangle hold
4579897 im going to f ing bury that guy i have done it before and i will do it again im going to f ing kill google
4579898 the software handles behind the scenes translations so that content can be zinged between computers and other compatible devices
4579899 hes spearheading an ambitious plan at dell to break apples dominant hold on the digital entertainment market

4579902 i heard about facebook and wanted to know what it was about i love being online and it beats writing with a pen

4579908 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4579909 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4579911 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4579912 im not sure why he mentioned it to me but he asked me to i think find out if you had any business contacts in phoenix with respect to his son
4579913 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion
4579914 i feel rex has made improvement like the rest of our ballclub has
4579915 were not ready for the first game yet and you shouldnt be we dont want to necessarily peak yet we have three more games
4579916 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
4579917 those two are battling for a starting job i can remember just battling for a job if you dont play the best game of your life here then you probably dont have a job next week
4579918 in terms of a football career it was life or death
4579919 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates
4579920 im excited youre working with the guys who will be playing in the games its great
4579921 obviously we were a little disappointed in that first drive against k c
4579922 we did run a vanilla defense i think were going to open up our package a little bit more this weekend we definitely want to have a different feeling than we did after the kansas city game
4579923 they had reached an advance stage of readiness and what remained only was to set the zero hour for their attacks
4579924 they had the personnel the money the arms almost all the elements for terror attacks were complete except for setting the zero hour for the attacks
4579925 sent to other countries to study flying in preparation for using them to carry out terrorist attacks inside the kingdom
4579926 the thousands of young men and young women who have studied here have been taught some fundamental truths among these is that the freedom guaranteed them as citizens of this great country is the freedom to dream and aspire without limit and the freedom to fulfill their dreams and aspirations without interference that our countrys greatness is the result not of government benevolence but rather of individual initiative and enterprise and that responsibility is the counterpart of independe can you give that a great big amen
4579927 the entanglement of the federal government in the financing of colleges and universities and the consequent regulation of these institutions by federal agencies violate the idea of limited government embodied in the constitution such violations are inherently corrupt as seen in attempts by the department of education to force hillsdale college to count its students by race in direct violation of the noblest principles of the college and of america hillsdale college will continue zealously to defend and uphold against all threats and inducements its independence from federal government regulation and the administration of hillsdale college with the support of the board of trustees will continue to provide not only the finest liberal arts education but also national leadership in promoting the principles of liberty across the land and it will pursue these aims in strict avoidance of all subsidy from the federal taxpayer
4579928 the revolving door of republican politicians moving in and out of top political offices and washington d c lobbying firms thats republican presidential candidate fred thompson for years acting wasnt the law amp order stars profession it was a hobby in the real world thompson has made a fortune in a decades long career as a washington lobbyist and just this month as part of his role as the ultimate washington insider thompson offered to host yet another fundraising event for scooter libbys legal defense fund thompson has been vocal in his support of libby saying that he would absolutely pardon him as he runs for president hell try his hardest to hide the truth from the american people and we need to stop him support our efforts to get the truth out about fred thompson
4579929 they called a week later and said it was approved we were surprised that they gave us what we wanted

4579932 my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has looked upon his lowly servant from this day all generations will call me blessed the almighty has done great things for me and holy is his name he has mercy on those who fear him in every generation he has shown the strength of his arm and has scattered the proud in their conceit he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and has lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty he has come to the help of his servant israel for he remembered his promise of mercy the promise he made to our fathers to abraham and his children for ever
4579933 he casts down the mighty from their thrones and raises up the lowly
4579934 marc no one seems to know the answer to this one so sync is my last hope
4579935 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4579936 we use ip to allocate value and create incentives in society
4579937 just like many other powerful tools ip can be very useful but it can also be difficult to work with you can easily shoot yourself in the foot with intellectual property if you dont understand how and why this tool works
4579938 in fact i would argue that for most businesses in the united states the intellectual property part of the business is the most valuable part of the business
4579939 we are starting to see a swing away from stronger intellectual property protections and towards more openness and collaboration
4579940 people frequently have the mistaken impression that open source or free software is the opposite of intellectual property that is absolutely wrong
4579941 open source software open source because of the way it is structured vis vis the ip laws
4579942 clear correct and deep this is a welcome addition to discussions of law and computing for anyone even lawyers
4579943 everybodys got a different philosophy coming from a family of brothers we fought a lot and i love my brothers these guys are family and they fight so it doesnt bother me too much when they fight heat of battle two a days thats the enemy right now for the next two weeks i talked to those guys hard about not hitting each other in the head especially if they lose their helmet if the helmet comes off instead of hitting them in the head we asked them to just choke them that way we figured we could get em off before they killed em

4579947 a democracy is always temporary in nature it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always vote for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy which is always followed by a dictatorship

4579963 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by dictatorship the average age of the worlds greatest civilizations has been 200 years these nations have progressed through the following sequence from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to complacency from complacency to apathy from apathy to dependency and from dependency back into bondage

4579966 je ne peux accepter que pour des motifs id ologiques on coupe pour faire des conomies de 23 millions de dollars des programmes jug s performants dans le pass par ladministration conservatrice
4579967 je ne crois pas que ce soit uniquement pour des raisons financi res le gouvernement canadien fait des exc dents astronomiques
4579968 there goes my rationale for supporting the republican party doesnt really matter to me who wins now
4579969 the buzz rewards program is a token of thanks and gratitude to our members for their continued support this program is truly one of a kind as none of our competitors offer anything similar in the marketplace we at fare buzz are very excited about this new program and hope that our partners will make the best of it
4579970 our firm has been providing fundraising and leadership development services to nonprofits for more than 12 years the nonprofit community has been good to us we want to give back when it needs us most
4579971 translated into practical terms we will help nonprofits particularly the small ones at a cost they can afford
4579972 its on the honor system they tell us what they can afford we will help them
4579973 ik zou graag zo rijk zijn dat ik een paar racepaarden kon hebben windhonden zijn betaalbaarder
4579974 toen ik begon waren er de hondenraces de bioscoop en dansavonden nu is er zoveel meer te doen
4579975 en wat zelfs mijn dierbare labour party moest doen het imago van de sport voor de arbeidersklasse afschudden en een meer welvarende client le aantrekken het heeft een tijdje geduurd maar we beginnen resultaat te zien
4579976 als kijkers gewone mensen zich op straat zien uitspreken over een nieuwsonderwerp denken ze oh die meneer vond het belangrijk dan is het voor mij waarschijnlijk ook relevant
4579977 mensen bleken associaties te hebben die niet direct met de kernboodschap van het nieuws te maken hadden
4579978 ze leggen links naar priv omstandigheden die vaak niet relevant lijken denken bijvoorbeeld bij een bericht over lerarentekorten aan een vriendin die ook in het onderwijs zit en die ze nodig weer eens moeten bellen in hetzelfde item kwam ook een meneer duif aan het woord wat bij n proefpersoon aanleiding was voor een gedachtestroom over pluk van de petteflet
4579979 wat helpt is nieuws dichter bij de kijker brengen dat kan op verschillende manieren voor veel mensen is de oorlog in georgi een ver van mijn bedshow sommigen weten niet eens hoe je georgi fatsoenlijk uitspreekt je zou mensen kunnen wijzen op de consequenties van het conflict een hogere gasrekening
4579980 het is onze taak een zo breed mogelijk publiek van nieuws te voorzien
4579981 nieuws blijft het beste hangen wanneer je de kijker uitlegt waarom het voor hem of haar belangrijk is we hebben geen opvoedkundige taak we schieten ons doel voorbij als de kijker afhaakt
4579982 ik wil geen miep op de albert cuyp in het journaal horen ik wil een specialist met kennis van zaken
4579983 je zou je moeten schamen als je dat niet uit jezelf wil weten
4579984 honeywell moet met de billen bloot en ons een fatsoenlijk aanbod doen
4579985 we hebben hier in onze beste jaren met hart en ziel gewerkt en nu zetten ze ons als oud vuil aan de kant
4579986 elk jaar hoorden we bij de nieuwjaarstoespraak het gaat fantastisch goed we hebben weer winst gemaakt en nu draaien we opeens verlies
4579987 zeker omdat we zo dicht bij een akkoord met de bonden waren
4579988 dat zeiden ze vijf jaar geleden ook toen de verhuizingen naar tsjechi begonnen
4579989 het was altijd een hartstikke leuk bedrijf waar iedereen vol trots en met plezier werkte maar sinds vijf jaar is die sfeer behoorlijk omgeslagen er mag niks meer en er moet van alles ik ben nog net geen robot
4579990 ze hebben altijd goed aan ons verdiend met al die winst kunnen ze best een goed sociaal plan betalen
4579991 een goede ontslagvergoeding helpt natuurlijk om de vut te halen
4579992 maar ik vind een goede scholingsvergoeding minstens zo belangrijk met een certificaat krijg ik erkenning voor mijn technische vaardigheden
4579993 als ze bij sollicitaties naar diplomas vragen moet ik nee verkopen
4579994 all of the top bloggers in your niche pointing them to the post
4579995 volunteer to vote for any posts that theyre pushing on social media sites like digg del icio us and stumbleupon
4579996 join their private membership program like teaching sells and make lots of smart posts in the forums
4579997 the key is finding ways that you can be genuinely useful to them make yourself relevant and then use that opportunity to start building a relationship
4579998 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4579999 it has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds
