2460003 when you have something that works and sells as well as our monitor series it doesnt make a lot of sense to re invent it top to bottom
2460004 however if the r amp d team identifies something that can be improved even incrementally our philosophy is that such changes enhance the value of the product paradigms customers and dealers deserve the best value possible and thats what monitor series v 6 is all about

2460067 the gas from the corrib field will provide 60pc of the countrys gas requirements for the next 20 years perhaps the protesters would prefer if this country continued to buy more than 90pc of its gas from britain with the consequent huge price increases that we are about to experience

2460112 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2460113 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2460114 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2460115 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2460139 following the ati acquisition amd increased its investment in the professional graphics business and now delivers professional graphics accelerators that perform better than the competition at every price point the new ati firepro brand communicates this focus on performance and features that matter to engineers and designers
2460140 ati has been known for delivering value priced solutions for cad and dcc professionals the product reviews over the past year have validated the fact that ati offers outstanding application performance as well
2460141 historically 3d technologies were expensive and used only by senior designers within a large manufacturer or architectural firm as technologies advanced and prices dropped 3d graphics for entry level cad designers was no longer a pipe dream but a necessity
2460142 todays entry and mid level cad users need to create and render more complex designs and models and graphics accelerators from amd can deliver the performance and reliability professionals need at a price where 3d becomes the rule not the exception
2460143 our customers need high performance graphics hardware that is stable reliable and compatible with eyeon fusion and eyeon generation to foster increased collaboration while enabling more complex work
2460144 based on our experiences with amd we are confident that ati firepro 3700 and 5700 can be utilized in unique clustering configurations to meet the specific needs of our visual effects customers and certainly those of the film industry overall

2460161 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
2460162 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
2460163 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
2460164 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
2460165 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
2460166 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
2460167 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
2460168 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
2460169 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
2460170 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
2460171 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
2460172 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president
2460173 in his first race for office seeking a state senate seat on chicagos gritty south side in 1996 obama effectively used election rules to eliminate his democratic competition
2460174 knock out your opposition challenge their petitions destroy your enemy right it is how barack obama destroyed his enemies back in 1996 that conflicts with his message today he may have gotten his start registering thousands of voters but in that first race he made sure voters had just one choice

2460196 through the course of our lives we are fortunate enough to receive a multitude of amazing gifts gifts which though through another s hard won sacrifice we freely call our own the majority of the time we fail to express our gratitude to these selfless heroes and it is for that reason that generations of men and women serving our armed forces go unnoticed yet these men and women have given life limb and all the creature comforts of home to ensure that liberty and all its freedoms should never fail for you for me

2460200 one of the most fragile and important ecosystems in europe is found here in asturias some coral reefs have already been damaged by fishing gear but highly valuable colonies still exist these areas are in need of urgent protection in order to ensure the survival of hundreds of species
2460201 in spite of the richness of its seabeds the cantabrian is one of the least protected marine areas in europe the overexploitation of its resources and the lack of protected areas give cause for concern the spanish government and all the autonomous regions of this sea must make an effort to comply with international commitments and accelerate the creation of new reserves in which vulnerable ecosystems and endangered species can recover
2460202 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs

2460320 i think people tend to expect a certain sound from us
2460321 but on this record we tried to throw them for a loop
2460322 we went into the studio with an open mind thinking lets do whatever it takes to get these songs to the next level because we really have a lot of music inside of us and a lot of different places we can go
2460323 it feels very much like weve done it just the five of us theres been nobody else in the room
2460324 theres still lots of light and shade on it theres just a lot of things going on theres been some not so great stuff and some amazing stuff just in terms of the families that are growing up in the band the babies are turning into little boys now and everybodys happy in that respect

2460326 millions of christians live in a sentimental haze of vague piety with soft organ music trembling in the lovely light from stained glass windows their religion is a pleasant thing of emotional quivers divorced from the will divorced from the intellect and demanding little except lip service to a few harmless platitudes i suspect that satan has called off his attempt to convert people to agnosticism after all if a man travels far away from christianity he is liable to see it in perspective and decide that it is true it is much safer from satans point of view to vaccinate a man with a mild case of christianity so as to protect him from the real disease
2460327 oh no its affecting me i feel a slight tingling in my fingers
2460328 island come and see the landlords daughter youll not feel the drowning
2460329 the beautiful south have split up due to musical similarities the band would like to thank everyone for their 19 wonderful years in music
2460330 when we were tracking it i felt like we were really onto something that sounded like us i didnt want it to end so i extended the sessions so we could finish what we were doing and get that statement onto tape while we were in the zone
2460331 you never know where your records going to go when you step into the studio
2460332 youve got a few songs that youre pretty sure youve got to get on the record because they sort of define where youre going at the moment but other than that you never know which songs are going to work and which songs arent going to work so youve just got to have a lot of them and youve just got to play and see how it goes in the studio it becomes like another performance but its happening in the studio the band sets up and you just play live and see what happens
2460333 thats how rock n roll started thats how it was always at its best and thats how its going to continue to be great fitting into commercial radio formats is not how we want to make music
2460334 theres just not enough money in this business to do something that you dont believe in
2460335 if the industry doesnt know what to do with us thats the good news i remember someone saying that if youre parents like what youre doing then youre doing something wrong as far as rock n roll goes i guess its kind of a similar idea to that
2460336 i realized one day when we were on the road the career has already started
2460337 with each record were gonna keep trying to define whatever it is were trying to define and were gonna stumble along the way somewhere im sure were going to make some bad records as we go along or there are going to be some bad tracks that for some reason we need to put on the record when youre making records youve got to just put them out and then make the next one and keep going
2460338 for once in your life try to fight for something you believe in
2460339 denton is a very curious place its a place where music for some reason is the lifeblood of these people their main form of expression
2460340 everyone knows everyones business but not in an intrusive way perhaps because texas is so huge theres a real sense of small town togetherness within this huge expanse of land and for some reason everyone i keep getting recommendations about from there is talented gracious and good company
2460341 the kind of building you imagine horses and carts and civil war cavalry swarming around
2460342 but it still looks like its a building in the wild west doesnt it
2460343 everyones always eager to see and hear whatevers going on
2460344 people come here to study and then they stay its a nice town cheap and with enough musicians to keep things going
2460345 i still could finish my degree if i wanted to
2460346 but i got disillusioned we all did but it doesnt matter there are so many people like us dentons a town of pretty happy music school dropouts
2460347 to play jazz properly youve got to immerse yourself in it i used to listen to jazz two or three times a day and for hours now i listen to it two or three times a year
2460348 studying jazz just becomes pointless after a while nothing really extraordinary to me anyway has been made in jazz since the 70s and realising that became a huge point of frustration
2460349 not a lot of people listen to jazz in that way
2460350 how we play and produce is still very important to us were all concerned about the arrangements and the musical balance
2460351 music like that just gets me its music that stays with you
2460352 uh uh but in the last few years its all gone like this
2460353 that you need to know about denton people come here because theyre compelled to make music not because theyre compelled to make it
2460354 you see it was the only workers i could get
2460355 theres a lot of free stuff out there so its like with anything how does fee compete with free
2460356 what weve found is adult users like television and they like the high quality video big screen format that can be located in the bedroom and its a perfect platform to watch with a partner
2460357 for us the big issue on the internet side is all these free tube sites and that hurts the broadcasting internet and dvd sales when you have all of these people putting up these sites stealing content and giving it away for free
2460358 what that tells us is that consumers are willing to pay a premium for television content but not premium internet content
2460359 the internet may provide a better value proposition for consumers theres a lot of free sites out there but those looking for more quality look at cable
2460360 i think watching tv online is a gateway to the future but im not so sure that its the way of the future
2460361 we always want our services available wherever and however so that you can get it and subscribe to the channel
2460362 you can get playboy tv on demand and watch what you want to watch when you want to watch it or watch the linear feed
2460363 we want to work with operators to tie in our internet product on their high speed platform and use that to sell to the consumer the ability to either watch the product on your tv set or the internet but to have it all go through that operator
2460364 thats the goal and theres an opportunity to expand that
2460365 if you go to any of those sites youll see they borrow from each other tremendously
2460366 our business is getting you to subscribe to playboy tv so well use those sites to promote our service
2460367 we try to do business with them we send traffic to them they send traffic to us its a very open community and everyone works together at the end of the day youre competing for the consumer dollar but its not a cutthroat business if you can send business my way and i can send business your way and we both make money great thats how it works in the internet world

2460384 we have a lot of people in these watersheds and very little forest cover left

2460398 the fire department told me when they came that if the alarm hadnt worked wed be dead
2460399 we more than anyone else want to make sure we dont have these
2460400 we dont hesitate to remove or replace an appliance if we feel that its a cause for concern its not a matter of trying to get another month or a year out of a stove

2460403 would stretch from here to the hillendale golf course and back
2460404 the story goes that fred sheaffer went out to pimlico one day and put some money on a horse
2460405 when my father and mother came into the business they made it into a restaurant all the recipes came from my mother who had opened her first restaurant when she was 21
2460406 and after mr sheaffer who was known as freddy died in 1960 they became sole owners
2460407 he was always on the phone working the books and was still doing it two weeks ago he loved it

2460409 people from the news american were in there all times of the day when i was working on the paper in the 1960s i didnt have much money for food and would go in there for a coke
2460410 bill knew i liked pork roll and cheese sandwiches and before i knew it hed send one over and wouldnt charge me for it
2460411 when bill wouldnt take my money i went to his wife and she said bill has a rule you dont pay then i went to his daughter and she said the same thing
2460412 we used to go there for the fried chicken and it was awfully good it was a very comfortable and relaxing place
2460413 bill was always a pleasure to be around and you cant be in business as long as he was without doing something right

2460435 the dalai lamas supporters are taking children en masse from remote villages in nepal
2460436 the central tibetan administration has never ever supported or encouraged such kind of en masse recruitment of nepalese children in its schools and institutions nor do we have the resources and facilities to maintain them given the large number of young tibetans who escape out of tibet every year to pursue their education in exile which they are deprived of in their own homeland
2460437 in fact there are reports about some disgruntled elements in the exile tibetan community who in the name of his holiness the dalai lama and the central tibetan administration are carrying out this mass recruitment of young nepalese children apparently to discredit and defame his holiness the dalai lama and the central tibetan administration

2460490 its impossible to always rise to the occasion but its important that when the spirit has you you work with it thats when you have something to say not because youre under pressure to prove to somebody that youre still here and valid
2460491 interrogate the tacit presumptions of common sense and provoke new ways of looking at a familiar world
2460492 some of the most trenchant social criticisms often expressed through difficult and demanding language
2460493 you wouldnt mock specialists in quantum chromodynamics just because their work can be difficult to follow so why dont you give theorists of rhetoric who are every bit as clever and important the same benefit of the doubt
2460494 the approved mode of expression for the society and values of the newly empowered middle class
2460495 interrogating the tacit presumptions of common sense and provoking new ways of looking at a familiar world
2460496 sugar kills think of the calories in sugar fat kills more people than anything else sugar is responsible for a lot of deaths arguably more than crack cocaine
2460497 guys many things but stupid isnt one of them can you really believe hes that passionate about sugar
2460498 coming from a man whose films are all about gangsters drugs and murders its his way of saying to his wife that shes not going to have it all her own way madonna will have to tread carefully if she wants to keep him onside until her tour is over
2460499 it was a huge gig for us and we got to headline
2460500 we didnt realise that peaches geldof was a presenter we hadnt a clue who the woman was
2460501 she was giving it the oh youre irish my dads irish routine and we were like okaay later we found out she meant her dad was bob geldof
2460502 thats not really recursive gt its building an external variable
2460503 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2460504 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2460505 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2460506 over the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic

2460510 we could refresh the look and feel of the entire desktop with moonlight
2460511 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2460512 tskhinvali is now under the complete control of our troops
2460513 today we have hit four russian fighter jets we have now hit 10 in total and captured a pilot
2460514 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2460515 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2460516 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2460517 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2460518 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
2460519 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development
2460520 were trying to learn how we can design roads and plan for roadways that are going to have less of an impact on snakes

2460528 this transmittal of information is to be accomplished by means of comprehensive hazard communication programs which are to include container labeling and other forms of warning material safety data sheets and employee training
2460529 i know which program will be last incentives let their paychecks be their incentive
2460530 im glad we started with the incentive program i can see how this program can be used to motivate participation in the other programs we are about to discuss
2460531 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track
2460532 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians
2460533 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
2460534 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
2460535 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
2460536 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
2460537 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
2460538 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
2460539 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
2460540 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
2460541 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them
2460542 we also have got bsnl lic life insurance corporation maruti lenovo amul itc and various other small advertisers but as far as olympics is concerned revenue generation is not our only target we want to take the event to every household
2460543 we are not sharing the feed as a policy with any other private sports broadcaster making money is not our main objective
2460544 honestly no targets have been fixed as far as generation of revenue during olympics is concerned advertisers are ready to invest in a sporting event like cricket but not in a vital event like olympics which is held once in four years in of any cricket based event we get calls from advertisers even before it starts but sadly its not the case with other sporting events
2460545 at least those advertisers who are spending millions on ground activity could have approached us we know that the situation is grim and we are ready to face it
2460546 we chose o amp m as they demonstrated their understanding of our business they have the right people passion and enthusiasm to provide the marketing support we need for cellucom brand in india
2460547 ik ben op weg naar het hof van koning arthur
2460548 om mijn heer arthur en mijn vrouwe koningin gwenivere en heel het gezelschap van de ronde tafel te zeggen dat wij op geen enkele wijze iets kunnen vernemen over de verblijfplaats van sir lancelot
2460549 ach mijn dierbare zonen toen uw vader sneuvelde liet hij mij vier zonen waarvan er nu twee gedood zijn en door de dood van mijn edele zoon sir lamorak zal mijn hart nooit meer blij zijn
2460550 dat mogen wij niet want wij zijn van koninklijk bloed van beide kanten en daarom moeder is het ons lot gevechten en nobele daden na te jagen
2460551 door u zal mij de lust vergaan en dan zal ik weer en wind niet kunnen weerstaan en wat van de dood van koning pellinor uw vader die schandelijk werd gedood door de handen van sir gawain en zijn broeder sir gaheris en zij doodden hem niet manhaftig maar door verraad helaas mijn lieve zonen dit is een droevige klacht van mij over uw vaders dood ook gezien de dood van sir lamorak die als ridder maar weinig gelijken had onthoud dit goed mijn lieve zonen
2460552 ik dien een goede ridder die sir aglovale wordt genoemd
2460553 omwille van sir aglovale zult u slecht logies krijgen want sir aglovale doodde mijn broeder en daarom zult u uw dood ontvangen als gedeeltelijke betaling
2460554 beste ridder hier ligt een schildknaap die afgelopen nacht schandelijk is gedood
2460555 de heer van dit kasteel gaf deze schildknaap afgelopen nacht onderdak en omdat hij zei dat hij dienaar was van een goede ridder die met koning arthur is en sir aglovale heet daarom beval de heer hem te doden en daarom is hij gedood
2460556 en u zult zijn dood spoedig gewroken zien want ik ben diezelfde ridder voor wie deze schildknaap werd gedood
2460557 dat ik sir aglovale hier ben voor wie zijn schildknaap vannacht werd gedood
2460558 zie hier ben ik maar waarom doodde u vannacht mijn moeders schildknaap
2460559 ik geef toe dat ik hem doodde omdat hij een valse ridder was en een bedrieger van dames en goede ridders en voor de dood van mijn schildknaap
2460560 sta op en maak u gereed want u en ik zullen stilletjes wegrijden
2460561 ik wil graag met u rijden waarheen u maar wilt maar als mijn heer uw broeder me snapt zal hij me vermoorden
2460562 maak u daarover niet bezorgd want ik zal borg staan voor u
2460563 we got a call stating there were shots fired in the area of pine street and then we received a call that a man had come into the hospital with a gunshot wound
2460564 all the time they were telling us they might not go forward with a runway extension they were putting together documents and doing it
2460565 its hard to believe that all this could be done in the space of a month
2460566 like the people running the airport have no idea whats going on
2460567 it reopens the door that city manager gary oconnell had really slammed shut so that the public can consider the benefits of pairing the reservoir dredging with the runway extension
2460568 but its sad in a way because its indicative of the state of the economy
2460569 the last time we had more than three or four
2460570 we have no idea whether it will receive full partial or no funding
2460571 it keeps alive the idea of using fill for the rest of it
2460572 i think its important not to mix the two together
2460573 decides where they get the fill that meets faa standards
2460574 the reporter never bothered to call us to ask for verification or comment
2460575 its even more egregious because its about someone whos deceased and cant defend himself
2460576 is that they connected what falwell was marketing with falwell himself the developer to whom he sold the land lost 20 million and declared bankruptcy but he hadnt invested in it nor did his ministry
2460577 the deal was that liberty university would have gotten either 2 5 percent of each sale or 10 percent of the net income whichever was larger
2460578 i am surprised how could the makers pass off such sub standard stuff to the audiences
2460579 with all the costs going up we wanted to try and do more things to help raise funds theres a greater need with more people being laid off our dinner theater was a success and we thought what else could we do then we came up with the thought of making a mile of money out of quarters
2460580 this is our first year for this and i hope we can make a mile im optimistic
2460581 we want to thank the community with what we will raise without their support we couldnt do what we do maybe we can also try it again another day and we plan to make it an annual event
2460582 its great the community is reaching out for a good purpose the more donations we get the more people we can help
2460583 its a competition to see who can raise the most money in the buckets and it means a lot to help the community
2460584 the salvation army approached us and i thought it would be a good idea to do this during the summer to help them out with projects
2460585 its a neat fundraiser and i hope next year we can get other businesses involved and do some competitions
2460586 we have everything in place to go and get him
2460587 we have detective randy ritchason and patrol officer joel tignor will be going down to get him we just need fort myers to get us the paperwork
2460588 we decided that with the gravity of the situation this is the way we feel we need to deal with this situation
2460589 effective tomorrow the board has suspended him without pay pending the outcome of the proceedings
2460590 the board talked about several different options and brought up several questions of concern with the options were going to look at what we feel is the best option
2460591 we would have to decide at the next board meeting if we want to offer two
2460592 what were looking at is the auditorium only a five year versus a permanent improvement and can they both be put on at the same time
2460593 even if its a 1 200 or 1 000 seat auditorium built old traditional style onto the new school
2460594 after this is over well be the most compliant restaurant in charlottesville
2460595 more likely than other violations to directly contribute to food contamination illness or environmental degradation
2460596 can create environments that cause bacteria to grow and thrive which puts the consumer at risk for food borne illness
2460597 closed due to accumulation of repeat continuing and flagrant violations of the regulations that could lead to food borne illness
2460598 you wont be leavin my arms ever i promise you that even if you want me to let go honey even if you want me to let go
2460599 dont you think i could tell that you were trying to trying to make a fool out of me
2460600 i didnt say i was powerful i said i was a wizard
2460601 if i could do these things if i could maybe do these things each and every day wouldnt pass the way that they so often do that they so often do maybe just maybe life would be everything we wanted it to be
2460602 i m not the one that you want i ll only let you down and i m pretty sure that you ve caught on and you can say that i m just feeling sorry for myself
2460603 the undertakers thirst for revenge is unquenchable the final battle

2460606 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
2460607 over the last few releases microsoft has introduced some major advances to the net framework that transform the way developers write managed applications
2460608 this book provides the brain upgrade you need to harness the full power of visual studio 2008 and net framework 3 5
2460609 health care services are relatively few and far between for rural people and many are accessible only in distant urban communities
2460610 we have substantial distances between small towns and we have substantial pressure on the community hospitals in those small towns
2460611 as people grow older and require additional medical care they need the assurance that there will be a health care facility located nearby and the type of care they receive will be affordable and of the highest quality possible
2460612 one of the big problems has been compensation under medicare
2460613 if theyre not recovering fully and fairly under medicare they dont have enough other patients to recover their shortfall
2460614 its a funding problem and its a staffing problem and ive heard that the staffing problem is even more acute than the funding problem
2460615 weve got an inadequate workforce in many parts of rural north dakota and yet weve got an increase in the number of people who need that workforce the most
2460616 we are pleased to have support from the leading brand airtel to extend our reach to millions of rock music enthusiasts in our country and give bands a bigger platform to launch their music for the first time ever we are coming to kolkata and pune with their support
2460617 its where i originally grew up and lived so im excited
2460618 we have no prospects at this time but were hoping to have some applicants i would like to be able to work with someone to bring them up to speed but i clearly have to move and get things going over in pennsylvania
2460619 this is kind of like when we lost meg deedrick former community development director you hate to lose them because they did great work
2460620 ive been giving stacy a crash course the last few weeks talking with her on a daily basis about upcoming projects
2460621 some of the qualifications are working for the fair being part of the programs acting as an advisor to us or offering financial support of the fair and the youth
2460622 randy fills a lot of those we had 50 people up for the awards and he came out on top
2460623 i wasnt anticipating it at all its a great honor for a person born and raised in ohio
2460624 we have a great working relationship with him that has developed over the years
2460625 im proud to have worked with him for 16 17 years he deserves this award
2460626 i did gardening and i didnt know anything about animals until i was 14
2460627 my wife was in 4 h and thats where she learned how to cook thats also where our daughter learned how to sew cook and raise lambs and hogs kids learn a lot of good people skills like how to deal with judges writing skills and a lot of good values
2460628 we had a vision to blend the red fm sound with a new tune which would maintain the essence of our bajaate raho attitude and offer a fresh and more fun sound for our listeners i believe we have managed to crack just the right sound which is foot tapping fun and also appeals to every one alike
2460629 every time you hear this song you will hear something different in it we have tried to make this sound different from the rest of the competition while at the same time not take it too far from the music that an average indian is used to
2460630 besides that since it was our id it had to be something that is totally bajaate raho and i think we have succeeded in doing just that if you hear the new tune you cant help but move to the music
2460631 oh good god you dont want to watch that rubbish turn it off
2460632 for a perfect steak i need the best meat available a properly prepared charcoal grill and the customers instructions
2460633 we are seeing a number of common types of cyberbullying quite regularly
2460634 these methods of bullying range from posting obscene insulting or slanderous messages on online social networking sites to malicious text messages sent via cell phones
2460635 this book provides timely research best practices and personal voices from students that will go a long way toward improving student safety
2460636 the evidence on processed meat is even more clear cut than that on red meat and the data do not show any level of intake that can confidently be shown not to be associated with risk

2460698 for persons with a documented absence of growth hormone administration of this hormone can help them to acheive normal stature but this is indicated only for persons clearly way below normal growth curves and a documented by lab tests deficiency growth hormone given after bones have stopped growing for example at 22 would be more likely to induce acromegaly this is a disease seen in persons that secrete too much growth hormone the symptoms are significant corsening of facial features hyperplasia of joints and severe arthritis
2460699 is a substance released by an organ or tissue that controls the activity of organs or cells in another part of the body
2460700 test overview human growth hormone gh is produced by the pituitary gland it is essential for growth and plays an important role in how the body uses food for energy a process called metabolism the amount of gh in the blood changes throughout the day and is affected by exercise sleep emotional stress and diet too much gh during childhood can result in excessive growth gigantism too little gh during childhood can inhibit growth dwarfism however gigantism and dwarfism can be treated if discovered early in adults excess gh is usually caused by a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma excess gh can lead to an abnormal bony enlargement of the face jaw hands and feet acromegaly growth hormone can cause the release of other substances factors that affect growth one of these is insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 when the gh level is abnormally high the igf 1 level is usually high as well a test for igf 1 may be done to confirm high gh levels see an illustration of the pituitary gland this test is done on a blood sample taken from a vein two blood samples taken 1 day apart may be collected why it is done a test for growth hormone gh is done to determine whether a child whose growth is abnormal has dwarfism or gigantism help determine whether an adult has acromegaly a condition usually caused by a gh secreting tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma monitor treatment that involves use of gh how to prepare fast and limit your physical activity for 12 hours prior to a test for growth hormone gh since physical activity can interfere with gh test results you may be asked to lie down and relax in a quiet room for 30 minutes before your blood is drawn certain medications can interfere with gh test results such as corticosteroids and estrogen including birth control pills your doctor may instruct you to stop taking these medications prior to this test talk to your doctor about whether these medications need to be stopped prior to the test recent diagnostic imaging procedures using a radioactive tracer such as a thyroid scan or bone scan can interfere with gh test results inform your doctor if you have recently undergone any test that used a radioactive tracer how it is done because the blood levels of growth hormone gh can change quickly more than one blood sample may be taken on different days the person drawing blood will wrap an elastic band around your upper arm to temporarily stop the flow of blood through the veins of your arm this makes it easier to put the needle into a vein properly because the veins below the band get larger and do not collapse easily the site where the needle will be inserted is cleaned with alcohol and then the needle is inserted into the vein more than one needle stick may be needed if the needle does not get placed correctly or if the vein cannot supply enough blood when the needle is properly placed in the vein a collection tube will be attached to the needle blood will flow into the collection tube sometimes more than one tube of blood is collected when enough blood has been collected the band around your arm will be removed a gauze pad or cotton ball is placed over the puncture site as the needle is withdrawn pressure is applied to the puncture site for several minutes and then a small bandage is often placed over it how it feels you may feel nothing at all from the needle puncture or you may feel a brief sting or pinch as the needle goes through the skin some people feel a stinging pain while the needle is in the vein however many people do not feel any pain or have only minor discomfort once the needle is positioned in the vein the amount of pain you feel depends on the skill of the person drawing the blood the condition of your veins and your sensitivity to pain risks there is very little risk of complications from having blood drawn from a vein you may develop a small bruise at the puncture site you can reduce the risk of bruising by keeping pressure on the site for several minutes after the needle is withdrawn rarely the vein may become inflamed phlebitis after the blood sample is taken phlebitis is usually treated with a warm compress applied several times daily continued bleeding can be a problem for people with bleeding disorders aspirin warfarin coumadin and other blood thinning medications can also make bleeding more likely if you have bleeding or clotting problems or if you take blood thinning medication tell the person before your blood is drawn results normal normal results may vary from lab to lab growth hormone men 0 5 nanograms per milliliter ng ml women 0 10 ng ml children 0 16 ng ml after physical or emotional stress such as exercise or worry about health problems growth hormone gh levels are normally about 20 to 30 ng ml greater than normal values may mean high growth hormone gh values may indicate gigantism or acromegaly these conditions are often the result of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland adenoma increased gh levels may also result from diabetes kidney disease or starvation what affects the test high levels of growth hormone gh can be caused by such medications as amphetamines estrogens including birth control pills levodopa larodopa dopar methyldopa aldomet propranolol inderal and bromocriptine parlodel low blood sugar can cause high gh levels low levels of gh may be caused by chlorpromazine thorazine and corticosteroids rough handling contamination or inadequate refrigeration of the blood sample can cause inaccurate test results what to think about newer more sensitive tests are being developed to measure human growth hormone gh since normal levels of gh can vary widely other tests may be done to confirm the results of a gh test additional tests can determine whether low levels of gh which can be normal mean the pituitary gland is not functioning insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 blood levels are commonly evaluated along with gh levels a high level of igf 1 along with a high level of gh is almost always diagnostic of acromegaly in this case magnetic resonance imaging mri studies should be done to evaluate the pituitary gland for more information see the medical test magnetic resonance imaging mri of the head the growth hormone suppression test also called the glucose loading test measures the level of gh in the blood before and after a person drinks liquid containing a large amount of sugar glucose normally the amount of gh drops to less than 1 ng ml after drinking the glucose levels of gh that remain high may indicate acromegaly the growth hormone stimulation test also called the insulin tolerance test measures the level of gh in the blood before and after insulin is given through a vein intravenously normally the amount of gh increases after the insulin is given in children the level should be more than 10 ng ml in adults it should be more than 7 ng ml a gh level that does not increase may indicate a gh

2460817 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2460818 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2460819 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2460821 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2460822 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2460823 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2460824 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2460825 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2460840 einstein came along a nd changed the whole newtonian view that space was just this absolute unchanging stage the arena of reality
2460841 what we have learned more recently is that there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that we need to change our thinking of space once again because we suspect that space is not a fundamental idea theres definitely a realm in which we can try to imagine a space less arena and by virtue of relativity that would mean a timeless arena i dont even know how to picture that if you ask me to picture a place without space that has no time it gives me a headache

2460845 i remember that mr gooch was nice and that he always wore a cap a red knit beanie
2460846 i remember when i was in kindergarten i got chased home by a dog and was scared to walk home from the bus stop anymore mr gooch made a special stop behind our house just to drop me off because i was scared also he was the brave bus driver we were at the bus stop when three goats were chasing us around so we all took refuge on top of a fence when the bus came mr gooch fought off the goats because they got on the bus as soon as the door opened he managed to get the goats off and us on safely
2460847 there used to be a boxing ring at the house where our bus stop was and still is at sand canyon and i remember that one afternoon mr gooch got out and jumped in the ring with us the todds the hamilton kids saderups riffenburghs and the chilcoats that was our neighborhood and there was the time a girl kicked me out of my seat and mr gooch came back and lectured her and then he put me in the seat right next to him
2460848 as a kindergartner i was so scared walking down my long dirt road all by myself save for all the dogs to reach my bus stop mr gooch was always so kind to me and would save me a seat up front beside him the special bonus was that he would let me hold the clicker so i could count how many kids got on the bus as we made our way through moonridge

2460933 sound approaches to evaluation including essays dictation and holistically scored oral interviews might well be neglected by persons eager to employ computers in language testing
2460934 the computer adaptive language test calt is uniquely tailored to each individual in addition calt is automatically terminated when the examinees ability level has been determined the result is a test that is more precise yet generally much shorter than conventional paper and pencil tests
2460935 there are several advantages of this calt the first is the ability estimates in calt tests are determined by the examinees pattern of responses this testing methodology results in increased measures at the individuals approximate level of ability which in turn provide for increased test accuracy improved test accuracy results in greater test efficiency meaning that fewer items are necessary to evaluate the students ability and consequently less time is required for testing

2461017 why does the family take it upon themselves to convert western girls who come here people should be able to choose why is it so rigid relationship is supposed to be free

2461030 the oil companies right now have 68 million acres of leases that they are not using

2461075 perhaps it can be said that seismic changes are taking place in malaysia because there has been no political renewal and special interest groups are entrenched perhaps the race based system which both lee and anwar challenged under which this group preserves its interests is no longer tenable in the age of the internet perhaps too many malays who support anwar now realise that malaysian malaysia or reformasi is what the country needs to lift the masses out of poverty not an astronaut or istanas if so then perhaps lee was right after all
2461076 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2461077 as the datuk seri anwar ibrahim saga unfolds before our eyes reflecting a similar episode 10 years ago it is strange that singaporeans do not experience a sense of deja vu not of the first episode but of aug 9 1965 while the absence of deja vu may be attributed to the passage of time of more than 40 years anyone who reads minister mentor lee kuan yews memoir a bestseller in singapore cannot fail to notice the parallels between lees battle against umno and anwars challenge against the same juggernaut
2461078 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2461079 it is something sad but happens in all divorce matters what i saw its not an issue of religion but how the people handled the matter the law is there the execution of the law is how its done per se its not an issue of conversion
2461080 but there is a twist in other court cases the pain and suffering is heard on both sides in this case because of the legal system where there are two jurisdictions the non converting spouse is confused and terrified thats why the heartbreak is exponentially increased in this situation
2461081 there is a problem and were trying to reconcile the differences trying to see whats the best way to move forward the problem will not go away unless we deal with it its a very human issue and as malaysians it is our responsibility to find ways to deal with it
2461082 apart from the legal issues we must focus on the humanitarian issues i think it is important to realise that saravanan subashini and shamala are not just names but real people
2461083 in malaysia religion is sensitive its not like in indonesia where they can marry freely like suharto hes muslim but his wife is christian in malaysia we have our federal constitution what they are doing is trying to destroy it
2461084 for me as a muslim i object to non muslims raising such a sensitive issue dont touch on the issue of religion thats a personal matter
2461085 its unfortunate that the forum coud not go on theres no conclusion for me its hanging
2461086 when you do a forum behind closed doors like this the people outside dont know who are on the panel they should have it outside like dataran merdeka
2461087 when you talk about people coming into islam there will be issues the people downstairs they dont know that
2461088 they make assumptions for those of us who are mature and educated we can think for ourselves but not everyone who came today are educated so they become very emotional because of this sensitive issue
2461089 so today there were political elements there were some people who did not give correct information
2461090 we can give our views on religion but the focus should not only be on islam
2461091 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2461092 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2461093 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2461094 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2461095 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2461096 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum its a real shame we had to stop the forum due to the advice from the police

2461099 with the economy as bad as it is gas prices going up home foreclosures and jobs being lost we need to be careful about who we pick as our next president
2461100 no doubt barack obama is a popular figure a celebrity who says the right thing but will he do the right thing
2461101 so heres the question you need to ask yourself in these tough economic times are you ready for a president who voted for higher income taxes on working families making 42 000 a year
2461102 are you ready for barak obama for his tax plans that will hurt senior citizens
2461103 are you ready for the higher taxes on income savings and the sale of your home that barak obama promises
2461104 its not that youre not ready barack obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it

2461122 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2461123 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2461124 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2461125 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2461126 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2461129 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2461130 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2461131 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2461132 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2461133 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2461134 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2461135 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2461136 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2461137 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2461138 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2461139 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2461140 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2461141 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2461142 intoarcerea la copilarie insa hai sa nu stam ca mai sunt de vizitat locuri multe
2461143 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2461144 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2461145 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2461146 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2461147 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2461148 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2461149 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2461150 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2461151 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2461152 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2461153 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2461154 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2461155 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2461156 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2461157 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2461158 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2461159 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2461160 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2461161 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2461162 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2461163 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2461164 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2461165 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2461166 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2461167 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2461168 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2461169 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2461170 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2461171 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2461172 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2461173 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2461174 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2461175 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2461176 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2461177 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2461178 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2461179 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2461180 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

2461183 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2461184 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2461185 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2461186 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2461187 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2461194 they would say i need a place of refuge i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience racism
2461195 churches should be interracial whenever possible because their success could ultimately reduce racial friction in america
2461196 the church was never meant to be segregated they point to the new testament description of the first christian church as an ethnic stew it deliberately broke social divisions by uniting groups that were traditionally hostile to one another
2461197 the first century christian church grew so rapidly precisely because it was so inclusive he says the church inspired wonder because its leaders were able to form a community that cut across the rigid class and ethnic divisions that characterized the ancient roman world
2461198 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
2461199 only when ethnic groups no longer feel compelled to abandon their entire culture on sunday morning can a church claim to be interracial

2461317 ayah sering menasihatkan kakak supaya berhati hati malah ayah sering menziarahi kakaknya di bandar baru bangi bagi memastikan keselamatannya
2461318 kakak menjadi juri dalam pertandingan itu dan dia tidak menyangka tindakannya membawa teman lelakinya itu mengundang rasa marah suspek kerana suspek pada masa itu sudah tidak ada sebarang hubungan lagi dengan kakak
2461319 kakak saya juga ada bertanya perkara itu kepada saya dan saya kata kakak harus mengikut kata hati
2461320 kakak akhirnya memilih untuk memutuskan hubungan dengan suspek kerana berpendapat tiada keserasian antara mereka
2461321 kakak kata badannya terasa lemah serta letih selepas mengendalikan pertandingan silat berkenaan
2461322 jika kakak sihat dia bukan sahaja akan pulang ke sini rumah keluarganya dan terlepas dari kejadian itu tetapi juga mungkin dapat melawan suspek kerana norzi ayu sudah mencapai tahap jurulatih dalam seni silat gayung yang disertainya itu
2461323 arwah kakak memang agak rapat dengan suspek kerana sama sama menyertai silat gayung
2461324 dia anak tidak bercakap banyak rapat dengan adik adiknya dan sentiasa berterus terang apabila menghadapi masalah
2461325 kakak saya juga ada bertanya perkara itu kepada saya dan saya kata kakak harus mengikut kata hati
2461326 kakak akhirnya memilih untuk memutuskan hubungan dengan suspek kerana berpendapat tiada keserasian antara mereka

2461330 hai orang orang yang beriman bersabarlah kamu dan kuatkanlah kesabaranmu dan tetaplah bersiap siaga di perbatasan negerimu dan bertakwalah kepada allah supaya kamu beruntung
2461331 sesungguhnya allah telah membeli dari orang orang mumin diri dan harta mereka dengan memberikan surga untuk mereka

2461333 lagunya memang menyayat hati tajuknya cinta tiga segi tetapi saya diberitahu ada judul lain untuk lagu itu
2461334 berdasarkan cerita beberapa rakan yang mempunyai lagu dan klip video itu ia mengisahkan seorang lelaki bernama hazwan yang dihukum gantung kerana membunuh bekas kekasih dan teman lelaki kekasihnya
2461335 kisah hazwan memang mengundang simpati kerana cinta dia sanggup membunuh dan ketika menunggu hukuman mati dia masih mengingati bekas kekasih
2461336 di kalangan rakan mereka mengingati lagu itu sebagai lagu banduan pasang saja lagu itu memang ramai tahu sambil mendengar lagu itu masing masing akan bercerita mengenai kisah di sebalik lagu itu
2461337 lagu itu saya cipta pada 1998 dengan judul perangkap cinta ketika di bangku sekolah saya masih hijau lagi dalam mengarang lagu kerana teringin sangat menjadi penyanyi
2461338 kerana ditinggalkan kekasih yang saya tunggu bertahun tahun saya menggunakan kisah hidup saya untuk mendapat ilham mencipta lagu itu
2461339 seorang rakan menyuruh saya merakam lagu itu supaya dia boleh menyimpannya di dalam komputernya dia memberi rakan perempuannya mendengarnya dan saya percaya dari situ mulalah merebak cerita mengenai lagu saya melalui perkongsian fail di komputer
2461340 seorang rakan saya lagi pula dihukum penjara kerana kes gaduh dan dadah dia pula menyanyikan lagu saya di penjara dan memberitahu saya waktu di penjara sesiapa yang mendengar memang suka lagu itu
2461341 tiada gunanya saya menipu saya tak makan duit daripada lagu itu dan saya tak inginkan nama untuk lagu itu
2461342 jika benar banduan itu menciptanya sila beritahu keluarganya supaya menghubungi saya secepat mungkin

2461397 its an adaptation of a very successful play from britain at this stage id rather not say more because someone is always there to pull the rug from under your feet
2461398 the hit play in britain was directed by a very talented guy called pravesh kumar and now ive hired him to direct my first feature film based on his own play

2461495 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2461496 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2461497 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2461498 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2461499 if u k is worried weve far greater reason to be worried
2461500 if the u k is worried we have far greater reason to be worried
2461501 the implications for india could be catastrophic even if the temperature were to rise by as much as two degrees celsius because our adaptive capacity is so low
2461502 unlike a developed country such as the u k which can mobilise adaptation strategies like building barriers against sea level rise india does not have the financial technological or institutional capacity to cope even with existing natural disasters let alone climate change which would trigger an increase in extreme weather events like droughts and floods
2461503 even though vast resources were made available for tsunami relief and rehabilitation not even one third of those who lost their homes have been rehabilitated and only a fraction of houses built for the victims have been occupied because they were either found to be architecturally inappropriate or sociologically incompatible
2461504 communities who depend on climate sensitive sectors such as dryland farming fisheries and forest resources will be worst affected
2461505 for instance parts of orissa and andhra pradesh could begin to see temperatures going up to 50 degrees and cities like bangalore will begin to experience temperatures of 40 degrees by the end of the century
2461506 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2461507 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2461508 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2461509 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2461510 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses
2461511 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2461512 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2461513 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2461514 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2461515 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2461516 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2461517 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2461518 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2461519 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2461520 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2461521 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2461522 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2461523 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2461524 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful

2461536 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2461537 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2461538 our peacekeepers and the units attached to them are currently carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2461539 mr saakashvili keeps saying that we want to chop off a part of georgian territory
2461540 hes also saying that this is not just about georgia this is about the future of europe because he says russia is also making territorial claims to other claims including the baltic states which is rubbish
2461541 we cannot allow the peace agreement just to be violated this way
2461542 whatever it takes to bring the situation to status quo ante will be done
2461543 its always a game we never quite use as a do or die thing we use it as a barometer for fitness
2461544 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2461545 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup last season
2461546 if im honest i think i love beating united more than i would love beating even arsenal
2461547 they need some minutes on the clock before the start of the season
2461548 the community shield is a prestigious match but i have used players in it who were not quite fit and we are more or less in the same situation again
2461549 they had a great season last year and now harry redknapp has brought crouch into the squad the partnership of crouch and defoe will be a handful for anyone now but hopefully we can cope with that
2461550 sunday is going to be a really difficult match but we will be fit and ready and hopefully we will give them a good game
2461551 its the first game of the season and all the new signings are out
2461552 alex hes outstanding the way he consistently produces great teams and has developed players as well as bought them i have the utmost respect for him
2461553 he is a great man at a great club but there is just something about him and them that i love beating
2461554 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2461555 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2461556 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2461557 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2461558 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2461559 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2461560 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2461561 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2461562 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2461563 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2461564 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2461565 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2461566 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2461567 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2461568 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2461569 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2461570 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2461571 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

2461573 the palestinian authority is interested in releasing the biggest number of prisoners regardless of their political affiliations
2461574 the issue of prisoners held in israeli jails is a political issue which is no less important than other permanent status issues it can only be resolved by setting up a timetable for the release of all the prisoners
2461575 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2461576 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2461577 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2461578 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2461579 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured

2461582 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2461583 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2461584 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2461585 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2461586 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2461587 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2461588 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2461589 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2461590 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2461591 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2461592 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2461593 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2461594 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2461595 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2461596 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2461597 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2461598 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2461599 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2461600 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2461601 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2461602 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2461603 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2461604 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2461605 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2461606 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2461607 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2461608 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2461609 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2461610 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2461611 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2461612 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2461613 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2461614 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2461615 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2461616 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2461617 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2461618 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2461619 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2461620 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project
2461621 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2461622 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2461623 gee thats a taste that im not familiar with but i somewhat enjoy it
2461624 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2461625 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2461626 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2461627 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2461628 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2461629 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2461630 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2461631 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do a fake consensus pushes climate change chicago tribune all 3 news articles
2461632 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2461633 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2461634 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2461635 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2461636 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2461637 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2461638 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2461639 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2461640 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2461641 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2461642 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2461643 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2461644 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2461645 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2461646 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
2461647 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2461648 let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation
2461649 michael moore is a supporter of yours and has endorsed you but in his new book mikes election guide he says the following go ahead and fill in the blank ive provided a full list of outrageously offensive lines already taken out of context in advance to make it easy for rightwing commentators and fox news will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
2461650 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2461651 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2461652 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2461653 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2461654 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2461655 just so you all know we did set a record
2461656 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2461657 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2461658 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2461659 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2461660 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2461661 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2461662 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2461663 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2461664 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2461665 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2461666 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2461667 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2461668 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2461669 estoy muy contento de regresar a espa a con el ub la palma
2461670 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2461671 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2461672 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2461673 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2461674 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2461675 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2461676 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2461677 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2461678 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2461679 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2461680 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2461681 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2461682 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2461683 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2461684 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2461685 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2461686 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2461687 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2461688 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2461689 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2461690 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2461691 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2461692 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
2461693 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2461694 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2461695 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2461696 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2461697 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2461698 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2461699 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2461700 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2461701 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2461702 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2461703 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2461704 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2461705 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2461706 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2461707 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2461708 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2461709 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2461710 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2461711 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2461712 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2461713 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2461714 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2461715 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2461716 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2461717 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2461718 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
2461719 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation

2461730 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2461731 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2461732 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2461733 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2461734 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2461735 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2461736 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2461737 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2461738 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2461739 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2461740 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2461741 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2461742 snow cover over north america and much of is greater than at any time since 1966
2461743 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2461744 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2461745 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2461746 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2461747 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2461748 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2461749 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2461750 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2461751 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2461752 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported

2461771 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2461772 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2461773 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2461774 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation

2461783 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice

2461785 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2461786 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2461787 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2461788 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2461789 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2461790 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2461791 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2461792 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2461793 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2461794 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2461795 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2461796 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2461797 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2461798 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2461799 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2461800 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels

2461804 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2461805 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2461806 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2461807 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2461808 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
2461809 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
2461810 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist

2461812 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2461813 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2461814 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2461815 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2461816 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

2461820 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2461821 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2461822 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2461823 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2461824 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2461825 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2461826 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2461827 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2461828 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2461829 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast

2461831 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2461832 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2461833 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2461834 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2461835 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2461836 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2461837 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2461838 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2461839 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2461840 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2461841 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2461842 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2461843 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2461844 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2461845 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2461846 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2461847 with all the hype around us qpr and signings from clubs of real madrids stature its the most anticipated season for us for a long while
2461848 this division is renowned for being tough and this year is no different in fact i would go as far to say harder than last looking at the teams involved
2461849 good luck to one and all apart from barnsley just for today
2461850 my opinion is that leicester will begin with a win against mk dons im going to it later and i just hope that we get off to a good start dickov to come on and score at least one to secure a win
2461851 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2461852 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2461853 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2461854 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2461855 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2461856 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2461857 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2461858 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2461859 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2461860 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2461861 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2461862 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2461863 theres no consensus about where the eu is going and who is coming with it
2461864 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2461865 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2461866 while safety is of paramount importance when the machines are stationary we want our guests to be able to mingle with the competitors

2461871 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2461872 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2461873 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2461876 the question in ireland was whether the democratic voice of a land of 4 2 million could dictate events affecting the lives of 500 million europeans the question in africa was whether an undemocratic coterie around mugabe could defy its neighbors its people and its own continent with complete impunity
2461877 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2461878 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2461879 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2461880 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2461881 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2461882 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2461883 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2461884 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2461885 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2461886 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2461887 this is not a trivial issue theres the basic unfairness of not covering these essential even life saving drugs and devices so fundamental to womens health and well being and the added insult of denying coverage while men are lavished with cut rate erections

2461895 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2461896 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2461897 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

2461902 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2461903 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2461904 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2461905 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2461906 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2461907 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2461908 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2461909 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2461910 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny

2461931 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2461932 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2461933 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2461934 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2461935 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2461936 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2461937 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush

2461964 16 years after my first olympics in barcelona i think a silver is pretty special
2461965 of course silver is one thing and gold is another but i gave it everything and it was a good finish for me but had a bit of cramps and wasnt at 100 in the sprint ive got mixed emotions because ive got lots of second places but this is perhaps the best of them all silver is just one step from the gold medal so its still very special
2461966 kolobnev went for a long sprint and i was on his wheel it was a normal sprint but sanchez was the strongest when he attacked it hurt and he was the strongest in the sprint so deserved to win
2461967 i have to thank my italian team mates they all worked well the early break was very dangerous but nibali did well to bring it back and then the other riders all played their part
2461968 im happy for davide but im not happy about my own race
2461969 im sorry he didnt get the gold but as we said the olympics is the only race where any medal is as good as a win

2461985 chef de mission k murugan was in two minds whether to leave them out or allow them in casuals they had just returned from practice and wanted to go personally their practice was more important for me than attending the ceremony im happy they still wanted to go murugan was bit confused and he finally allowed them to attend the ceremony in casuals
2461986 we had kept saree for all women athletes and it just happened that they didnt have time to change the chef de mission thought asking sania and sunitha not to go could lead to a controversy so he allowed
2461987 we wanted to make it colourful and hence they wore sarees of different colours
2461988 i did not want them knackered when they compete for thats the reason they are here thats why i told them to focus on their events

2462014 in the new silicon based led research the purdue engineers metallized the silicon substrate with a built in reflective layer of zirconium nitride when the led emits light some of it goes down and some goes up and we want the light that latoya figueroa goes down to bounce back up so we dont lose it said sands ordinarily zirconium nitride is unstable in the presence of silicon meaning it undergoes a chemical reaction that changes its properties the purdue researchers solved this problem by placing led anchor light an insulating layer of aluminum nitride between the silicon substrate and the zirconium nitride one of the main achievements in this work was placing a barrier on the silicon substrate to keep the zirconium nitride from reacting sands said

2462020 the unit growth doesnt seem to be slowing down either and is even higher than that of the first quarter the positive side is that the pc market has been sound however oversupply may be inevitable in the third quarter due to oems aggressive inventory build up during the second quarter
2462021 the market share battle between hynix and elpida could delay the market recovery

2462030 i think what has been underestimated is the backlash against the labor government the people of alice springs know what theyre talking about
2462031 i think that that passion hasnt been carried through i can understand that but it did need to have a lot of attention paid on alice springs

2462036 groups who spent a significant amount of time in karaokes from young age have a significantly better chance to get perfect high pitch than groups who did not enjoy karaoke as a main pass time
2462037 thats not quite right but its close enough so that must be what the research guy meant
2462038 one of the things that has been holding me back was needing to feel like everything was in place more or less before i took the time to exercise i felt like i had to have time to exercise nope ive got to make time i know but now i know what that really means it means making time to do it regardless of the chaos around me i am now starting to visualize a messy house not too hard a stack of piles waiting for me and me exercising anyway and then tacking all that stuff after ive exercised
2462039 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
2462040 it would be very savage of us to go break out of there and then come back and leave them hanging
2462041 its going to be a different environment and a different territory plus a different culture
2462042 the muslims from bosnia are different from the muslims in iraq
2462043 i think im going to have better backup with this than i had in bosnia
2462044 its going to be hard to change environment from the streets of greenwood to the streets of iraq
2462045 she was real valuable to the department because we have a lot of mexicans in the area we called on her to translate for us at all times and she did a great job with that

2462047 cardio doesnt boost your metabolism after exercise only strength training and interval training do that while you work sleep and eat your body will be shedding fat
2462048 not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action
2462049 it broadly defines everyone who works at a healthcare establishment as being involved in doing procedures
2462050 it allows everybody whether you are a receptionist or a maintenance person to object to doing their jobs because they object to abortion or sterilization
2462051 it puts women in the position of not knowing when they go to get healthcare if someone is going to say i am not going to help you here
2462052 these laws mandate the availability of ec emergency contraception in emergency rooms bar pharmacies from flatly refusing to fill prescriptions and mandate coverage of contraception when other prescriptions are covered
2462053 given that at least 17 5 million women in america are in need of publicly funded contraceptive services we believe the department should be working to increase access to these crucial health care services rather than working to limit them
2462054 i was fifth at the olympics in athens four years ago so im confident i can have a top five in beijing

2462070 edwards although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2462071 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2462072 nothings been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow ive participated in the payment of money that is a lie absolute lie
2462073 i was at the beverly hilton i was there for a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake from becoming public
2462074 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2462075 can i just say everything youre saying there are reports there are allegations these are all things from supermarket tabloids to make the most outrageous allegations every week anybody who walks by and looks at them knows that thats true you know a huge percentage is completely false
2462076 nothings been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow ive participated in the payment of money that is a lie absolute lie woodruff but youve edwards its typical in these types of publications
2462077 edwards no not true not true published in a supermarket tabloid but no that is absolutely not true
2462078 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2462079 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2462080 we received the birth certificate today and forwarded it to supreme court lawyer indira jaisingh seeking her advice on the future course of action
2462081 i too have heard about the birth certificate but i cannot confirm it
2462082 i would like to see a baseball team with the quality we had this year be in lodi for a long time
2462083 i would like to see someone involved on the business side be a person of integrity and have no one be misled or lied to i dont want stevie owning the team his track record precedes him
2462084 the last couple of months working with him were very difficult
2462085 i wanted to see the season end so he could sell the team and get out of town and quit the havoc hes putting people through
2462086 the bottom line is we had poor leadership and leadership starts at the top i was absolutely caught off guard about how much money we needed in the days leading up to the season
2462087 it wasnt my impression that rick thought he would get his investment right back
2462088 if i put in 35 000 and got 9 000 back already i would be feeling good
2462089 we all benefit from that all the users of the park i have no complaints
2462090 his desires seemed genuine and he had a great idea in creating a league and brining a team to lodi
2462091 but you cant go out and hurt the world with your great idea
2462092 things stevie said he was going to do i would go forward with and then he would change his mind a lot of bobbing weaving and misdirection
2462093 i easily spent 10 000 to 15 000 that im not seeking to be reimbursed
2462094 i was young and stupid sometimes youre in a situation where you lose money and you become afraid
2462095 i was running with the wrong crowd that was a bunch of gunslingers that drank and gambled too much now i have three young children and im excited about the future it was 10 years ago and it never came up until a month ago when it was used as leverage against me
2462096 this is a start up business trying to grind it out and make it
2462097 we havent used any of that money to run the team
2462098 everyone on our club was glad for the experience a lot of tears were shed when we left
2462099 in most headlines but those words not found in edwards statement rielle hunter
2462100 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006
2462101 one question which immediately comes to mind what was edwards doing leaving the beverly hilton at 2 40 in the morning visiting a woman he says he did not love and her baby which he says he did not father
2462102 edwards although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2462103 my actions in 2006 so careful in fact that he repeated the claim both in his statement and in his tv interview edwards
2462104 my actions in 2006 a hypnotic device to lull a once sonambulant big media back to sleep
2462105 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2462106 a m and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby
2462107 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family
2462108 his wife had not known about the beverly hilton meeting
2462109 not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2462110 we have decided that until all oustees get residential and agricultural areas of their choice they will not vacate their villages
2462111 for quenching the thirst of delhiites the government is hell bent upon taking away our livelihood
2462112 we would prefer a watery grave to surrendering to the government our land that has been tilled by our forefathers
2462113 every affected family must get at least 10 bighas of agriculture land at the new settlement and the compensation should be decided by taking us into confidence
2462114 such homes must also have intelligent kitchens where the food cooked should also protect the ecology we have to start the process of conservation with what we put in our mouths so it was important for a member of the teri family to get a product like this on print
2462115 we have gone overboard in using pesticides and we have to start promoting organic food in a big way to neutralise its effect
2462116 i tried to make the book reader friendly with cross references i have tried to describe each herb and the processes involved to pack it with maximum information even for the lay cook it was easy to edit because the book had real substance the recipes were good and well sorted and hence the process of polishing it to a finesse was easy unlike many other cook books
2462117 only 14 000 tonnes of the two million tonnes of food grown annually is organic
2462118 i want to dispel the notion that organic food is only vegetarian
2462119 you have organic chicken which grows naturally and all kinds of marine food are organic you cant put pesticides or medicines in sea water
2462120 tactical groups have completely liberated tskhinvali capital of south ossetia from the georgian military
2462121 the designers have delivered a fantastic overall look and i am confident that team gb will make an impact
2462122 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2462123 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2462124 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2462125 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2462126 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2462127 to find out full details and are ready to provide whatever assistance we can

2462132 in some ways its just another way to blog but in other ways its a really nice way to bring the community together
2462133 sometimes i think i will have a dozen people listening to a show but when i check the records it will be twice that amount
2462134 kind of hit or miss whether we get to broadcast those
2462135 theres a fine line between being a free public service for announcements and making it a revenue stream
2462136 i almost wept as i saw the medal which was to be ours slip away
2462137 it feels just great to think that im here to compete in my fifth olympic games its incredible surely winning a medal would make it even more memorable for me
2462138 im peaking at the right time as well i did not have a great start to the season but things gradually started falling in place and last five weeks have been really satisfying something obvious from my rankings
2462139 at this level you have to take every match seriously you just cannot afford to lower the guard every day would be tough battle
2462140 the defeat in athens still hurts it rankles me to think that we lost the match when we were just two match points away from the medal i want to right the wrong here
2462141 today keith he began staring ahead into a kind of middle distance i saw one of the greatest things i have ever had the opportunity to experience and try to understand
2462142 i know all about new zealand you have a north island and a south island and you have maoris do you have any maoris in your team id like to see one i am very interested in maoris
2462143 nope he firmly replied i dont hire clubs when i play mine are custom made

2462152 andy and i go out to win every tournament we play in
2462153 but in the olympics the main thing is to come home with a medal whatever the colour yet after losing so narrowly to the bryans who will be the top seeds in china we feel we are good enough for gold
2462154 we havent had such a good week for two or three months and we felt we really played well
2462155 i think were back on track and that gives us a lot of confidence for the olympics and the us open
2462156 i hope that jonathan will only miss a few tournaments
2462157 perhaps ill play with harel levy instead but i hope jonathan will see things differently and come back soon
2462158 they should do it win medals even if there are problems among the quartet
2462159 by that i mean the two tennis players and their wives
2462160 we maintained secrecy to enable everyone the rabbis too to express themselves freely
2462161 my husband has been waiting for two years to have this case settled in court and the stress has destroyed his life
2462162 he is living a nightmare existence he is being denied his human rights to live with his wife and he is now suffering a breakdown
2462163 he is going to be dead by next week if nothing is done
2462164 thats why im going if the case is not heard then i will tie myself to the railings outside
2462165 i am doing this because i am desperate i would not do it if things werent critical
2462166 we lost our businesses because he was not here to work and i was spending so much of my time on trying to get his case heard and on going to israel so often to see him
2462167 we had a stainless steel manufacturing business with 100 000 worth of contacts i am a behavioural psychologist and i ran a consultancy business with an annual turnover of 1 million
2462168 i live in a rented two bedroom flat and am on income support our whole life has been turned upside down
2462169 i have seen a judge only twice in the past two years i just want to get a judgment and a settlement so this can all be finished
2462170 i have almost killed myself because of this it is destroying my life and mariannes
2462171 i am living minute by minute and my whole life revolves around getting this sorted out
2462172 the proceedings in the case are taking place in the family court and are therefore taking place behind closed doors
2462173 both sides have notified the court that they are negotiating a financial agreement to resolve all the differences between them and that on august 10 they will notify the court if they have succeeded
2462174 tzipi is saying to people that she has the best chance of winning a general elections
2462175 which appeals to those afraid to lose their knesset seats and mofaz is saying that he has the better to chance to form a government without going for elections which makes some mks think he might appoint them as ministers
2462176 we will prove that kadima is a real grassroots party and that tzipi appeals to the rank and file members
2462177 but by getting more endorsements we will reassure more members
2462178 many mks are trying to deflect the pressure by saying that they dont want to announce who they are supporting before the ninth of av
2462179 but i believe that most of them will eventually go for tzipi
2462180 it was an insult for her a founder of kadima unlike mofaz who stayed at first in the likud to make such a commitment
2462181 and besides how can she commit to staying in the party if it might adopt far right positions in the future
2462182 it maddens me that i am not taking part in the olympics
2462183 everyone ranked in the top 100 will be there except for me
2462184 in the past some players ranked in the bottom 100 have even taken gold medals but for israel being ranked in the top 100 is not enough
2462185 not since the days of amos mansdorf has israel been in the top tier of the davis cup and i carried us there
2462186 after such an achievement they still dont appreciate me enough to send me to the olympics this has sapped my motivation to play in the next davis cup
2462187 hes an excellent tennis player who represented israel outstandingly in the davis cup and can without a doubt represent israel with honour in the olympics
2462188 but winning a medal is easier said than done the olympics are fundamentally different from the davis cup
2462189 we threw him a lifeline at wimbledon and he didnt take it he lost in the first rounds in a number of tournaments and the only person whose actions determine whether he is going to beijing or not is sela himself he didnt even come close to making the cut
2462190 we cant allow ourselves to get caught in the crossfire we have to be able to decide quickly what to do with them according to israeli interests and not take orders from the palestinians
2462191 of course we try and get information from the palestinian patients
2462192 what intelligence agency wouldnt try but its not a condition for receiving treatment there could have been misunderstandings and that is another reason for improving the whole process
2462193 a relatively affluent group of people with middle class values and middle class lifestyles
2462194 continued upward mobility of jews and their entry into the highest employment echelons of the british work environment

2462196 the palestinians are bringing their women and children to the demonstrations to use as human shields
2462197 he was a boy how could they shoot him in the head
2462198 he was my right hand he would work and make money to support his sisters who will give them money now
2462199 anyone who is in an area of demonstrations is there on his own responsibility
2462200 two months ago they fired at the legs today its at the head

2462202 i am not saying fire at the head but he should do everything to neutralise the assailant

2462206 i made a mistake im sorry how do i fix this
2462207 life is really very simple what we give out we get back
2462208 what you choose not to look at rules your life
2462209 if it werent for the fact that the tv set and the refrigerator are so far apart some of us wouldnt get any exercise at all
2462210 experience is what you get when you didnt get what you wanted
2462211 youve got a lot of choices if getting out of bed in the morning is a chore and youre not smiling on a regular basis try another choice
2462212 do you realize if it werent for edison wed be watching tv by candlelight
2462213 today give a stranger one of your smiles it might be the only sunshine he sees all day
2462214 dont be fooled by the calendar there are only as many days in the year as you make use of
2462215 as a child day dreaming of what your future would hold for you what did you want to be when you grew up did you ever pursue or achieve it if you could be trained and placed in any career beginning tomorrow what would it be
2462216 dreams are answers to questions we havent yet figures out how to ask
2462217 the real problem with leisure time is how to keep others from using yours
2462218 oui mais je le sentais ce coup ca compte au poker
2462219 one must change ones tactics every ten years if one wishes to maintain ones superiority
2462220 i think its fair to say well be improving the campaign map
2462221 its easy to design a complicated system hard to design an easy system that retains flavour
2462222 the thing is gusts dont actually move at the speed of the wind
2462223 getting 10 000 guys to collide with each other and objects and find their way out of a paper bag now thats a problem
2462224 one is a shift in technology to drive the arms race the second is lots of different factions all vying for some prize where in reality any of them could have won but only one of them did
2462225 in this period the key use of cavalry was not to plough into the infantry but to scare and harass the infantry into remaining in a square formation
2462226 a square of men beats a cavalry charge a column of men will beat a long line but only if it arrives and a line of men pointing the maximum amount of muskets to an advancing force will always beat a square
2462227 columns of french infantry marched up towards the british line stationed on a ridge the british maintained their line and managed to chase them off the french then charged with cavalry they got a bit impetuous and just all went so the british formed squares but because the french didnt have any infantry supporting the cavalry the english could see them off again they repeated that cycle a number of times they couldnt get infantry and cavalry to the english lines at the same time
2462228 we will have a fire button its a sort of override tool so you can time your shot when you want to and timing is critical let off muskets too early and you wont do enough damage let off your muskets too late in the face of a cavalry charge and youve got every chance of being crushed by a flying dead horse
2462229 cover becomes really important in the battle of blenheim for instance a lot of the fighting was focused around capturing and occupying key buildings that creates focal points for the battle adding drama its almost like terrain plus can i capture this farmhouse its a strong point that you can try and hold a dramatic node for the battle to focus around
2462230 cannonballs go through people they bounce and they bounce differently depending on the surface they hit they leave huge stripes of dead bodies as the unit routs
2462231 but weve always wanted to do them properly thats why we havent tackled them in previous games its a big chunk if youre going to do it you have to do it really really really well
2462232 ive been staggered by how good it looks for quite some time now and were not done yet theres one guy i gave a job to i said make sea look like the sea its a hard challenge sea is incredibly complicated stuff we want to model different wind conditions different light conditions different weather conditions the thing is that gusts of wind dont actually move at the speed of the wind a gust of wind is caused by a whirlpool of wind moving vertically they actually move quite slowly and cover quite large areas you see it because it makes the surface of the water rough and the rest shiny it means you can build gameplay into entering and chasing gusts of wind and using them to overtake an enemy fleet
2462233 weve got a full and very detailed damage model on these ships the cannonballs can damage the hull theyll damage the panels they go through theyll kill individual men they also knock down masts tear sails off that obviously affects the manoeuvrability of your ships you can tell your ships whether you want to aim at the sails or at the hull or at the men on the decks you can choose what ammunition to load or even whether to board an enemy ship
2462234 you want to cross in front or behind its called crossing the enemys t thats the classic line of battle you want to line ships up so your gunnery faces the enemy essentially the ships are just great big floating double deckers full of guns you want those rows facing the enemy there are other tactics doubling where you effectively get your line of ships around the front of the enemy and bring them around the enemys line so youre firing from both sides
2462235 thats important because boats only have enough gun crew to fire from one side at once youre getting a two to one advantage
2462236 thats a tactic we can get in the game it works similarly raking fire what nelson did at trafalgar was precisely the opposite he charged in and fired along the longitudinal axis of the ships from stern to bow from back to front naval translation ed instead of the cannonball going through one gun crew and out the other side potentially it could plough all the way along the decks and take out nearly all the gun crews in a single shot
2462237 at the same time that we start the second game we start work on the completely new engine from the coders point of view that gives you a nice clean codebase to work from if you evolve an engine over more than two iterations plus the add ons it starts to creak it turns to spaghetti if you start from scratch everything takes a great leap forward usually in speed but in technique as well
2462238 one of the quirks of the old engine was that the diplomacy and military ai were two separate routines developed separately by two different programmers those systems fought each other the military side would say we need to invade while the diplomatic side will say well i just made a treaty with them getting them to work together was difficult it meant the behaviour wasnt always consistent
2462239 its fair to say that the campaign map in rome and medieval was divided into army sized tiles
2462240 each tile could hold one army in empire theres no tiling system the player will never see any type of tiling artefact its entirely freeform its like taking the squares off the chessboard
2462241 our instinct is to purely tell it how it was i actually dont think anyone will be too upset about us portraying colonisation in the game it happened and unless you delete vast quantities of history you cant get rid of it it was a force for good and ill and exactly what the balance of that is its up to historians to work out
2462242 yes i think the best bet is to include it but not to have it as a gameplay feature
2462243 some people will be quite offended by that that were not allowing them to trade slaves but its not necessary to make the game work youre not going to be landing in africa and dragging slaves off to america

2462264 you know we have listened carefully to what you have had to say to us we deeply regret that our actions cause you distress even a diminishment of your ability to evangelize in your context but we must minister in and to our own context as best we can discern gods will for us we will no longer observe or pretend to observe the moratoria on consecrations and blessings we will abide by our own canons which in two different places bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and if and when a partnered gay or lesbian person is elected by the clergy and laity of a diocese we will consider them for consent as we would any other and we will proceed to ask the standing liturgical commission over the next triennium to develop authorized rites for the blessing of same sex unions to be brought back to the 2012 general convention this will necessarily involve our articulation of the theology of blessing which underlies this action which you have asked for we will no longer sacrifice the faithful gay and lesbian members of this church for the sake of a unity we seem unable to define

2462275 3 click on the quality of service qos tab you should see your bandwidth settings take a look at your sustained uplink data rate and sustained downlink data rate by default they should be both at 256 see those are your default download and upload limits kinda sucks right 4 alright so listen well change both of the uplink and downlink values to 500 actually you can set the values to any number you like as long as their total would be 1000 eg you can have your downlink 600 and uplink 400 or you can have downlink 700 and uplink 300 however the recommended value for both uplink and downlink rates is both at 500 so i suggest you have the recommended value as well click the save changes button

2462324 neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
2462325 god has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father

2462337 i would love to come into a church that was unified where everyone loved each other and they all prayed for the pastor
2462338 and he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry to the building up of the body of christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god
2462339 christ from whom the whole body being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual part causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love
2462340 therefore laying aside falsehood speak truth each one of you with his neighbor for we are members of one another be angry and yet do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not give the devil an opportunity he who steals must steal no longer let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth do not grieve the holy spirit of god by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice be kind to one another tender hearted forgiving each other just as god in christ also has forgiven you
2462341 with all prayer and petition pray at all times in the spirit and with this in view be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints and pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains that in proclaiming it i may speak boldly as i ought to speak
2462342 simplify this its too complicated im not sure what youre saying
2462343 pray that ill be able to preach the word boldly with effectiveness
2462344 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another even as i have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
2462345 if you love me keep my commandments he who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me and he who loves me will be loved my my father he who does not love me does not keep my words
2462346 just as the father loved me i have also loved you abide in my love
2462347 this is my commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends
2462348 truly truly i say to you that if you ask the father for anything in my name he will give it to you ask and you will receive so that your joy may be made full
2462349 i do not ask on behalf of these alone but for those also who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as you father are in me and i in you that they also may be in us so that the world may believe that you sent me
2462350 that they may be perfected in unity so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you have loved me
2462351 i have made your name known to them and will make it known so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and i in them
2462352 and the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul
2462353 unity in the church is so important that the new testament gives more attention to it than to either heaven or hell god deeply desires that we experience oneness and harmony with each other unity is the soul of fellowship destroy it and you rip the heart out of christs body
2462354 nothing on earth is more valuable to god than his church
2462355 make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace

2462367 mandela believed that embracing his rivals was a way of controlling them they were more dangerous on their own than within his circle of influence
2462368 there are a thousand things nelson mandela was bitter about but he knew he had to project the exact opposite emotion
2462369 to look for simple explanations is the bias of the human brain but it doesnt correspond to reality nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears
2462370 knowing how to abandon a failed idea task or relationship is often the most difficult kind of decision a leader has to make

2462375 were fully expecting that the first network dvr systems will have every parameter set to be like the rs dvr
2462376 if theres discrete storage required for every customer thats going to be quite a lot of disk you need
2462377 i think what will happen is people will realize that you dont have to force everyone to have different copies of the same program
2462378 it doesnt hurt the content owners any more to have shared storage in a network dvr than everybody having their recordings in their set tops
2462379 but they figured out how to make it work the cable industry is very good at resolving these issues
2462380 now it doesnt make a difference where i set up my recording and where i view my recording

2462429 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2462430 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2462431 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2462432 komisch ist nur dass man bei der bundeswehr f r krampfadern ausgemustert wird und beim zivildienst scheinbar nicht
2462433 o spun de fiecare data mediasul joaca orice meci la victorie ne asteapta un meci greu un meci foarte greu nu ne multumeste un punct un rezultat egal vrem sa scapam de acest 1 in dreptul punctajului va fi un meci foarte greu timisoara a facut egal la pitesti apoi a zdrobit pandurii au pretentii mari au investit mult si nu va fi usor sa speram ca dupa acest meci vom fi si noi bucurosi si ca jocul nostru bun se va repeta de data asta mai eficient si cu rezultat in clasament jucatorii sunt pregatiti pentru prima victorie din campionat ne am dat seama ca rigorile ligii i sunt la nivelul organizatoric dar la nivelul gazonului echipa noastra e bine pregatita si poate face fata oricarei echipe speram sa ne impunem jocul nostru ofensiv si sa facem ca rezultatul sa fie in favoarea noastra
2462434 vrem sa intarim victoria cu pandurii cu un triumf in jocul de sambata ne asteapta un meci cu o nou promovata care nu a reusit sa puncteze mult in primele doua etape insa a jucat foarte bine in startul de campionat gaz metan a evoluat bine in aceste prime doua etape a executat excelent fazele fixe ma astept sa fie un meci de calitate nu vreau sa spun acum prea multe despre ei insa au mijlocasi laterali buni

2462449 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2462450 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2462451 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2462452 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2462453 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2462454 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2462455 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2462456 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2462457 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2462458 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2462459 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2462460 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2462461 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2462462 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2462463 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2462464 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2462465 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2462466 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2462467 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2462468 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2462469 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2462470 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2462481 once again this kakadu series has demonstrated how well the royal australian navy ran and her international colleagues continue to work together in all aspects of common maritime warfare and security
2462482 the maritime warfare exercises conducted between the ran and visiting navies have provided vital experiences for all involved the opportunity to work together to improve combined maritime warfare procedures and tactics has been invaluable
2462483 i thank the people of darwin and the northern territory for their support during kakadu ix it is a beautiful part of the world to exercise in

2462488 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2462489 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2462490 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2462491 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2462492 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2462493 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened the fire at their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2462494 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legal document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2462495 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a requirement because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2462496 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2462497 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2462498 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2462499 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2462500 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2462501 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2462502 today im going to sign a decree to introduce martial law in georgia and present it to parliament for approval
2462503 there is no bombing of tskhinvali street battles are continuing in the city involving our soldiers we do not plan to bomb our own servicemen in tskhinvali
2462504 most of south ossetias territory has been liberated and is now controlled by georgia i call on russia to stop bombarding peaceful georgian towns
2462505 is heading a meeting to discuss a series of urgent measures to stop the violence in south ossetia to protect the civilian population and russian citizens in the conflict zone
2462506 the goal of georgias actions in the conflict zone is to establish peace in the region and we will not stop until we have attained this goal
2462507 georgia has tried to build a fortified structure a block post near the nuli village our reaction to such actions will be very tough because we see them as bandits who open fire on our civilians
2462508 russia is putting in a great deal of effort to promote the idea of peace talks we treat such initiatives with understanding and believe they are necessary
2462509 we insist on the talks including russia and north ossetia we will not hold one to one discussions with georgia
2462510 is acting as a constructive and responsible mediator the aim of which is to diminish the tensions to restart the negotiating process aimed at settling of the conflict
2462511 we have an influx of volunteers coming into the republic so far we see no necessity for them but those who are arriving are being organised into army units these units will be under the command of our defence ministry
2462512 they voiced concern about the actions of the georgian side near tskhinvali which can be regarded as preparations for war

2462542 for god bonnie queen vickie and the opium trade charge
2462543 gentlemen i have some good news and i have some bad news the good news is that profits are up 73 2 on a volume of trade which has increased 27 over the same three month period last year and that all of our operations appear to be running smoothly indigenous peoples of india burma china and several other areas with a propensity to cause problems are now happily stoned out of their minds on our products and are causing no further trouble
2462544 the bad news is that were all probably going to spend the next 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 years roasting on a barbecue pit for this shit

2462570 as the victim of nuclear bombs our country has a duty and responsibility for taking the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons
2462571 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2462572 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2462573 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2462574 it was a deadly weapon that has also afflicted survivors for the rest of their lives
2462575 we actually started our series work to anticipate this change here in 2002 weve been investing to get ready for this real fundamental shift for quite a while the os will have to change to deal with the heterogeneous many core world where you are today is just a transition point from single core machines to ill say at a steady state point where youre going to have a lot of processors on a chip but they wont all look the same
2462576 the many core world today is one where its still a homogeneous symmetric multiprocessor architecture frankly the operating system vista does a great job on those multiprocessor machines and in fact its the same technology that runs the 128 processor data center servers the problem is the applications in the data center we know how to take workloads and smear them out across those things and you get good efficiency but all the worlds programmers were given a set of tools and a set of techniques for the last 30 or 40 years where when they wrote an application they squashed out all the parallelism that was intrinsic in it and its that serial manifestation that limits our ability to use those additional cores
2462577 and so today its the applications that havent gotten there not so much the operating system both will evolve the fundamental breakthrough thats required is to make it easy enough for people to do complex parallel applications that can use a lot of cpu in a client device
2462578 the two or four core cpus found in todays machines will give way to processor chips with dozens of cores on them some of which may not even share instruction sets let alone implementations at the same time hypervisors currently used for server consolidation will become a standard element of the client desktop giving us the ability to partition the physical hardware among multiple virtual machines some specialized for particular tasks executing in parallel
2462579 massive parallelism will lead to experiences you could once only dream of to enable these next generation experiences we must develop simpler ways of expressing parallelism in code and provide tools to make developers successful at doing so
2462580 our teams mission is to enable the masses of developers to readily exploit parallelism and our roadmap begins with the next version of visual studio
2462581 the parallel computing team will find success by applying research and incubation results to innovate 360 degrees in the software stack libraries languages runtime systems and code generation and are actively working on both native and managed technologies managed technologies include plinq parallel version of linq task parallel library formerly known as c futures a concurrency runtime with fine grained work scheduling algorithms concurrent data structures deeper library support for parallelism transactional memory etc and closely collaborate with other teams in microsoft like msr windows and clr native technologies include building a new user mode cooperative scheduler with fine grained work scheduling resource manager to support multiple schedulers a new asynchronous messaging model and parallel patterns libraries example parallel for
2462582 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2462583 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2462584 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2462585 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2462586 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2462587 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2462589 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2462590 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2462619 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising

2462622 seria muito bom para o jud se terminasse isso ter amos um jud mais bonito com mais golpes sem um monte de gente se jogando
2462623 na hora da luta voc tem que conseguir fazer o que planejou nem sempre d certo

2462628 el emparejamiento de dobles es de lo peor que te puede tocar no hemos tenido suerte porque el equipo sueco es muy fuerte pero hay que jugarlo y vamos a intentar sacar el partido adelante
2462629 es un rival duro con mucha experiencia y que se encuentra en un buen momento
2462630 quiero ayudar al equipo en lo que pueda no tengo explosividad sin explosividad poco se puede hacer y yo a n menos ha habido momentos en los que no hemos sido nosotras pero en otros s hemos remontado dos veces el marcador y hemos estado muy cerca aunque es cierto que han estado todo el rato por delante y que se han merecido ganar
2462631 dominaron el juego y el rebote todo el partido luego hubo una diferencia abismal en el rebote tiraron m s del doble de tiros libres y as es muy dif cil ganar
2462632 estos partidos sirven para tratar de lograr una plantilla lo m s homog nea posible a estas alturas no buscamos resultados ni funcionamiento sino una preparaci n acorde a toda la plantilla y no a un equipo
2462633 se est trabajando de forma muy intensa y no se ha bajado la carga de intensidad en todos los amistosos que hemos disputado la pretemporada se est realizando en base a lo previsto y por suerte ha habido muy pocas lesiones
2462634 llorente ibagaza y edmilson son tres refuerzos importantes que seguramente van a cumplir un rol de apoyo y se han integrado r pidamente al funcionamiento del equipo
2462635 ten amos que haber hecho la tarea un poco antes pero hay que hace una lectura positiva sin llegar a ser como acostumbra espa a ha estado puntito de ganar a nada que pulamos determinados detalles que nos creamos que estamos dentro de los juegos y que tenemos que salir a por todas desde el minuto uno el equipo competir en cada partido
2462636 no es tan f cil dar las claves de la derrota pero viendo el dibujo del partido quiz haya sido la irregularidad el equipo ha hecho todo el rato la goma como se dice en ciclismo eso es un sobreesfuerzo tremendo y cuando llegas a un final igualado est s a expensas de acertar o fallar el tiro clave

2462640 i dont know if i can live long enough to see the next olympics so i had to be here to participate to show i care
2462641 look at the spirit of these people isnt it exciting
2462642 i was leading the second game and maybe took a few too many risks i did not keep pushing into the four corners in the third game
2462643 i think its going to take something extremely fast to win
2462644 i cant say exactly but i think its going to have to be definitely much faster than the worlds
2462645 ive run five 200m this season including the four rounds at the u s olympic team trials
2462646 it is less than i have ran before but i also didnt run many in 2004 before the games
2462647 we have four girls and we hope to get one in the top six and one medal
2462648 it doesnt really matter to me at this point i just want to go and compete well i want to do my country proud and lift like i know i can lift
2462649 ive been told they have 100 000 women weightlifters in china thats more than the rest of the world
2462650 for all that we think weve learned the lessons of the 1960s we are still letting our historic buildings go
2462651 we have to fully understand the need to save and preserve our local heritage if buildings are allowed to go to rack and ruin like this one theyre going to be knocked down too many buildings in the west midlands have been neglected
2462652 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2462653 im no rush im just very proud of my result today
2462654 i think what has been underestimated is the backlash against the labor government the people of alice springs know what theyre talking about
2462655 i think that that passion hasnt been carried through i can understand that but it did need to have a lot of attention paid on alice springs
2462656 yey got my mocha frap 4 free 2day thnx bud

2462660 fallon started to find his form but hes been hit by a sucker punch
2462661 i think weve got about eight good medal chances in the british swimming team and if you convert 50 youre doing well so if britain go away with four medals theyll be happy
2462662 it was a very difficult first race i got a lead then unfortunately the wind shut off it wasnt really what i envisaged luckily i turned things round in the second race all in all it could have been worse
2462663 im the only spectator at the archery its a relaxed vibe but not fiery enough at the mo time to get down to the water cube
2462664 re 1028 never expected sanchez to win that schleck didnt have enough left rogers was spent and cancellara didnt quite have enough to get through was expecting rebellin to win but sanchez looks delighted schlecks furious at missing out on the medals
2462665 times arent the be and and end all we didnt have our game a race but what we did was good enough for today
2462666 hi cheese are there any brits left in the mens road race cheers
2462667 we knew it was a really tough heat we havent raced for seven weeks thats a good wake up call if we want to get into that final were going to have to fight like hell
2462668 oi cheese has valverde dropped out of the mens road race
2462669 re 0935 100 doesnt mean one hundred it means 1 waza ari 0 yukos and 0 kokas more correctly it should read 1 0 0
2462670 re 0902 come on craig were behind you all the way
2462671 re 0839 alan campbell was awesome the knee seemed to have no effect at all
2462672 on way to the archery bring on the magic arrows
2462673 the knees all right i got into a nice race got one under the belt two months ago i was in hospital waking up with a very sore knee so im more than pleased with that
2462674 re 0732 the batons they bang together are called thundersticks they love them at the tour de france
2462675 dont worry about ben ainslie traditionally he always has a bad first day at the olympics he might have taken a penalty were trying to find out by the way the british yngling boat recovered brilliantly to finish second overall at one point they were last
2462676 so far in the dressage stage of the three day eventing both british riders to have gone have left the arena disappointed william fox pitt is 11th daisy dick 13th with the british team sixth overall and miles away from gold according to fox pitt
2462677 craig fallon faces an anxious wait to see if he can fight for a bronze in the judo his fate now lies with the austrian who won their second round match if the austrian reaches the semis then fallon can fight on in the repechage if not its all over
2462678 ive got the team off to a good start and they should be buzzing now we were all a bit down after what happened to frankie gavin
2462679 re 0740 that point against fallon was the worst decision i have seen in any sport ever equivalent in football to the ball crossing the halfway line and a goal being awarded
2462680 at the boxing listened to wedding presents take me on the way so pumped up i may jump in the ring
2462681 just watched the chinese number one win the weightlifting tell you what i would have no worries letting her carry the shopping bags from the car i would probably even get an extra crate of lager
2462682 israel get on decently with the vault next up is great britain daniel keatings does a very powerful vault scores 15 625
2462683 cmon craig fallon gold in the judo today i reckon enjoying the beach volleyball be great in 2012 when the kitschest of olympic sports is held in horseguards parade
2462684 i think its going to be a day for the tour de france riders
2462685 here in oz and hearing about their brilliant swimmers non stop i marked their card about our cyclists and boxers in particular one frankie gavin
2462686 it wasnt what i expected and it is a little disappointing he parkmore ed was bit lit up and i had to keep him under control yesterdays disruption didnt help and i think the authorities made more of an issue of it than necessary
2462687 its only early here in hong kong and we can already feel the humidity rising and its going to be very stamina sapping over the next few days the absence of zara phillips has certainly weakened the interest in the eventing schedule but it shouldnt weaken britains medal hopes
2462688 so is this teams event or individual or both does this relate to overall eventing where they do the jumping and cross country etc thanks
2462689 i was warned about the heat and humidity but they didnt tell me i was going to nearly drown
2462690 i dont really understand this dressage thing at all but what the hell its the olympics woo low scores good
2462691 spring along was very naughty at the badminton horse trials this year and showing two fingers to the judges is his attitude but daisy did a good job there and the british team will be happy with that
2462692 cant believe how hot it looks out there what time is it in china
2462693 im here until 6am cant wait love these kind of early sports can you tell us which of the brits are competing

2462697 as the victim of nuclear bombs our country has a duty and responsibility for taking the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons
2462698 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2462699 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2462700 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt

2462753 creating a new agency at this time would require substantial structural legislative and organizational reform which would inevitably take some time to deliver
2462754 we took the view that the most effective way to ensure the implementation of the report is to use the structures and agencies that are already in place to build up their capacity and to ensure that there is collaboration between them where that is appropriate
2462755 these existing agencies should drive the organizational and cultural reform that would be necessary to achieve substantive change in the future
2462756 the united states olympic committee has learned of an incident that occurred earlier today involving two family members of a coach for the united states olympic mens indoor volleyball team
2462757 two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2462758 the filipino athletes here represent all filipinos know that the whole country is cheering for you
2462759 we are proud of our athletes who qualified to compete in the olympics there are only 15 because it is very hard to qualify the fact that theyve qualified means that they are already champions
2462760 the filipinos like sports and know the sacrifices that our athletes make manny pacquiao is an idol of many because we see his sacrifices and the fruits of these sacrifices in his triumphs in the world stage
2462761 die hauptverantwortlichen waren die wachmannschaften soldaten des flugplatzes volkssturm auch b rger aus unserer region und es gab eben auch kapos die sich in der letzten stunde aus einer hoffnungslosen situation heraus haben missbrauchen lassen

2462766 crassly conceived unaccountable unaudited crossrail hole pack campaign told you so
2462767 this is a serious problem while the vast majority of care staff want to do a good job there are a tiny minority who would do older people harm and there must be safeguards in place to assure that they do not slip through the net
2462768 we believe that given the work many of them are undertaking brings them into intimate contact with patients there is an overwhelming case for regulation on the grounds of patient safety
2462769 the mirror is to be congratulated on highlighting this important issue
2462770 older people have a right to be treated with dignity and respect and receive care from properly trained staff our current review of care and support is considering how we can meet the challenges of an ageing society
2462771 once youve got your certificate from us you can get a job in a hospital nursing home or with social services in peoples homes nursing assistants are in high demand and id be surprised if you havent got a job after two or three weeks the skys the limit
2462772 there is no difference between you and a qualified nurse you can now walk the walk and talk the talk people will be looking to you as their saviour
2462773 the arrangement we have with browncross is that they do not send anyone here who is not crb or pova checked and the impression i had is that everybody had been vetted
2462774 from now on we will refuse to have anybody here to be trained from them before we accept anybody here to work they have to be crb checked and everybody here has an nvq qualification in social care
2462775 we are performing wonders in peoples lives we are doing a lot of good for society and the community unfortunately we are a private and independent organisation we could do much more if we were recognised by the government as for the level of education of trainees this is why we are giving them training considering that people could go straight to employment without doing any training i think we are doing a good job
2462776 we are actually helping to reduce criminality because we are working in tower hamlets which is one of the poorest areas of the country helping people here find employment
2462777 we would welcome a system that makes healthcare workers more accountable anything that safeguards the health and safety of the most vulnerable can only be a good thing
2462778 non accredited courses will not be recognised by reputable employers so certificates given to students may not be worth the paper they are written on
2462779 high quality patient care depends on staff being properly trained we would urge anyone to think carefully before undertaking any non accredited training as they may well be wasting their money
2462780 we would very much support the regulation of healthcare support workers who have contact with vulnerable people
2462781 since 2004 the department of health has commissioned several reports reviews and white papers looking at regulation
2462782 there is currently a pilot project in the nhs in scotland which runs until december and the government is awaiting the outcome of that before taking it further

2462787 your neighbors probably find you odd dont you think they regard jean paul sartre and pablo picasso as odd dont you would you want your daughters to marry anyone like them
2462788 if a novel is based on plot the characters will rigorously refuse to come to life

2462790 just your regular run of the mill polygamist boo hoo tragedy
2462791 i know its hard to believe people really talk like that
2462792 but consider this if you didnt know anything else if your only source of information was the prophet youd probably believe it too you wouldnt know how to form a doubt
2462793 i have heard an esteemed medical doctor say that illness is the loneliest state i would argue that doubt deserves that claim
2462794 why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
2462795 myself included seem to take driving a car fairly lightly perhaps holding on to some simple myths of independence and power but it is actually an incredibly complex and demanding task
2462796 why youre not as good a driver as you think you are
2462797 for those of us who are not brain surgeons driving is probably the most complex everyday thing we do it is a skill that consists of at least fifteen hundred subskills at any moment we are navigating through terrain scanning our environment for hazards and information maintaining our position on the road judging speed making decisions about twenty per mile one study found evaluating risk adjusting instruments anticipating the future actions of others even as we may be sipping a latte thinking about last nights episode of american idol quieting a toddler or checking voice mail a survey of one stretch of road in maryland found that a piece of information was presented every two feet which at 30 miles per hour the study reasoned meant the driver was exposed to 1 320 items of information or roughly 440 words per minute this is akin to reading three paragraphs like this one while also looking at lots of pretty pictures not to mention doing all the other things mentioned above and then repeating the cycle every minute you drive
2462798 a simple mantra you can carry about with you in traffic
2462799 when a situation feels dangerous to you its probably more safe than you know when a situation feels safe that is precisely when you should feel on guard most crashes after all happen on dry roads on clear sunny days to sober drivers
2462800 a climbing twisting broken asphalt nightmare of blind hairpin turns
2462801 there was little to keep me from tumbling off the edge of the road
2462802 a smooth flat road with gentle curves and plenty of visibility
2462803 i just about fell asleep and ran off the road
2462804 the things that work best in the traffic world of the highway consistency uniformity wide lanes knowing what to expect ahead of time the reduction of conflicts the restriction of access and the removal of obstacles have little or no place in the social world
2462805 anonymity in traffic acts as a powerful drug with several curious side effects on the one hand because we feel that no one is watching or that no one we know will see us the inside of the car itself becomes a useful place for self expression the flip side of anonymity is that it encourages aggression
2462806 as the inner life of the driver begins to come into focus it is becoming clear not only that distraction is the single biggest problem on the road but that we have little concept of just how distracted we are
2462807 drive as if the world is a television show viewed on tivo that can be paused in real time one can duck out for a moment grab a beer from the fridge and come back to right where they left off without missing a beat
2462808 as a profession traffic engineering has historically tended to treat pedestrians like little bits of irritating sand gumming up the works of their smoothly humming traffic machines with a touch of condescending pity pedestrians are referred to as vulnerable road users as a testament to the inherent bias of the profession no engineer has ever written a paper about how vehicular interference disrupts the saturation flow rates of people trying to cross the street
2462809 how traffic explains the world on driving with a local accent
2462810 traffic is a sort of secret window onto the inner heart of a place a form of cultural expression as vital as language dress or music its the reason a horn in rome does not mean the same thing as a horn in stockholm why flashing your headlights at another driver is understood one way on the german autobahn and quite another way on the 405 in los angeles why people jaywalk constantly in new york and hardly at all in copenhagen these are the impressions that stick with us greek drivers are crazy the visitor to athens will observe safely back in kabul
2462811 more people were killed in the united states on saturday and sunday from midnight to three a m than all those who were killed from midnight to three a m the rest of the week
2462812 statistically the most dangerous day to be on the road
2462813 nearly twenty times more beer is drunk in total on super bowl sunday than on an average day
2462814 car drivers have less to fear from big trucks than from what they themselves do around big trucks
2462815 are high heavy and have very stiff front ends meaning other vehicles have to absorb more energy in a crash

2462820 your typical yuppie food nazi living inside a cocoon of self entitlement
2462821 we only need two books the bible and the gulag
2462822 peremptory nature of his judgments the absence of nuance and his lack of tolerance for the opinions of others
2462823 a new deal for west virginia a pictorial history of arthurdale eleanor roosevelt and the origins of community planning
2462824 i feel alive when i think of daphne du maurier i feel that her life contains all kinds of clues and messages that might help me make sense of mine
2462825 i must say theres nothing like being lectured on henry james by ones husband to put you off both of them
2462826 what right do i have to try to make connections between du mauriers books and her life its dangerous territory like all those dated sentimental bront biographies spinning the myth about saintly charlotte and spiritual emily and bad branwell and gentle anne those kinds of books make me feel uncomfortable its the literary equivalent of catching butterflies and then killing them in order to pin them down and display them in a box
2462827 its only finished when you sell it or you die
2462828 the book read as such tracts often do as plausible although a bit paranoid until president george w bush announced that the united states could deploy armed force where and when it wanted without asking anyones permission and did so in iraq in 2003
2462829 today there is a good chance that empire might eclipse republic
2462830 to make this case he argues that the modern united states with its far flung military bases and far reaching corporate behemoths has created a new kind of empire
2462831 de gedachte dat het beeld van de fulltime werkende en succesvolle moeder meer geaccepteerd wordt is overduidelijk een mythe
2462832 sterker nog het idee dat er moeders met een hoge functie zijn die vervolgens na het werk thuis koekjes bakken en de kindjes verhaaltjes voorlezen is juist aan slijtage onderhevig
2462833 steeds meer mensen mannen en vrouwen geloven dat het onhaalbaar is
2462834 we as the women in the rural areas we are still depending on our husbands because we are not working
2462835 most of the women are abused by their husbands and continue to stay with them because they know they cannot survive without them
2462836 we can say we are free now as women but there are some challenges that we are facing such as in the working environment
2462837 we as women need to prove to ourselves that we can get top positions because we deserve it not because of the affirmative action
2462838 women need to go out there and see what they can do life was better in the older days now things have changed and the abuse is very high
2462839 i need to emphasise that these programmes war on poverty will as they rightly should be founded on women based turnaround strategies since women bear the brunt of poverty
2462840 women are the major participants in the second economy that covers sectors like trade catering accommodation and most importantly poverty in many households has a feminine face
2462841 that is why i refer to women as frontline combatants in the war on poverty since we believe that it is simply unacceptable for young teenage mothers to rely on girl children for support
2462842 we have gathered here today during womens month to say with one voice that we all embrace the theme of business unusual all power to women
2462843 we embrace gender and womens rights because as nelson mandela said at our countrys opening on 24 may 1994 freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression
2462844 we still have to confront persisting incidents of gender discrimination in public and at workplaces and face up to women and child abuse at home
2462845 we concede that our people have to deal with present challenges of soaring foodstuffs high fuel costs and worsening poverty
2462846 all of us are too aware of the continuing challenge of school dropouts among our youth teenage pregnancy and unemployment among able bodied youth which contributes to the poverty cycle
2462847 if we going to conquer poverty and unemployment women have to be at the forefront as commanders in chief in their families
2462848 if women stand steadfast in this battle to winning the war on poverty we would have secured the future for our children and thus defeating inter generational poverty among poor households
2462849 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behaviour as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2462850 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2462851 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella
2462852 la casa se reserva el derecho de admision y permanencia
2462853 those who argue that the united states would inevitably become the target of unhappy iraqis generally also assume that the iraqi population would be hostile to u s forces from the outset
2462854 however the best evidence we have suggests that the iraqi people would be pleased to be liberated
2462855 that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars
2462856 the fiasco of regime change in iraq should make washington very reticent about trying to overthrow another middle eastern autocracy
2462857 consequently the regimes will remain and they will remain the most powerful forces in their societies for many years to come
2462858 giulietta has put villalongas corpse in one of our suitcases we are in a large hotel theyre giving us a different room im afraid that the young bellhop lingering next to the big suitcase with the dead body might suspect something

2462863 was not a dream come true all i ever wanted is what you have right now a baby a husband who really loved me a home all the happiness that they could bring i never got that and thats all i really wanted

2462865 we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time
2462866 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2462867 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2462870 about eighty five thousand patients a year more than double the number who were admitted to the hospital were treated at the clinics the hospital made an effort to install doctors and staff who spoke the same language and when possible were from the same background as the patients
2462871 i lie all the time i am a crazy woman
2462872 is her uncanny ability to read lace people come from all over the world to be read by eva and she can tell your past present and future pretty accurately just by holding the lace in front of you and squinting her eyes
2462873 they came to get you because you were a woman alone in the world
2462874 or because you were different because your hair was red or because you had no children of your own and no husband to protect you or maybe even because you owned property that one of them wanted
2462875 no two readers will ever see the same images in the lace
2462876 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2462877 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2462878 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2462879 one afternoon when tan and i were playing hide and seek we found a boy bundled in a blanket beneath a pile of hay at the back corner of the barn shriveled and bloated with starvation he looked like some sort of bug all head and belly big eyed and heaving ribs almost hairless semi conscious and possibly mute he was past talking it appeared he had crawled into the stable to die

2462881 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2462882 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2462883 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2462897 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2462898 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2462899 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2462900 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2462901 they could not land there had always been the distance america reached out for thousands of miles and its sense of touch stopped three miles short

2462907 punk didnt just change what i listened to and how i dressed
2462908 the score is kept teetering by the use throughout of the destabilizing tritone
2462909 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2462910 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2462911 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2462912 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2462915 to prove the truth of his claim that he had painted the vermeers that all europe had admired van meegeren painted one more while in police custody
2462916 you think i sold a vermeer to that fat goering but its not a vermeer i painted it myself
2462917 the time was world war ii the place occupied holland
2462918 the sums that changed hands soared into the millions the artist who inspired that frenzy of buying was one of the best loved painters who ever lived johannes vermeer the collectors vying for masterpieces included both adolf hitler and hermann goering
2462919 admiration of vermeer took on a new dimension that had little to do with his marquee value art historians and ordinary art lovers alike saw embodied in the great painter the very qualities that goering and his ilk had put most at risk
2462920 in all the world there are only three dozen vermeers
2462921 even a conqueror with europe at his feet could do nothing to alter that brute fact
2462922 yesterday this picture was worth millions of guilders and experts and art lovers would come from all over the world and pay money to see it

2462928 the stain is ours because whatever else the iraq war was about it was always above all about america about the projection of americas force and americas image into the world iraq was the stage and iraqis would suffer for that enduring some fifty deaths for every american life lost in this and by every other measure of devastation it was very much their war

2462935 a course not only for our international response but also in our domestic constitutional relations
2462936 was a discussion of policy not just what was legal but what was moral ethical right and smart to do
2462937 fundamentally the drive for expanded presidential authority was about power
2462938 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2462939 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2462940 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2462941 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2462942 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2462943 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2462944 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2462945 who are open to doing something on the production side
2462946 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2462947 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2462948 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2462949 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2462950 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2462951 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2462952 the powerful build of an olympic child gymnast the narrow hips the shield chest
2462953 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2462954 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2462955 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2462956 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2462957 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2462958 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2462959 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2462960 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2462961 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2462962 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2462963 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2462964 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2462965 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2462966 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2462967 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2462968 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2462969 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2462970 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2462971 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2462972 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2462973 german troops readied to march across the czechoslovak border in may of 1938
2462974 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2462983 their enigmatic alliance would eventually form the core of the havana mob
2462984 the huge gulf between these two diametrically opposed forces could not be reconciled
2462985 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2462986 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2462987 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2462988 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2462989 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2462990 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2462991 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2462992 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2462993 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2462994 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2462995 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2462996 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2462997 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2462998 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2462999 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2463000 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2463001 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2463002 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2463003 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2463004 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2463005 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2463006 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2463007 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2463008 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2463009 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2463010 the country had every manifestation of the post 1865 union save negro senators and decent peanut butter

2463012 carrying the historical burden that only she has the strength to bear
2463013 the united states stand at this moment at the summit of the world
2463014 i rejoice that this should be so let them act up to the level of their power and their responsibility not for themselves but for others for all men in all lands and then a brighter day may dawn upon human history
2463015 the story of the first century of the united states is more or less the passage from the first to the second

2463017 that had successfully fought for its independence from spain and had eliminated slavery to boot while the united states seemed to be invading for the express purpose of restoring it
2463018 the critics did not believe even after reading the novel that a wealthy black society actually existed in the secret uptown shadows of their own this was the liberal era in our politics and the negro was understood by all to be poor oppressed and in special need of white solicitude

2463022 many u s soviet diplomatic encounters had no tangible outcome at all other than a deeper appreciation of patterns of thinking and the development of lines of communication which sometimes turned out to be useful when a crisis suddenly broke
2463023 may end in bad temper but until it is tried it is hard to know the key point is to reduce the symbolic significance of the fact of the conversation and present it as no more than normal diplomacy
2463024 history never repeats but attitudes and arguments dilemmas and excuses clich s and delusions recur with the inevitability of a sun setting on successive empires
2463025 though new imperialism was justified as an agent of modernization the british perpetuated existing hierarchies resistant to fundamental change moreover since sultans and emirs owed their offices to foreigners and infidels they forfeited their legitimacy too often becoming demoralized or dissolute
2463026 we were innocent kids with new toys and a license to steal
2463027 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2463028 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2463029 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2463030 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2463031 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2463032 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2463036 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2463037 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2463044 wir haben die gewerbesteuer von 350 auf 300 punkte gesenkt
2463045 wir hatten ein riesiges schild aufgespannt auf dem dietenhofen china 1 0 stand
2463046 in einem jahr war die raumstation der renner so dass wir mit der produktion nicht mehr hinterher gekommen sind

2463049 the carpet just swelled up from underneath and the water just started flowing it all happened in only a few seconds
2463050 it must have been a couple of inches across a large area of the shop we have been here for 17 years and this has never happened before but it was a pretty heavy storm
2463051 one might have feared a tidal wave of applications but that has not happened obviously people are targeting the post they want they are spreading their applications so that across the country people are getting applications in the thousands though not tens of thousands therefore so far so good
2463052 professor elisabeth paice of the london deanery argued that creating an organisation dedicated specifically to medical education would make it more difficult to integrate planning and would isolate decisions about the medical workforce from their wider context i would hate to see medical isolationism as the outcome of this and a step backwards from the integration of service strategy and financial planning using medical education if you like as an enabler for service change and reform
2463053 obviously those people turned up elsewhere and are doing extremely well it is good for patients that good people are all over the country but it is very sad for individual doctors who perhaps have set their heart on particular placements one of the outcomes is that people have applied for jobs and have got them but feel very distressed at the outcome
2463054 with the european working time directive and so many changes in the health service the way we deliver training has to change and we have to change the way in which we assess people so be more reliable and robust a lot of this change is being driven rightly by pmetb and the standards set by it
2463055 i think we have been speaking absolutely with one voice through what has been an extremely difficult time it is correct that the experience has been different if one asked whether this had been smooth one would get two answers yes and no but that is not the same as not being together in what we are trying to achieve
2463056 we believe it is because of the heavy rain people are not driving to the conditions
2463057 walt is at the heart of our very close family and we cant bear to think of him not being a part of it
2463058 he had been enjoying his evening out with his two daughters laura and becky the night started at the pub he jointly owns the chequers in headington quarry and they then went on to the regal
2463059 everybody who knows walt thinks the world of him and he would do anything for anyone he is a normal and very down to earth family man with plenty to look forward to
2463060 this is a very heartbreaking time for us and we feel destroyed by what has happened
2463061 all of us are desperate to have walt back home with us and to spend time together as a family again

2463067 i think particularly at the olympic level at the top level the pressure comes as much from expectation of what people think you can do as it does from your competitors
2463068 michael is able to basically ignore all of those things which is super hard to do
2463069 i think thats just a very familiar pattern that he does and it gets his mind in a place where it needs to be
2463070 i remember clearly the first time he swam at nationals he swam very very well in the prelims and came back that night and i was very curious to see how he would do the first time in the finals and he just walked out and did his normal routine
2463071 thats very rare that you would have some kid who is 14 up on the blocks stretching and doing all this stuff while the other guys are sitting back in their chairs most kids would succumb to peer pressure and do what the other guys were doing but he just totally did his own thing
2463072 i think its about time that someone else take the responsibility and im happy to pass the baton on to someone that im sure i have inspired
2463073 thirty six years is a long time to be honest if he doesnt do it then it was not meant to be but it does not take away from his greatness hes shown a different kind of courage than i did i was not chasing seven gold medals
2463074 i hope he does it but the odds are against him
2463075 thats not a knock on him but there are always going to be upsets my guess is there is going to be an upset in beijing

2463081 there is no one more fitting to perform the final set than jack whose stature among the great bass guitarists of all time is unquestioned and who admired greatly
2463082 we are pleased that the fda has designated multaq for priority review
2463083 this follows the exciting results of the landmark athena study that showed multaq significantly decreased the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations or death from any cause in patients with atrial fibrillation
2463084 i think the focus of those involved in illegal immigration during that time was to ensure there was a change in the demography of sabahs population
2463085 it is not in my dna how can i love him if i even cannt say the words

2463089 in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didnt commit these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune if you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire the a team

2463095 wahai tuhanku adakah engkau menciptakan makhluk yang lebih baik daripada aku
2463096 wahai jibril kamu telah menyembah aku dengan ibadah yang bersungguh sungguh dan tidak ada seorang pun yang menyembah kepadaku seperti ibadat kamu akan tetapi di akhir zaman nanti akan datang seorang nabi yang mulia yang paling aku cintai namanya muhammad dia mempunyai umat yang lemah dan sentiasa berdosa sekiranya mereka itu mengerjakan solat dua rakaat yang hanya sebentar sahaja dan mereka dalam keadaan lupa serta serba kurang fikiran mereka melayang bermacam macam dan dosa mereka pun besar juga maka demi kemuliaannku dan ketinggianku sesungguhnya solat mereka itu aku lebih sukai dari solatmu itu karena mereka mengerjakan solat atas perintahku sedangkan kamu mengerjakan solat bukan atas perintahku
2463097 ya tuhanku apakah yang engkau hadiahkan kepada mereka sebagai imbalan ibadat mereka
2463098 ya jibril akan aku berikan syurga mawaa sebagai tempat tinggal
2463099 ya tuhanku apakah sudah aku menempuh jarak perjalanan setengahnya atau sepertiganya atau seperempatnya
2463100 wahai jibril kalau kamu dapat terbang selama 3000 tahun dan meskipun aku memberikan kekuatan kepadamu seperti kekuatan yang engkau miliki lalu kamu terbang seperti yang telah kamu lakukan niscaya kamu tidak akan sampai kepada sepersepuluh dari beberapa perpuluhan yang telah kuberikan kepada umat muhammad terhadap imbalan solat dua rakaat yang mereka kerjakan

2463189 greg mckendry was someone deeply concerned with helping people in a financial crisis
2463190 adkisson killed the man most likely to help him and able to have an effect on him he shattered and traumatized a church that helps people in many different ways if hed have come to the door looking for help wed have figured a way to help him
2463191 the church he attacked was probably the most sensitive to his plight he was going after the ones who in reality would love him the most
2463192 we opened up the congregation and over 1 000 were there
2463193 they were standing in the aisles standing outside i thought it was going to be private grief for the congregation but we had muslims jews buddhists other christian denominations the outpouring of community support we felt a love that carried us and doesnt discriminate from race religion or sexual orientation
2463194 were very much at the beginning of the grieving process
2463195 were still dealing with greg mckendrys loss weve still got members in the hospital weve got a lot of trauma a lot of people still have a picture of the shooting in their heads weve been fortunate the red cross and the unitarian trauma team came down and have the skills to deal with this theyve been doing counseling and processing for people of all ages
2463196 adkisson committed an act of terror but he inspired quick and decisive acts of courage he came here with hate but he inspired acts of overpowering love he came to divide us and created a process of community love no matter who you are
2463197 moments of depression moments of hope its a continuing journey what speaks the loudest is that over 800 people showed up for the church rededication the following sunday and renewed our faith
2463198 one of his colleagues told him god puts the right minister in the right place at the right time and we would agree with this were glad to have him here

2463229 as soon as you mention mental illness they try to deny it right away whether they recognize they have some of the symptoms or not
2463230 this is very sad but this is the reality theyre a forgotten group until someone acts dangerous or violent in public making it worse
2463231 with support and treatment these people can function and go back in the community
2463232 i think the public is very backward when it comes to mental health education
2463233 how is it that a g8 country one of the most wealthy and well educated has such a huge section of the population with a nearly medieval understanding of mental health and mental illness
2463234 lets say li had been born in 2080 he goes to school and learns how his brain and emotions work talking about mental illness is as easy as talking about obesity and diabetes
2463235 his family talks about it his church talks about it then in adolescence li develops schizophrenia his youth pastor and his family say we need to go to a doctor he gets all the help he needs and never comes down with full blown psychosis
2463236 there are very very few services available in the city and province for people coming from other countries
2463237 certainly a lot of people with churches and other religion affiliated organizations have been working with immigrants
2463238 but there arent really any organized or professional counselling services available to that population
2463239 a lot of our cultures are based on paternalism which makes it even more difficult for men to disclose mental illness
2463240 the no 1 health issue among immigrants is mental health and depression

2463247 even though reading the appeal record we find evidence to confirm that the appellants anwar dan sukma were involved in homosexual activities and we are more inclined to believe that the alleged incident at tivoli villa did happen sometime this court as a court of law may only convict the appellants if the prosecution has successfully proved that the alleged offences as stated in the charge beyond reasonable doubt
2463248 i am aware of efforts to find if i had committed offences during my 22 years as prime minister so far they havent found anything but now they have found an indirect way of getting at me i am not seeking sympathy from anyone but it is a little bit too much to expect me to forget and forgive something that is happening now as a result of anwars plottings now he has turned his attention to dato seri najib as usual he has found someone to make incriminating statements for him there seems to be no connection between his plotting against me and his attack against dato seri najib but if we look into who would be the beneficiary we would see the connection like ian chin helping the present powers that be is a form of defence
2463249 accettare la rappresentazione come un qualcosa che innanzi tutto irriducibile significherebbe polverizzare lessere e il mondo dicono a una sola voce idealisti realisti e scettici per concludere che la rappresentazione non o si lascia ridurre ad altro oppure che un mondo comune non esiste o non se ne pu dir nulla

2463262 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes
2463263 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it

2463275 on january 31 1971 members of vietnam veterans against the war vvaw met in a detroit hotel to discuss war crimes they claimed to have participated in or witnessed during their combat tours in vietnam during the next three days more than 100 vietnam veterans and 16 civilians gave anguished emotional testimony describing hundreds of atrocities against innocent civilians in south vietnam including rape arson torture murder and the shelling or napalming of entire villages the witnesses stated that these acts were being committed casually and routinely under orders as a matter of policy
2463276 in april 1971 the vvaw stormed washington in a week long protest at its height spokesman john kerry went before the senate committee on foreign relations to accuse the united states military of committing massive numbers of war crimes in vietnam the appearance launched kerrys political career the charges he made shocked and sickened a nation changed the course of a war and stained the reputation of the american military for decades
2463277 but the mass murder of civilians was never american policy in vietnam

2463298 en lo que va corrido de este a o han matado casi tantos sindicalistas como en todo el 2007 la tendencia a la baja que se registraba desde el 2002 en los asesinatos se quebr desde enero pasado el negativo resultado empa a la celebraci n del d a internacional del trabajo los sindicatos aseguran que los muertos son 24 mientras que el gobierno dice que 22 en todo caso la cifra es cercana a la de 2007 cuando fueron asesinados 26 si se compara marzo del a o pasado con el mismo mes del 2008 los homicidios se han incrementado en 300 por ciento
2463299 los argumentos del gobierno y sus defensores a menudo son contraproducentes intentar demostrar por ejemplo que los sindicalistas tienen una tasa de homicidios menor que la media nacional es eludir el problema
2463300 se le ocurre que esos problemas pobreza extrema en ee uu etc se resuelven cambiando el orden social para implantar el socialismo

2463304 i believe that most christians who get to heaven will be seriously disappointed
2463305 always remember the ones who were not able to inherit
2463306 these passages are all talking about christians and yet none of them inherited the kingdom yes they were all in it but they were in some other region some other place the darkness outside and thus separated from the light of the lords presence
2463307 my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering
2463308 lord i do not deserve to have you come under my roof but just say the word and my servant will be healed for i myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me i tell this one go and he goes and that one come and he comes i say to my servant do this and he does it
2463309 i tell you the truth i have not found anyone in israel with such great faith i say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2463310 therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit
2463311 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son he sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come but they refused to come
2463312 then he sent some more servants and said tell those who have been invited that i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet
2463313 but they paid no attention and went off one to his field another to his business the rest seized his servants mistreated them and killed them the king was enraged he sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city
2463314 then he said to his servants the wedding banquet is ready but those i invited did not deserve to come
2463315 but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes friend he asked how did you get in here without wedding clothes the man was speechless
2463316 then the king told the attendants tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2463317 behold i come like a thief blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed

2463323 one set of factors that i examined did consis tently raise the likelihood that people from a given country will participate in terrorism namely the suppression of civil liberties and political rights including freedom of the press the freedom to assemble and democratic rights using data from the freedom house index for example i found that countries with low levels of civil liberties are more likely to be the countries of origin of the perpetra tors of terrorist attacks

2463342 cerca de 80 por ciento de los asesinatos de los sindicalistas no tuvieron que ver con la actividad sindical tal como lo reconocen las propias centrales obreras y el gobierno colombiano
2463343 the colombian unions own research center says killings dropped to 39 last year from a high of 275 in 1996
2463344 of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001 almost all for murder the ruling judges found that union activity was the motive in only 17 even if you add the 16 cases in which motive was not established the number doesnt reach half of the cases the judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization the unions dont dispute the numbers instead they say the prosecutors and the courts are wasting time and being anti union by seeking to establish motive a novel position in legal jurisprudence the two main guerrilla groups have an avowed strategy of infiltrating unions which attracts violence about a third of the identified murderers of union members are leftist guerrillas
2463345 la historia del sindicalismo colombiano tuvo momentos de gloria cuando logr grandes conquistas como la seguridad social la ley de tierras de 1936 y la racionalizaci n de la jornada laboral ese sin embargo es el pasado hoy nuestro sindicalismo muestra abundantes se ales de decadencia tan solo el 5 de los trabajadores del sector formal de la econom a pertenece a alg n grupo sindical la participaci n de los m s j venes es pr cticamente nula lo que queda del sindicalismo est concentrado en el sector p blico mientras que en el sector privado una larga tendencia de marchitamiento se aceler en los a os recientes hasta llevarlo al borde de la extinci n la actual reforma del estado seguramente llevar a un proceso similar de deterioro en los sindicatos p blicos
2463346 the unions report that they have 1 million members thirty nine killings in 2007 is a murder rate of 4 unionists per 100 000 there were 15 400 homicides in colombia last year not counting combat deaths according to the national police that is a murder rate of 34citizens per 100 000

2463352 el hombre del congreso americano cree que hay una estrecha correlacion entre los derechos de los trabajadores y la tasa de asesinatos de sindicalistas y esto es incorrecto
2463353 the democrats also say they oppose the agreement because of the assassination of unionists in colombia it is a powerful argument except for this while the murder of even one union organizer is deplorable the numbers being used are so misleading that they should not be cited in opposing the agreement all sides agree that the killings are dramatically down and no one accuses the government of orchestrating them by the unions own count the killings dropped from a high of 275 in 1996 to 39 last year the government says 26 the assumption by the democrats is that all were killed for union organizing it is an assumption implied in reports they cite from groups such as human rights watch and amnesty international those groups however rely on colombian unions for their numbers instead of collecting their own the number of convictions now being won in the unions own cases reveals that perhaps one fifth and almost certainly less than half of the killings had to do with unionism of convictions won in 87 cases since the first one in 2001 almost all for murder the ruling judges found that union activity was the motive in only 17 according to the attorney generals office the judges found 15 of the cases had to do with common crime 10 with passion and 13 with being guerrilla members no motive was established in 16 of the cases the unions dont dispute the judicial findings and deep in their reports say that they in fact have no idea of suspect or motive in 79 percent of their cases going back to 1986 the killings in other words are isolated and not part of a campaign against unionizing the unions further benefit from the reduced paramilitary and guerrilla violence the convictions have cut impunity the government provides protection from free mobile phones to bodyguards for nearly 2 000 union leaders
2463354 on march 9 carlos burbano vice president of the national hospital workers union in colombia was murdered in san vicente del cagu n after leading a local peace march his corpse was found in the city dump his face disfigured with acid he was one of four colombian trade unionists killed in a single week their deaths were not random crimes in a dangerous country rather the colombian government has falsely denounced union activists as guerrilla sympathizers opening the door for paramilitary groups death threats

2463413 childress delfino and all these other offers start coming up and all of a sudden you start hearing the talk circulating from teams over there and what theyre willing to do
2463414 as athletes you have to listen to that thats the least you can do
2463415 i think its going to take something extremely fast to win
2463416 i cant say exactly but i think its going to have to be definitely much faster than the worlds
2463417 ive run five 200m this season including the four rounds at the u s olympic team trials
2463418 it is less than i have ran before but i also didnt run many in 2004 before the games
2463419 a guy who i just think has done great is chris bosh every practice every game
2463420 in the ball screen defense hes so long and because he has perimeter skills hes somebody that we can rely on he can get more minutes
2463421 all prepared for anything starting is not an issue whatever we do with that whether it be at the start of a quarter game or half anybody may take that a certain way but theres no messages being sent
2463422 his length and his athletic ability and his basketball iq is great
2463423 he helps us defensively a lot and on the offensive end hes very good at setting screens and getting to an open area and getting layups and dunks he averages 10 points a game off just playing the game the right way
2463424 whether im starting coming off the second string or the third string im going to come in and do my job play solid defense work on getting our guards open and getting easy baskets and rebounding the basketball
2463425 last year i was still trying to find my role
2463426 i was still looking it was frustrating i didnt know where i could fit in where i could be effective and i think coach k was really trying to search for it too
2463427 i sat back and looked on the outside and was like you know what i know what i can do now and its really really helped me out
2463428 i was leading the second game and maybe took a few too many risks i did not keep pushing into the four corners in the third game
2463429 its not us i dont think its us i really dont
2463430 i said that from the beginning i said coming into this tournament i dont think were the favorites and i think were going to relish that role that underdog role
2463431 we want people to understand that this is going to be a tough task
2463432 i think some people do understand that its not going to be easy because if it was we would have won in 2004 we would have won in 2006
2463433 i think theres been so much media hype and media attention that were probably the favorites when it comes to the general population but they really dont matter
2463434 if you talk to spain argentina or greece or any of those teams theyre not intimidated by us one bit not at all so i mean those are the guys that really count
2463435 nothing thats surprising anymore to me i believe every team that we play and every individual that we play is good
2463436 theyre on their national team just like were on our national team so they have to be good were not looking at any team or downplaying any individual on any team at all
2463437 the olympics are another level up from other games obviously a very different environment because it only happens once every four years
2463438 the foreigners would likely get a grip of my hair
2463439 im just going to cut it because i want to win bad ive put too much work in to lose because of long hair ive got to get the gold
2463440 a russian just grabbed a grip of my hair and held onto it
2463441 she did take a good picture then i got a picture with her also
2463442 i kind of warned all my friends that it might be kind of a defamation of the chinese flag or something
2463443 i know the chinese government is strict and unyielding so i kind of told them to leave those at home keep them a secret
2463444 maybe ill make my own t shirt with a marker or something
2463445 the russian track and field federation has made the decision that this athlete will not start in beijing
2463446 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
2463447 the dna analysis are 100 percent so if the urine does not belong to the athlete then they certainly have a case to answer its a sad story
2463448 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
2463449 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
2463450 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
2463451 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
2463452 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
2463453 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers
2463454 i just want to clean the place up and make it look like a shopping center instead of a hitching post
2463455 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
2463456 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
2463457 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
2463458 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
2463459 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
2463460 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
2463461 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
2463462 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
2463463 we will have eight schools in each of nine regions across the united states
2463464 in about 20 years you will see a veritas national championship
2463465 we had a mantra today and it lit us on fire
2463466 we didnt hold back for one moment we competed like it was our last day
2463467 ive been dreaming of playing in the nfl all my life and now i get a chance
2463468 i know its only a preseason game but im looking forward to walking on that field as a buffalo bill for the first time
2463469 i have been waiting for this since i was drafted so i want to be out there with my teammates but it is the preseason the most important thing is being ready for sept 7 regular season opener
2463470 this game will be a big learning process for him
2463471 they always say that one of the biggest learning steps comes from the first and the second game this first game will be good for him to be able to get in there and see what the game is like get a feel for the game hopefully if he plays and then move forward from there
2463472 im just excited about playing and showing them what i can do
2463473 they drafted me pretty high so i want to show them that i was worth a no 1 pick
2463474 l a russia dovrebbe cessare le sue operazioni militari immediatamente e incondizionatamente e ritirare tutte le sue forze dal territorio sovrano della georgia
2463475 the people who get the produce are the ones who often eat poorly and cant get fresh produce
2463476 when this came up eight years ago we thought it was something we could try and build each year and have fun while helping others less fortunate
2463477 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work
2463478 when a person really desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream
2463479 partnership and co operation among nations is not a choice it is the only way the only way to
2463480 i knew thered be plenty of tie dye here but i thought if i wear a suit thatll send a different message
2463481 you know were going to donate glynns organs to five other people
2463482 just think when that young man wakes up with glynns heart what a great start he has in life what a great heart he has
2463483 if we remember those times and places and there are so many where people have behaved magnificently this gives us the energy to act and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction and if we do act in however small a way we dont have to wait for some grand utopian future the future is an infinite succession of presents and to live now as we think human beings should live in defiance of all that is bad around us is itself a marvelous victory
2463484 you think this is funny huh just wait until i come back down im going to kick your ass
2463485 if you make me fall im going home you are on your own stop it
2463486 though it may not be a smart thing to oppose the war but i did so because it was the right thing to do
2463487 though it may not be a smart thing to support obama i will do so because i feel today that it is the right thing to do
2463488 well its kinda true but i have tried dick since ive been on summer vacation in miami ive absolutely been on the dick train i am from northern florida and the studs up there are so blah but down here in miami the men are totally sexy this was the first time id ever really been sexually attracted to the male sex so i figured it was time to finally lose my virginity i can not believe i even waited this long
2463489 i think i like them about the same slit was my first love so no matter how many guys i fuck i will never lose my lezzie tendencies sometimes i just get a craving to smell and eat a moist vagina but i also really like it when a guy with a giant pecker sticks it deep in my cunt it feels better than when a girl fucks me with a vibrator nothing compares to the real thing
2463490 b u is a huge place so do you know where they are
2463491 well if you can get in youll find them everywhere
2463492 back there i saw them behind one one of the dormitories

2463524 my mother died and that was 20 years ago thats what matters to you she was alive one day and dead the next thats the worst thing thats ever happened to me this is not really up there with that you are in this game to win when the players and fans suffer disappointment you suffer along with them i still feel it as much as it did when it happened 15 or 20 years ago that never goes away from you if you are competitive then thats what happens to you managers always take the responsibility for it thats a managers job and what he does we will just get up and get on with it to make sure we dont let it cause us a problem starting on sunday at falkirk thats something we have to bear in mind more than anything else people can criticise managers players or whoever but now we have to make sure it doesnt create a more upsetting circumstance

2463535 im so sorry jordan ive got some terrible news grandma died
2463536 it all happened within just a few hours of jordan arriving at the house so it wasnt because he started to lose it and wanted off the show

2463645 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2463646 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2463647 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2463648 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2463649 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2463650 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2463651 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2463652 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2463718 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2463719 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2463720 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2463721 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2463722 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2463723 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2463724 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2463725 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2463726 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2463727 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2463728 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2463729 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2463730 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2463731 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2463732 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong

2463893 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2463894 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2463895 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you

2463994 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
2463995 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate

2464001 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
2464002 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain

2464006 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
2464007 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
2464008 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
2464009 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model

2464014 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
2464015 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
2464016 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars

2464033 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
2464034 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
2464035 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
2464036 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
2464037 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

2464055 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2464056 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2464057 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
2464058 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
2464059 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts

2464067 he just kept asking me why am i on the terrorist watch list
2464068 i wanted them to have a carefree childhood and now they have big questions about terrorism

2464072 was like yelling and screaming and acting really erratically and they didnt know what the situation was so they asked him just to calm down and so forth and he made a movement towards them so they had to tase him
2464073 after he was tased and handcuffed one officer used a football type kick and stomped him in the head
2464074 they killed that man they killed him they killed him she added her hands trembling the woman said she saw one officer stomp on mr thomass upper back holding his foot there while the subject lay on the sidewalk with his head hanging over the curb another officer reared back and punched him in the head with all his might she said

2464079 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
2464080 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
2464081 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
2464082 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
2464083 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
2464084 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families
2464085 the mission was to saturate the area so thoroughly with napalm that all installations on that area would be burned
2464086 but the flashes observed on the ground indicated the intensity of the fire to be accurate enough to destroy any about
2464087 methodical destruction of dwellings and other buildings forward of front lines which are or susceptible of being utilized by the enemy for shelter
2464088 methodical burning out poor farmers when no enemy is present is against the grain of u s soldiers
2464089 when the napalm hit the entrance the blast and smoke knocked out kerosene and castor oil lamps we had in the cave
2464090 it was a pitch black chaos people shouting for each other stampeding choking some said we should crawl in deeper covering our faces with wet cloth some said we should rush out through the blaze those who were not burned to death suffocated
2464091 the americans pushed us back toward the enemy area and then bombed us
2464092 if you say these killings were not deliberate and were mistakes how can you explain the fact that there were so many of these incidents

2464116 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2464117 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2464118 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2464119 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2464120 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2464121 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2464122 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2464123 its very disturbing that we do not understand the climate on a planet that is so much like the earth
2464124 it is telling us that we really dont understand the earth we have ended up with a lot of mysteries
2464125 thick atmosphere traps solar radiation and heats the world to boiling point
2464126 carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans where it forms carbonate minerals and over the millennia is deposited as rock
2464127 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2464128 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2464129 snow cover over north america and much of siberia mongolia and china is greater than at any time since 1966
2464130 that there is anthropological and geological evidence of much greater melts in the past
2464131 climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of manmade warming on polar ice melt
2464132 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2464133 its a really bad thing for a scientist to have an immovable intractable position
2464134 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2464135 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2464136 in the past 70 years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the last 11 400 years
2464137 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2464138 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2464139 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that kyoto could inflict on the worlds poor
2464140 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2464141 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2464142 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2464143 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
2464144 cloudiness varies according to how many atomic particles are coming in from exploded stars
2464145 free drifting icebergs hotspots of chemical and biological enrichment in the weddell sea
2464146 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

2464151 grandsyaikh abdullah faiz daghestani telah memberi otoritas dari rasulullah saw kepada saya untuk seluruh cabang thariqat naqsybandi di seluruh penjuru timur amp barat agar mereka datang dan memperbaharui ikrar mereka di hadapan kami oleh karenanya ikrar tersebut adalah sebuah deklarasi bagi semua pengikut naqsybandi yang jumlahnya mencapai ratusan bahkan jutaan orang merasa takut akan jumlahnya bayat di masjid istiqlal setelah mawlana syaikh hisham kabbani memberikan kutbah jumat tetapi mereka salah paham mengira bahwa kita mengejar dunya padahal tidaklah demikian kita hanya mengharapkan ridha allah swt semata mata karena satu satunya jalan yang benar bagi seorang hamba adalah mengharapkan ridha dari tuhannya kita tidak menggunakan kekuatan spiritual untuk kehidupan di dunia ini tetapi kita menggunakannya untuk mencapai maqam yang lebih tinggi di surga oleh sebab itu tidak ada rasa takut pada diri jutaan pengikut naqsybandi mereka orang orang harus merasa puas dengan para pengikut naqsybandi kita adalah muslim naqshbandi target kita hanyalah mencapai ridha allah swt tuhan pemilik surga tidak ada yang lain siapa yang senang terhadap kita mereka boleh datang dan selamat datang siapa yang tidak mereka boleh pergi sesuka hati mereka bayat di daarut tauhid bandung aa gym dan jamaah pesantren daarut tauhid setiap orang di seluruh penjuru di timur dan barat harus memperbarui thariqat mereka melalui grandsyaikh mereka dan beliau memberi izin kepada saya atas nama grandsyaikh saya memberi bayat kepada setiap orang yang mengikuti thariqat naqsybandi bila mereka menerima itu adalah untuk kebaikan mereka siapa yang menolak mereka boleh tinggal di mana pun mereka berada mulai sekarang sampai hari pembalasan nanti jusuf kalla dan arifin ilham berbayat di darmawangsa dan brawijaya jakarta saya berharap apa yang telah ditanam oleh grandsyaikh di damaskus akan segera tumbuh musimnya telah tiba musim untuk berkembang di seluruh timur dan barat serta utara dan selatan di mana mana orang akan mencari jalan menuju allah swt
2464152 seluruh hal yang allah percayakan kepadaku di malam isra aku telah tanamkan dalam hati abu bakar
2464153 selama melakukan pencarian aku bertemu 99 syaikh sebelum aku bertemu grandsyaikh qasim bin muhammad bin abu bakar as shiddiq q
2464154 terkadang seorang murid akan datang menemuiku dengan membawa sepotong kain yang cantik dan bertanya syaikh kami akan membuat kain ini menjadi sebuah kemeja ini bagus kan tentu saja aku akan mengatakan ya ini bagus untuk dibikin kemeja aku tidak bisa mengatakan kalau itu tidak bagus kemudian mereka berlalu dan berkata wah syaikh berkata kalau ini bagus selesai kalian harus mempercayainya tetapi ada kesalahan sebelum kalian menjahitnya kalian harus membawa kain itu pada saya dan berkata syaikh ku bagaimana aku harus menjahitnya bagaimana aku melakukannya bagaimana aku memotongnya lalu aku akan memotong kain itu kemudian mereka menjahitnya maka inilah keputusanku jangan datang mempunyai segala sesuatu telah tersedia lalu bertanya padaku apakah ini bagus tentu saja aku akan mengatakan kalau itu bagus sekalipun itu jelek karena kita tidak ingin mengecewakan seseorang
2464155 yang paling aku takuti dari umatku adalah sirik yang tersembunyi
2464156 aku milik syaikh ini atau syaikh itu atau syaikh itu

2464161 mit ist keine studie oder untersuchung bekannt die die dreickst nder wie kopietz meint als verkehrsgef hrdung einstuft sollte es jedoch unterlagen dazu geben muss die wiener sp diese dringend auf den tisch legen und zwar gemeinsam mit all den wirklich relevanten untersuchungen und studien die aber weil sie der wiener stadtregierung nicht genehm sind in den tiefen irgendwelcher rathaus schubladen verschwinden
2464162 der versuch des herrn kopietz eine werbeform zu diffamieren ist nichts als eine samst gliche nebelbombe und ein armseliges ablenkungsman ver vom umweltskandal am donaukanal
2464163 die wiener sp hat mit ihrer beteiligung an der gewista ein quasi monopol auf plakatwerbung in wien die halbschalen wurden ohne expertisen zur stadtbild pflege und ohne begutachtung ber verkehrsbehinderungen montiert und stellen keine kosteng nstige m glichkeit dar parteienwerbung zu machen
2464164 menschen mit vergiftungserscheinungen und hautausschlag nach dem verzehr von im donaukanal gefangenen fisch sollten dort auskunft ber behandlungsmethoden erhalten
2464165 verwenden sie ihre energie darauf die gesundheit der wienerinnen und wiener tats chlich zu erhalten und warnen sie umgehend die bev lkerung vor dem benutzen des donaukanals herr kopietz
2464166 anscheinend ist der sp mittlerweile jedes mittel recht um von ihren schlechten umfragewerten abzulenken und die werbem glichkeiten der kleineren parteien einzuschr nken
2464167 das angebot der gewista lehnen wir aus moralischen gr nden ab denn es darf nicht vergessen werden dass sich die dreieckst nder im besitz der jeweiligen partei befinden bei der nutzung der halbschalen jedoch w rde die sp als miteigent merin der gewista an jedem plakat mitverdienen dass kopietz solch ein unmoralisches angebot zu stellen wagt zeigt die arroganz der macht die sich inzwischen in der wiener sp breit gemacht hat
2464168 dass die sp jetzt halbschalen als alternative zu den dreieckst ndern ins spiel bringt ist glatter hohn wir sind nat rlich nicht gewillt mit unserer wahlwerbung das budget der sp aufzubessern

2464177 allah yang menghidupkan dan mematikan dan dia maha hidup tak akan mati ampunilah dosa ibuku fathimah binti asad dan bimbinglah hujjah nya pertanyaan di kubur dan luaskanlah atasnya kuburnya demi nabi mu dan demi para nabi sebelum mu sungguh engkau maha pengasih dari semua pemilik sifat kasih sayang

2464181 kau munafiq mengapa kau salat di belakang sayyidina ali tapi makan dari makanan yang dibagikan oleh muawiyah
2464182 mengapa tidak aku salat di belakang sayyidina ali karena salatnya lebih diterima di hadirat ilahi dan aku makan dengan makanan muawiyah karena makanannya lezat dan nimat
2464183 jangan bakar jari tangan kalian pada apa yang bukan tanggung jawab kalian pada apa yang bukan urusan kalian

2464188 aku mengirimkanmu untuk berkhalwat di antara 124 000 wali bahwa mereka melakukan khalwat mereka secara tersembunyi kaulah yang paling penting bagi kami perintah ini datang secara pribadi dan langsung dari nabi s kepada grandsyaikh dan kemudian kepada diriku
2464189 aku mengirimkanmu berkhalwat untuk satu alasan utama aku ingin agar kau bangun tiap malam selepas isya untuk melakukan rabithah ikatan batin spiritual red dengan diriku karena aku akan mengirmkan bagimu pesan pesan setelah pukul 1 30 di tengah malam bangunlah setelah melakukan berbagai doa yang berbeda kau mesti melakukan munajat aku akan pergi dengan dirimu begitu pula grandshaykh akan bersamamu pergi ke hadirat nabi s dan melakukan munajat itu langsung di hadapan hadirat suci beliau sall allahu alayhi wasallam
2464190 munajat ini dilakukan untuk satu tujuan utama untuk membunuh syaitan untuk menyelamatkan kemanusiaan dari kejahatan ego mereka

2464198 jika seseorang meninggalkan segala hal dan tak melakukan apapun dan berkata bahwa dia melakukan hal itu karena beriman pada tuhannya bahwa tuhannya akan mencukupi dia dan menyediakan apa yang hamba nya butuhkan maka sebenarnya orang itu sudah berdosa
2464199 dari sini aku akan menyerahkan segalanya pada tuhanku dan di titik ini aku percayakan segala urusanku pada tuhanku
2464200 aku percaya bahwa tuhanku akan memberiku masa panen maka dia telah sesat dalam berpikir dan berbuat
2464201 seseorang diberi bekal sebuah tongkat patah dan sebuah sekop dan diperintahkan untuk menggali tujuh lapis tanah bumi sampai lapisan yang terakhir dimana harta si murid tersimpan disana
2464202 allah tidak akan membebani siapapun diluar batas kemampuan hamba hamba nya
2464203 saya berbicara atas nama sayyidina al mahdi as karena beliau belum diizinkan untuk muncul dan mengatakan hal ini secara langsung pada publik tapi saya telah mendapatkan izin beliau saat beliau muncul maka kalian akan menjadi saksi bagaimana beliau akan berbicara

2464208 di alam semesta ini tidak ada yang lebih tinggi dariku
2464209 dia harus memiliki satu karakter masing masing dari tiga ekor binatang
2464210 dari keledai dia harus mampu menanggung beban dengan sabar dan tidak mengeluh jika dia tidak dapat melakukan hal itu maka dia tidak akan berhasil sebab tanpa kesabaran seseorang tidak akanbisa mengemban tanggung jawab didalam kehidupannya
2464211 hidup sebagai hamba dan menjauhi hal hal yang dilarang adalah lebih berharga dibandingkan ibadah seluruh malaikat manusia dan jinn selama hidupnya
2464212 mengapa aku harus mengeluh bila allah yang memerintahkan ini semua harus terjadi
2464213 oh kami orang turki tidak ada yang bisa seperti kami
2464214 engkau allah swt adalah tuhan di atas dan aku adalah tuhan di muka bumi
2464215 bagaimana kami menyesuaikandiri saat sesuatu muncul karena kami bukan orang orang terpelajar yang memiliki ilmu
2464216 dan kami menemukan kalau black hole menelan dan menarik segala sesuatu disekitarnya seperti sebuah penghisap apapun yang melintasinya akan dihisap dan yang dihisap akan menghilang
2464217 dan tidak hanya seperti binatang tetapi level mereka lebih rendah dari level binatang
2464218 bagaimana para ilmuwan terus menerus mengkaji dan meneliti secara kritis berbagai aspek dari teori evolusi
2464219 tampaknya redupnya darwinisme secara cepat di amerika serikat akan berlanjut terus di tahun tahun mendatang
2464220 ketika firaun mengaku dirinya tuhan iblis berlari dan menggigil ketakutan karena mengetahui akan turunnya kemurkaan allah azza wa jalla bahkan iblispun mengakui adanya tuhan sementara sebagian manusia dungu karena kesombonggan nya tidak mengakui adanya tuhan
2464221 saya berpikir kalau suatu saat nanti saya dapat menjadi seorang manusia
2464222 wahai syaikh ku kami berpikir jika seandainya suatu saat kami bisa menjadi seorang manusia dan kami pikir kami tak akan mampu menanggung beban sebagai manusia
2464223 aku mencoba mencari dari jenis monyet apakah aku berasal darwin berkata kakek moyangku mungkin adalah orang utan
2464224 anda tidak terlalu mirip seperti orang utan bagi saya anda lebih mirip dengan gorilla yang demikian buruk saya pikir anda tidaklah lebih jelek dari gorilla

2464226 islamic beliefs and doctrine according to ahl al sunnamawlana syaikh hisyam kabbani ar rabbani
2464227 kalian telah tampil ke depan dengan cara terbaik untuk tampil kedepan kalian telah kembali dari jihad yang lebih kecil kepada jihad yang lebih besar
2464228 perjuangan mujahadat hamba hamba allah atas hawa nafsu ego mereka
2464229 perkataan ini tersebar luas dan ini adalah perkataan ibrahim ibn ablah menurut nisai dalam al kuna ghazali menyebutnya dalam ihya ulumuddin nya dan al iraqi berkata bahwa bayhaqi meriwayatkannya dari jabir dan berkata ada kelemahan dalam rantai periwayatannya
2464230 mereka yang berjuang berjihad demi kami akan kami bimbing mereka ke dalam jalan jalan kami
2464231 mereka yang berjihad atas hawa nafsu mereka dan bertaubat demi kami kami akan membimbing mereka pada jalan ketulusan dan seseorang tak akan dapat berjihad melawan musuhnya di luar dirinya yaitu dengan pedang kecuali ia yang telah berjihad melawan musuh musuh ini dalam dirinya kemudian siapa yang telah menang atas musuh musuh dalam dirinya akan pula menang atas musuh musuhnya di luar dan siapa yang kalah oleh musuh musuh dalam dirinya maka musuh di luar dirinya akan mengalahkannya
2464232 maukah kalian kuberitahu sesuatu yang terbaik di antara semua amal merupakan amal salih terbaik di mata tuhan kalian meninggikan derajat kalian di akhirat dan memiliki keutamaan lebih besar daripada membelanjakan emas dan perak di jalan allah atau berperan serta dalan jihad dan membunuh atau terbunuh di jalan allah
2464233 meski seseorang menebas orang orang kafir dan musyrikin dengan pedangnya sampai pedang itu patah dan ia benar benar terselimuti dengan darah mereka al mudzakkirin para ahli dzikir pengingat allah ada di atas mereka satu derajat
2464234 mengapa saya melakukan itu mengapa saya mengatakan hal seperti ini
2464235 aku berlindung kepada allah dari pengetahuan yang tidak membawa manfaat kepada orang yang bersangkutan atau bagi kemanusiaan aku juga berlindung kepada allah dari kejahatan ego yang hanya menginginkan kesenangan dan kenikmatan fisik tidak ada yang lain
2464236 aku datang untuk menghilangkan karakteristik buruk ego manusia aku datang untuk menyandangkan kalian dengan kualitas terbaik nilai terbaik pakaian terbaik kalian sehingga kalian akan berada di hadirat ilahi dengan pakaian ilahi yang terbaik dan paling berharga
2464237 wahai tuhanku jika ada lebih banyak lagi aku mohon agar mereka dikirimkan kepadaku kirimkanlah padaku orang orang dengan keinginan egonya mereka akan temukan bahwa apa yang mereka inginkan ada pada levelku
2464238 aku adalah hamba mu dan engkau adalah penciptaku tuhan pemilik surga
2464239 aku adalah hamba mu yang lemah dan engkau adalah tuhanku
2464240 oh anakku aku bisa saja menahan sakitku tetapi aku tidak akan menjadi anjing seperti anjing itu
2464241 jika para pengikutku dan orang orang desa mengenalku seperti aku mengenali diriku ini maka mereka niscaya tidak akan mengizinkan aku tinggal bersama mereka bahkan mereka akanmelempariku dengan batu dan mengusirku
2464242 jika iman seluruh ummatku ditimbang dengan imannya abu bakar maka imannya abu bakar akan lebih berat
2464243 wahai shiddiq yang tidak patuh dalam pandanganku apapun yang mereka katakan kamu harus bertaubat dan memohon ampun
2464244 tak seorang pun dapat mencium realitas iman kecuali dia memandang level egonya lebih buruk daripada firaun namrud setan dan abu jahal
2464245 baiklah aku terima aku memang seperti itu egoku yang terburuk
2464246 pelajaran ini diperuntukkan untuk seorang tamu yang berkata bahwa dia tidak memerlukan seorang guru yang masih hidup tetapi dengan memurnikan dirinya dia dapat berhubungan dengan inner guide pembimbing dalam dirinya
2464247 tak perlu mengganggu orang itu kalian hanya membuang waktu dan energi pertahanannya tak tertembus seribu kali serangan sama sia sianya dengan satu kali serangan biarkan dia sendiri dia telah lari dari tangan kita
2464248 mengapa aku harus mematuhimu dalam segala hal dan kamu tidak mematuhiku
2464249 jika kamu tidak mematuhi perintahku aku akan memberi garam pada matamu jika garam ada dimatamu maka kamu sama sekali tidak akan bisa tidur jika kamu lakukan itu aku akan lakukan ini
2464250 semakin banyak kita dimurnikan maka gelombang hikmah ilahi dapat ditangkap oleh telinga hati kita
2464251 wahai hamba ku engkau membersihkan mulutnya demi aku dan aku membersihkan hatinya untukmu
2464252 ego kita adalah makhluk duniawi sedangkan ruh kita adalah makhluk surgawi kemudian terjadi kecamuk di antara keduanya dua sisi yang berlawanan dan berlainan jenis sisi material yang mewakili ego dan bertempur melawan jiwa ruh kita yang merupakan perwakilan surgawi dalam diri kita

2464268 wahai tuhanku ampunilah aku yang telah melibatkan diri dalam apa yang bukan untukku aku telah mencampuri urusan yang hanya milik mu wahai sultan ampunilah aku dan lakukanlah seperti kehendak mu
2464269 aku ini hanya untuk mu ya allah dan semua yang kulakukan adalah hanya untuk mu setiap saat untuk meraih ridha mu dan setiap perbuatanku hanya untuk mu wahai tuhan kami untuk menyenangkan mu
2464270 wahai tuhanku aku melangkah untuk mu tolonglah hamba mu ini dengan pertolongan ilahiah mu bila engkau ridha padaku maka aku dapat melawan egoku dan memindahkan gunung gunung yang tinggi
2464271 maksud dari penciptaan adalah untuk menikmati diriku sendiridengan makan minum dengan olimpiade dengan segala sesuatu itu adalah maksud penciptaan
2464272 kami tidak mau melakukan ini kami bahagia dengan ego kami dengan kesenangan kesenangan fisik kami kami bahagia kenapa kau menyuruh kami kepada jalan yang lain

2464280 siapa pun yang menerima bayah inisiasi dari kami atau menghadiri majelis dzikir kami mesti mengetahui bahwa dirinya telah hadir di gua tsur bersama nabi muhammad saw dan abu bakar as sidiq ra disaat nabi saw hijrah dari makkah ke madinah di saat barakah itu di hadirat nabi sall allahu alaihi wasallam dan bahwa ia telah menerima semua rahasia rahasia ini kemudian rahasia rahasia ini telah disampaikan kepada kami melalui para syaikh dari sanad emas melalui abu bakr as siddiq ra
2464281 jalur transmisi ini tidaklah disebut sebagai naqsyabandi saat itu tapi dikenal sebagai anak anak dari abu bakr as siddiq dan beliau abu bakr dikenal oleh para wali sebagai bapak dari jalur sanad ini
2464282 kemudian allah swt memerintahkan nabi saw untuk menyuruh abu bakr as siddiq untuk memanggil seluruh syaikh guru dari sanad emas yang merupakan pewaris dari abu bakr abu bakr memanggil para grandsyaikh dari sanad emas seluruh dari mereka dari zamannya hingga ke zaman al mahdi alaihissalam
2464283 abu bakr as siddiq dengan perintah nabi saw memerintahkan setiap grandsyaikh untuk mengumpul kan pengikut pengikutnya untuk hadir secara spiritual
2464284 aku harus tetap mengatakan ampuni aku ya allah aku berlindung hanya kepada mu 15 karena setiap kali aku mengatakan itu maka diperlukan satu kalimat itu lagi untuk menutupi kalimat yang sebelumnya
2464285 murid yang sesungguhnya dalam tariqah naqshbandi haqqani adalah sahabat penolong dan pendukung dari setiap pembela sayyidina muhammad sall allahu alayhi wasallam dan adalah tugas kita untuk bersahabat dan berasosiasi dengan para pembela seperti itu karena mereka berada pada jalan mawlana tak peduli apakah mereka adalah naqshbandi atau bukan
2464286 tujuan kita adalah untuk melindungi serta melukiskan nabi muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam dan sifat sifat beliau yang luhur dan agung baginya sholawat dan salam serta bagi ahli bait dan sahabat sahabat beliau yang untuk ini allah mendukung kita

2464312 syekhku adalah egoku setiap saat saya selalu bertanya kepada ego saya dan mendengar apa yang ego perintahkan apapun perintah ego saya melakukan sebaliknya sebab sepanjang pengetahuan saya ego hanya ingin menghancurkan jiwa setelah saya mendapat jawaban barulah saya mengucap kalimat syahadah
2464313 o syekhku selama 25 tahun apapun yang ego katakan saat saya menanyakan pendapat saya melakukan sebaliknya
2464314 aku telah mengajar kalian selama 40 atau 45 tahun dan tak ada satupun yang berusaha menjinakkan egonya orang yang tidak beriman itu bisa memperoleh kekuatan yang mengagumkan kekuatan kata kata karena dia melakukan hal yang bertentangan dengan yang egonya mau sedangkan kalian aku memerintahkan kalian melawan ego membunuh ego kalian agar menjadi hamba yang baik tapi kalian tidak menurutinya untuk alasan itulah kekuatan surga tidak pernah terbuka bagi kalian ambillah hikmah dari cerita ini sebagai bahan pemikiran dan jadilah hamba yang baik dan dari allah lah semua keberhasilan wa min allah at tawfiq bihurmati habib fatihah setan musuh terbesar manusia sulthanul awliya mawlana syaikh nazim adil al haqqani lefke cyprus 5 maret 2006 auudzubillaahi minasy syaythaanir rajiim bismillaahir rahmaanir rahiim allaahumma shalli alaa sayyidinaa muhammadiw wa alaa aalihi wa shahbihi ajmaiin as salamu alaikum tidak ada salaam bagi musuh

2464321 i saw the injury when it happened and obviously everyones body responds a little bit different so his bodys response will be different from other guys but one thing that i do think and believe is that hes a pretty quick healer
2464322 i kept on a read zone right around the outside and went to turn up and just couldnt do what i normally did
2464323 i didnt go down i just did a little hop and skip and they came to check me out and put a little ice on it

2464331 il mio consiglio di pensare come in un futuro litalia possa diventare pi solidale e un paese in cui tutti possano avere opportunit e dove litalia possa tornare a giocare un ruolo importante in europa io ho bisogno di voi il pse ha bisogno che il partito socialista sia un partito forte abbiamo bisogno dellitalia nel tavolo delle decisioni fate la vostra scelta conclude fate la scelta giusta scegliete la sinistra scegliete il partito socialista
2464332 votate per enrico boselli ha detto un uomo integro coerente nei valori e negli ideali in italia a bruxelles e nel mondo
2464333 quello di cui hanno bisogno gli europei ha detto schulz unitalia a favore delleuropa e abbiamo bisogno di una leadership socialista ecco perch abbiamo bisogno del massimo dei vostri voti per le vostre liste per il vostro partito e penso che i miei amici e i miei colleghi che siedono con me nel mio gruppo stiano tutti lottando per gli stessi obiettivi che voi state perseguendo in italia in questa campagna elettorale
2464334 dalle ceneri e dalle rovine di una societ lideale del socialismo rinasce come laraba fenice
2464335 i diritti ha detto boselli valgono molto ma costano poco
2464336 bertinotti ha aggiunto ci ha rivolto un appello per un patto sulla laicita dopo le elezioni facciamolo subito
2464337 in italia ce il rischio concreto di una dittatura clericale
2464338 da un lato ce la destra clerico fascista peggiore deuropa spiega grillini che non solo sposa in toto la ragioni di una chiesa che pretende di trasformare il reato in peccato ma fa in modo che in parlamento non passi uno spillo di norme sgradite oltretevere
2464339 il pd dice grillini si appresta a far eleggere 120 parlamentari cattolici la maggior parte dei quali integralisti non esiste alcun partito al mondo prosegue grillini alludendo alla senatrice binetti che elegga signore con il cilicio e membri dellopus dei
2464340 che vinca il pd o il pdl in questo paese non cambiera nulla riguardo le liberta e i diritti civili perche 120 parlamentari del pd si troveranno sistematicamente a votare con la destra contro ogni norma che non piaccia al vaticano

2464347 one day you can do this from then on i decided to become a soldier he spent 18 years as a paratrooper leading bayonet charges in angola winning several medals and generally being not really a pacifist on leaving the army he came to england hed had some dealings with honey in the past with his family keeping 1000 hives which wasnt much by way of size in south africa but is huge by uk standards he says he looked around the uk sector and felt the general standards were absolutely appalling he was stunned at the lack of technical knowledge about honey british honey has evolved over the years to be a choice of runny or set he explains everythings mixed together the cropping methods used by the average beekeeper are laughable appalling the quality control is non existent hygiene control in the industry is the worst in the world peruvian peasants have got better hygiene standards than your average british beekeeper 60 percent of the members of the bhfa are operating in a totally illegal manner and they call themselves the trade organization i wouldnt join that organisation if it came to me on bended knees
2464348 just shows how slack the industry is if we can do it everyone can
2464349 starbucks original success had a lot to do with the fact that it introduced european coffee culture to a market that didnt have this tradition australia has a fantastic and rich coffee culture and companies like starbucks really struggle to compete with that
2464350 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
2464351 starbucks was snubbed by many australians who have grown up on a diet of quality european style coffee introduced in the last century to australia by immigrants especially from italy

2464353 for redress of grievances specifically illegal political advertising practices by the new york times and moveon org
2464354 in order to be fair newspapers and tv arent allowed to discount political or advocacy ads so they cannot favor one side
2464355 on sunday we read that it would run monday and the ad that appeared on monday said the testimony was happening
2464356 what would the times editorial page say if george bush attempted to justify his conduct with this kind of explanation
2464357 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them

2464363 filled with chop suey houses gambling dens and dance halls little manila was the area in stockton notoriously called skid row but it was also the closest thing filipinos had to a hometown in its heyday in the 30s this lively area had the largest population of filipinos outside of the philippines we tell the story of jimmy ente jr a longtime stockton resident recruited to work in the asparagus fields jimmy and many other like him faced backbreaking work low wages and at times extreme racism to fulfill their dreams narrated by famed filipino american producer dean devlin independence day the patriot this documentary tells the immigrant story as filipinos experienced it

2464369 particularly important to note on this day is the continuing struggle of filipino world war ii veterans to receive the veterans benefits they rightfully deserve during world war ii filipino and american troops fought bravely together under some of the most trying conditions suffered by any forces during that conflict forging a historic bond between our two nations and their people filipinos displayed great courage alongside american soldiers at bataan and corregidor only to be denied their just benefits by our government the veterans benefits enhancement act of 2007 would honor the service of all u s veterans including these filipino world war ii heroes the senate passed this bill last april i urge my colleagues in congress to take note of this day to honor the heroic service of filipino world war ii veterans by finally turning this important legislation into law

2464379 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
2464380 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
2464381 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
2464382 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2464383 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2464384 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
2464385 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
2464386 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
2464387 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2464388 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2464389 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2464390 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2464391 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2464392 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
2464393 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
2464394 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2464395 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts
2464396 ive heard people speak of it as a level of humility about understanding different cultures thats quite appropriate
2464397 i think its a very well done and justifiable recommendation
2464398 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
2464399 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
2464400 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
2464401 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
2464402 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
2464403 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
2464404 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
2464405 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
2464406 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic

2464413 research has continued to demonstrate that growth in the cognitive line is necessary but not sufficient for the growth in the other lines
2464414 you have to be aware of something in order to act on it moral feel it emotional identity with it self sense or need it needs

2464436 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2464437 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2464438 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2464439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2464440 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2464441 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2464442 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2464443 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2464515 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2464516 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
2464517 you were tired out by the length of your road yet you did not say it is hopeless you found renewed strength therefore you did not faint
2464518 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2464519 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2464520 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2464521 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2464522 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful

2464526 fans of the tolkien books and the marvel comics had very clear ideas of who those characters were like
2464527 which of course isnt ian at all and ian is openly gay and well known for his activism in gay rights we anticipated a certain amount of homophobic reaction
2464528 he was able to win people over before they saw the first frame of the movie

2464534 lebanon is like a little red hot chilli pepper its a tiny place a concentrated explosive example of whats happening in global geo politics it could be a model of anywhere else you could actually say lebanon is all of us in a lot of ways
2464535 the true fears and doubts of any nation state become particularly and painfully visible at its borders rather than in some notional centre and if this is true at the border of lebanon and israel occupied palestine it is also true on the sand and surf of our eastern seaboard

2464541 sehingga upaya restrukturisasi dan reposisi perangkat daerah ke depan nanti benar benar sesuai dengan semangat good government agar kinerja pemerintahan daerah dilakukan secara efisien dan efektif serta didukung aparatur profesional
2464542 im so sorry that all of this is happening come home and ill make it worth your while
2464543 it was striking that ceos of companies of all different sizes and geographic coverage were engaged and enthusiastic about these topics which suggests optimization is crucial whatever the current geographic scale
2464544 we need to move away from an operational focus to a client interface focus
2464545 are you effectively integrating differentiating capabilities knowledge and assets from around the world into networked centers of excellence does your organization have a globally integrated business design even if it does not have a global footprint do you have a detailed plan for global partnering and m amp a are you developing leaders that think and act globally do you nurture and support social connections to improve integration and innovation
2464546 the key for doing business abroad is not to seek homogeneity instead we must be able to work effectively with people of different cultures and from different countries we can learn this by working collaboratively with them
2464547 now even as we speak there are those who are preparing to divide us the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
2464548 oh i think he still speaks about it and im sure itll be a theme at our convention
2464549 is there any polite way for me to tell him not to come all the time
2464550 if we have a newspaper man along our pleasure will be destroyed
2464551 no one knows how significant the decrease will be but theyre betting that it will be more significant than less if thats the case then logic should dictate that the ongoing earnings power of those companies should be less because they have fewer assets upon which to earn money
2464552 that has implications for the extension of credit and the deployment of capital by those institutions
2464553 you think you make any money in investment banking away from this part of it
2464554 investment bankers are loss leaders youre paying these very ordinary guys two million three million million and a half for what they do one deal a year maybe your balls are on the line with the leveraged lending part of it and you dont get paid for the risk you get to the point where thats your business and your business is flawed
2464555 massive sea change salvation i dont see it hope hope exists hope it comes back
2464556 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
2464557 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is a friend of the united states and even israel
2464558 it is apparent that iran has not yet perfected uranium enrichment and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs is being impaired
2464559 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2464560 in his closed door meeting with house democrats tuesday night presumptive democratic nominee barack obama delivered a real zinger according to a witness suggesting that he was beginning to believe his own hype
2464561 obama was waxing lyrical about last weeks trip to europe when he concluded according to the meeting attendee this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for the 200 000 souls who thronged to his speech in berlin came not just for him he told the enthralled audience of congressional representatives i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions he said according to the source
2464562 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2464563 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others
2464564 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2464565 rioters hang another negro mobs in springfield ill defying 3 000 soldiers string up old and innocent victim
2464566 at the crucial moment chinas mens soccer team stood up and proved to the world that nothing ever changes it lost
2464567 the national soccer team lost again we have nothing to say
2464568 although we want to solve the problem we have decided that there are only certain ways we can fund it and i think that limits us in trying to find a solution to the problem
2464569 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2464570 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2464571 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2464572 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2464573 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2464574 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2464575 selling a baby is the same as selling a car the only difference is the price if china could sell some of its population to the west then there would be fewer people here and we would have more money
2464576 this is a historic moment in the struggle for animal rights
2464577 it will doubtless be remembered as a key moment in the defense of our evolutionary comrades
2464578 there is no sound moral reason why possession of basic rights should be limited to members of a particular species
2464579 killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person
2464580 animal experimentation has been essential to the development of all cardiac surgery transplantation surgery joint replacement and all vaccinations
2464581 for us he is high risk for sure high gain only maybe
2464582 anyway the united states could elect osama bin laden as president and american middle east policy would not change it is that locked in for israel
2464583 give me a call well bring you into the office
2464584 the u s in the world how they see us
2464585 why should we take the time for foreign media since there is obamania around the world
2464586 you will find it not mysterious when you have become familiar with it it will not be as mysterious as before
2464587 is a dream of china a china that probably never existed except in my boyhood fantasies
2464588 opium potions fortune tellers concubines blood soot fish paste tan gives readers the details we have been craving all along
2464589 the fannie and freddie situation is actually a lot better than certainly the fear would have indicated
2464590 government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy
2464591 by removing regulatory accounting and tax impediments to raising capital
2464592 and that a pleasant one with a garden and trees and room for the children to play in safety must be a strong motive with any man to regularity good conduct and economy
2464593 the most sacred place for man and for woman and especially for children
2464594 feels a love for it a thankfulness for its possession and a proportionate determination to uphold and defend it against all invading influences such a man is of necessity a good citizen for he has a stake in society
2464595 give us a nation of homes with each family loving and beautifying and developing its own
2464596 that a healthy happy worker in a decent home is worth more both to the state and his employer than one who is an unhealthy unhappy wanderer from one factory and slum to another
2464597 as is the home so the community and the nation
2464598 the sanctuary of our loftiest ideals the source of the spiritual energy of our people
2464599 governed by a bunch of people who go to bed at 10 only drink ginger beer never try to look up their secretaries skirts and are quite happy to get paid 4 50 an hour in short were going to be governed by bores and failures
2464600 an amount greater than the combined market capitalization of all but the three largest publicly held p ublishing companies
2464601 it wasnt pretty folks but didnt we have fun esquire in the sixties
2464602 uncovering the sixties the life and times of the undergro und press
2464603 for the first year and a half of our existence all we did was try to figure out how to fit into the regulatory environment
2464604 we tried to establish common law rather than canon law
2464605 we set out to build a new role for the u s in the world by experience rather than doctrine
2464606 i dont think i would have called it a war on terror
2464607 a bad phrase its a criminal problem this is not the soviets coming back lets not hyperventilate
2464608 knew that as a black man there was nothing that you couldnt achieve in atlanta
2464609 government wastes a lot of money we pay in taxes
2464610 eventually the household computer will be as much a part of the home as the kitchen sink
2464611 for a purpose that has nothing to do with public health
2464612 incredibly irresponsible story from any reasonable perspective the fact is the rate was completely in line
2464613 the inclusion of information in the story about countrywide is irrelevant the obamas got their loan from northern trust the rhetorical purpose of the details about countrywide is to create an appearance that the obamas got a special deal because mr obama is a senator
2464614 frankly any reasonably savvy borrower should have been able to do better than average that context was missing
2464615 this was not a unique situation it is common and consistent business policy which shows no favoritism toward politicians celebrities or any public figures his rate was based on the fact this is a client who could potentially bring us more personal business
2464616 tilted over to any reader into a story of preferential treatment not justified by the facts the fact that obama is a u s senator is immaterial
2464617 there doesnt seem to be much of a story here
2464618 25 years of harm minimisation being the root of the problem
2464619 the evidence received in the course of this inquiry has shown there is a drug industry which pushes harm reduction and minimisation at the expense of harm prevention and treatment which has as its aim making an individual drug free
2464620 and so the lion fell in love with l te lamb
2464621 non mi va di essere sempre loise lane voglio essere anche superman
2464622 correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
2464623 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
2464624 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
2464625 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
2464626 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
2464627 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
2464628 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
2464629 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
2464630 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
2464631 tu sei beh non esattamente lamore della mia vita perch mi aspetto di amarti molto pi a lungo sei lamore della mia esistenza
2464632 secondo la tradizione tu dovresti sostenere la mia posizione e io la tua
2464633 ed ecco tornare il mio incubo alla anna dai capelli rossi
2464634 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
2464635 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
2464636 sai nana in mezzo a qualunque folla io mi trovi in qualunque forma tu appaia
2464637 whynt you toss your bike in the back of my truck and ill take ya home
2464638 how deep into the jungles are you going joe be sure and take the gun
2464639 hello kitty deve morire hello kitty deve morire e tutti lo possono ammazzare
2464640 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
2464641 vuoi che canti per te canter tutta la notte se ci terr via i cattivi sogni
2464642 e certo anche la pubblicit che ti fa vedere lo sporco sui denti

2464644 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2464645 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2464646 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2464647 lleg al descaro de felicitar al contralor clodosbaldo russi n por los servicios prestados a la revoluci n
2464648 ese rgano responde a intereses subalternos ajenos a su verdadera naturaleza all no se discutieron los t rminos y principios jur dicos que esgrimieron entre otros leopoldo l pez sino que se toman en cuenta las l neas pol ticas que traza el jefe del proceso pol tico para lo cual si es menester desconocer y pisotear la constituci n lo har n como en efecto est ocurriendo

2464650 esta sentencia est ligadita a la manera como se pretende imponer la reforma rechazada por el pueblo el pasado 2 de diciembre o sea que se ejecuta un contrabando constitucional que no podemos tolerar
2464651 con la formalizaci n de mi candidatura est mas cerca el xito este 23 de noviembre donde le dar continuidad a todos los programas y obras buenas de la gesti n de edward capdevielle cuento con la capacidad y disponibilidad para trabajar por y para el colectivo
2464652 yo creo que nosotros tenemos que desde la alcald a del municipio piar aprovechar un recurso humano por el ejemplo como es el diputado gustavo mu iz quien debe seguir haciendo un trabajo para el engrandecimiento del municipio pretendemos trabajar en funci n de la seguridad con las instituciones p blicas nacionales que est n dirigidas desde miraflores ya que es un tema que necesita de la mancomunidad de esfuerzos
2464653 en nuestro prop sito cambiarle el rostro de manera radical a la ciudad hacerla mucho m s humana y que podamos revivir momentos tan estelares de su historia como cuando cumpli 200 a os en 1962
2464654 nosotros tenemos que desarrollar una paciencia china en esto porque estamos convencidos que la victoria nos corresponde y que de alguna manera nada nos sacar del camino democr tico constitucional y electoral
2464655 for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it
2464656 on this day jawaharlal nehru had passed this resolution and sardar patel seconded it
2464657 the aim of organizing such functions is to remember those bygone days the way the freedom fighters laid down their lives for the country we rarely get such occasions
2464658 we are ready to meet union home minister shivraj patil individually as we have put forth our view point before the centre
2464659 the constitution of an apex body for management of maritime affairs is an important step which would facilitate quick decision making and rapid response
2464660 this we think is not the right thing to do
2464661 we need to have an organisational structure in which representatives of these ministries sit together to take action required when there is an emergency
2464662 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2464663 god called them home and he called them at a good time
2464664 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2464665 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2464666 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2464667 una maglietta solidale che vuole essere una possibilit per continuare a sperare per tutti i bambini e gli adolescenti ricoverati presso la clinica oncoematologica pediatrica a padova
2464668 unidea che nata per sdrammatizzare ma considerato il loro successo le magliette di mascalzone veneto potranno essere richieste nel sito internet www raffaelezanon it ed i proventi verranno devoluti interamente alla clinica di oncoematologia pediatrica che necessita di una camera sterile nella sezione di trapianto di midollo e di fondi per la ricerca e lampliamento della struttura indossare questa maglietta significa restituire ai bambini e agli adolescenti ricoverati nella clinica la voglia di sognare ancora e magari di sognare insieme a loro
2464669 accetto qualsiasi sfida contro chi mi taccia di essere inconcludente o incoerente spiega il consigliere al di l di valutazioni politiche non accettabile che un rappresentante di una istituzione leda la mia onorabilit facendosi forte del proprio potere i miei avvocati stanno predisponendo unazione giudiziale civile per un adeguato risarcimento siamo in uno stato di diritto e nessuno si fa giustizia da s quindi non c altra via che ricorrere alla magistratura in questa fase politica il signore del nord est mi sembra come maria antonietta che ha proposto brioche al popolo che chiedeva pane
2464670 orwell is as pertinent to the world now as he ever was
2464671 his incredibly distinctive writing and thinking about political matters his extraordinary decency the internet allows the diaries to be more digestible for the average reader you can find out what he was thinking on a certain date
2464672 i went to the archive and zoomed through the diaries and just wept they show orwell practicing being a writer and an observer you see in the diaries he smells out orthodoxies and presses them until he and the reader are more critical
2464673 warmish day with showers after the rain enormous slugs crawling about one measuring about 3
2464674 i have known since about 1931 stephen spender says he has known since 1929 that the future must be catastrophic i could not say exactly what wars and revolutions would happen but they never surprised me when they came since 1934 i have known war between england and germany was coming and since 1936 i have known it with complete certainty
2464675 it is clear from what american papers one gets hold of that anti british feeling is in full cry and that all the isolationists after a momentary retirement have re emerged with the same slogans as before what always horrifies me about american anti british sentiment is its appalling ignorance ditto presumably with anti american feeling in england
2464676 because he is one of the few writers who brings comfort and understanding to everyone who lives in totalitarian societies of which there are many around he believes that writing and thinking are the front line against lies and injustice he is an eloquent original uncontrollable writer on the side of justice since when is that not relevant
2464677 the greatest concentration of football talent ever assembled for a single game
2464678 many of the viewers were not regular watchers of pro football and they were seeing something starkly different than the traditional college games played on sunny autumn afternoons
2464679 this was more like mortal combat from some dark underworld as in some medieval rite the players on both sidelines were draped in long capes
2464680 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2464681 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche

2464692 the thing is as a prosecutor friend of mine wrote me during the ceremony we dont know cant know how much is genuine and how much is not how happy anyone is because in a one party dictatorship we know only what they want us to know and one thing we know is they dont want us to know much
2464693 my friend was sick at heart by what he considered the fawning coverage of the opening on the cbc
2464694 china may have a lot of new ronald mcdonald statues and wave a lot of hankies in unison

2464696 most of them have been failing to manage their schools due to many files kept in their offices but with access to computers work will run smoothly

2464698 this good ranking is timely and an indication of the improved performance of the university it website is the ultimate platform that positions our university to prove its dominance in the country and region
2464699 im not surprised by the good ranking since this website is user friendly
2464700 if the web performance of an institution is below the expected position of their academic excellence university authorities should reconsider their web policy and promote substantial increases of the volume and quality of their electronic publications
2464701 i have witnessed some unusual performances from them rwandan swimmers but i hope this is stress
2464702 weve been doing some serious training since we arrived here beijing with a view to acclimatise with the weather
2464703 they were impressive in the competitive pool national aquatics centre two days ago but because its far weve decided to train from the village
2464704 we have immunised 94 of the infants we now have 8 vaccines to immunise against tuberculosis diphtheria tetanus whooping cough hepatitis influenza measles polio
2464705 we have enough logistics like vaccines and syringes and have a distribution plan the target population is those between 0 12 months this year we are targeting 395 328 infants
2464706 we receive logistics twice a year from different manufacturers around the world through who recommendations and purchase them through unicef
2464707 every year measles was killing 7000 out of 800 000 infants in the country
2464708 the health system was destroyed by the war and genocide of 1994 human resource base rendered insufficient
2464709 health education community mobilisation search for dropouts organization of outreach sessions notification of diseases service delivery oral rehydration salts ors vitamin a
2464710 last year 2007 we used 6 million for immunisation the government provided 32 global alliance for vaccine and immunisation gavi gave us 64 who world health organisation provided 3 and unicef united nations children emergency fund gave us 1 of the money
2464711 the health centers which include preventive care like immunisation family planning and consultation then the second level is at district level it includes district hospitals there are doctors in four sections pediatrics surgery gynecologists the third level we have referral hospitals and here are the specialists
2464712 a pregnant woman should be injected against tetanus when the pregnancy is at 3 and 6 months old
2464713 at birth the child receives bcg and polio vaccines after 6 weeks he receives the second dose of diphtheria tetanus whooping cough hepatitis b and influenza vaccines the third dose is in 10 weeks and is a repeat of the previous vaccines then the fourth is at the ninth month with the measles vaccine
2464714 the women who dont return with children between 6 to 14 weeks are 3 then those between 6 to 9 months are 9
2464715 we send health teams into the communities and they reach out to families reminding them to take the children for immunisation we also carry community campaigns teaching the masses the importance of immunisation
2464716 i expect you to acquire working methodologies in line with disaster preparedness from this workshop which will help us in developing strong community based disaster preparedness programs
2464717 disaster preparedness is a continuous and integrated process resulting from a wide range of activities and resources rather than from a distinct activity so this work is of paramount importance to us in setting up great response strategies to disaster
2464718 the risk of avian influenza epizootic and pandemic in africa has increased following detection of h5n 1 virus in a number of countries

2465169 the meeting was very much focused on the sporting agenda they discussed sochi the russian city hosting the 2014 winter olympics there was no discussion of any political or global incidents

2465198 it puts all of us christian bikers in a negative light that all of a sudden were gangs too
2465199 were not all thugs and dont have gang behavior we have to go out and do gods work

2465222 maritime terrorism across national boundaries has gained momentum in the indian ocean armed aggression has increased and multinational cooperation is required to curb it
2465223 an apex body needs to be formed to manage maritime affairs for quick decision making and rapid response currently the fisheries and other resources are under agriculture ministry shipping is under a separate ministry
2465224 we need to have an organisational structure in which representatives of both these ministries sit together along with the indian navy so that we can take action that will be required when there is an emergency situation

2465235 he may go to chicago and six months later decide that raising the level of urgency would come by moving at least part of the management team to the west coast
2465236 sanjay has very rigorous operational discipline and he knows the processes here that have been inconsistent
2465237 and i really feel that i can make a difference
2465238 the sort of things i feel strongly about nobody seems to organise a protest about very much really
2465239 this is the first report of its kind and it makes far reaching recommendations which when implemented will impact very positively on patients and their families
2465240 the commission which was established in january 2007 sets out a clear and comprehensive road map for driving improvements in safety and quality across our health service
2465241 perhaps the most significant recommendation of the report is the introduction of a licensing system for all health services whether they are delivered publicly or privately the current system whereby anybody can open a hospital for example does not adequately offer patients the protection they need and deserve
2465242 all of us working in the delivery of health care must make every effort to minimise error and maximise quality a blame free reporting and management culture is undoubtedly in the best interests of patients
2465243 i very much welcome the finding of the commission that the absence of accountability arrangements such as quality assurance clinical audit measurement and monitoring which involve professionals especially doctors limits the extent to which patients can be protected recent patient safety incidents can be attributed in large part to this i therefore also welcome the many recommendation they have made to address this situation
2465244 recent years have seen great improvements in our health system life expectancy survival from cancer mortality from heart disease and many other measures have seen improvements which are greater than many other countries what i now want to see is that we show similar improvements in the safety and quality of the services we provide
2465245 i want to see a system wide nationwide patient proofed health service that can be monitored and measured this will ensure that we move from pockets of best practice to a situation where patients throughout the country can benefit from the same high standard of quality and safety
2465246 one of the most common complaints i hear from patients and their families is the difficulty they encounter in getting information this report advocates open communication and i very much support the enhanced and meaningful involvement of patients and their families
2465247 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2465248 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2465249 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2465250 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2465251 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2465252 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2465253 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2465262 the two other options have many more qualities of safety and less cost that would be there if they looked at them
2465263 but we dont know if in the end we would purchase we have a resource strategy now that is really trying to de emphasize hydro a bit and it would have to be clean hydro that is as environmentally friendly before wed purchase it

2465267 this is an attempt to create a rift between the lebanese army and the government by those who stood against the army during the battle for nahr al bared in an attempt to cover up that fact
2465268 the purpose of the visit was very clear what he discussed was our commitment to help lebanon to build a strong state and a strong army especially after the great sacrifices this army has made in nahr al bared
2465269 the lebanese people at all levels expressed a desire to establish a strong state and a strong army capable of defending lebanon as happened in nahr al bared
2465270 the 60 protective effect against hiv acquisition over the first 24 months of the study we now find to be sustained and possibly strengthened to approximately 65 over three and a half years of follow up

2465275 when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house
2465276 have you not read that from the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let no one separate
2465277 why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her

2465307 just a continuation of the growing nature of steaming media
2465308 weve been policing this with the march madness spikes you get in the states but obviously this is on a grander scale its happening over a longer time scale during the work week and its the first time theres been this type of capability so were in uncharted areas to some degree
2465309 its hard to give you fixed numbers but in some past cases streaming media has drained significant amounts of bandwidth people might access and leave on an olympics feed that will churn a ton of bandwidth its not just the productivity drain its the bandwidth drain as well there are a lot more web based apps these days and that reduces the ability and performance of other employees using those applications
2465310 there is a productivity angle to this as well as a bandwidth consumption concern the way weve addressed it is by providing granular policy capabilities that enable people to watch some of it without being draconian and closing it out completely which we can also do
2465311 one is for olympic news but not streaming media and then the other is specific to those sites offering streaming media of the games themselves say the nbc site or any derivative site with media signature patterns
2465312 not just nbcs site but any derivative site with media signature patterns that show it links to the parent site its up to the customer whether or not to block it
2465313 were completely non invasive first off its very common for enterprises to have multiple layers of security at endpoints gateways and internet filtering for monitoring user behavior ours is a complementary security technology with a very high attach rate
2465314 because of our architecture its a pass by appliance device we arent in the direct line of fire trying to access a prohibited site results in a blocked page so we dont slow down network traffic at all or any other network appliances trying to do other security
2465315 enterprises tend to be less draconian they do more monitoring and see through reporting
2465316 enterprises will block adult content and any malware categories phishing botnet sites
2465317 we use a set of automated tools as well as human verifiers to assess and classify malware sites properly
2465318 weve done a lot of research with customers on social networking sites and enterprises tend to block social networking sites outright at least most enterprises do that may change going forward they may block it now but going forward may start to consider it as something they have to provide to employees but ration access typically arent blocked outright so the olympics coverage is a new wrinkle it may result in new policies being created as a result my guess is that they going to block it entirely or limit it and i think theyll opt for the latter one other option is that they may just issue a policy to employees letting them know theyre monitoring it thats very common in enterprises

2465599 the local car community is really tight the h a m b itself is really tight its an odd kind of a message board you go about it the wrong way youre going to get kicked in the ass but i think thats what drew me to it in that these guys they dont just talk the talk if youre going to play the game youve got to play the game right
2465600 we aint bad guys we look different we drive different cars were very different people andys a great kid
2465601 we had three special ladies that we dedicated this race to
2465602 and we pulled seven strokes each for them for 21 strokes and thats where the girls dug in and did it on emotion
2465603 ive got two 16 year olds in the boat rowing against all those senior girls with all kinds of experience it was fantastic
2465604 we beat h j oconnell out in harbour grace two weeks ago but it didnt work out today
2465605 it was a good year for the kids theyll be back again next year
2465606 they were so focused and controlled it was a pleasure to get in the boat with them each and every day
2465607 ive rowed on a couple of other championship crews and i dont know one year it was for the girls to go off on a win this year theres a lot of girls and gord and doug trainor this is their first championship crew so it was an awesome feeling to do it for them
2465608 the work that goes into it there are mornings when youre getting up at 5 a m and saying to yourself gosh what am i doing this for and then theres nights like this when it all pays off and everything is validated thats why you do it
2465609 in these kinds of races with everybody so close you have to look out for everybody and mistakes can happen anywhere
2465610 coming back keeping focused on your own boat not worrying about what other people do just sticking to the plan and having faith in your crew and knowing each person in the boat is going to pushing just as hard as you
2465611 this is my first championship and the competition is fierce but one thing ive tried to learn to do is to keep my focus in my boat listen to my coxswain and try not to look to the side because that can throw you of your game
2465612 both camps are very confident but there is one difference
2465613 that was probably the weirdest game i have been part of
2465614 we didnt play well enough to win with that many missed opportunities and turnovers you shouldnt win a game like that i am actually surprised it was that close
2465615 we didnt play smart at times on special teams offence or defence
2465616 i was leading the second game and maybe took a few too many risks i did not keep pushing into the four corners in the third game
2465617 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2465618 what would happen if microsoft or yahoo or a microhoo went to the 5 top results for the top 25k searches and paid them to leave the google index
2465619 what does a company get out of its employees spending half their day using an email program
2465620 and provides his perspective on using email as a tool
2465621 turn off the damn email software and get some work done or go for a walk
2465622 the increasingly personalized infoporn delivered to us through a broadening array of channels like rss alerts twitter digg email im social networks and more is a looming disaster
2465623 meetings about meetings emails about phone calls efficiency tools and methodologies that nobody can figure out its no wonder burnout is so prevalent
2465624 american workers waste 650 billion a year checking email too often
2465625 use this to implement really stupid rules and codes of conduct that will only reduce company moral e
2465626 the old school thinking is about individual productivity but the social revolution has moved past that into network productivity which entails connectedness and social meaning the personal hit on productivity is real but its not a cost its an investment and the juice is worth the squeeze
2465627 is todays knowledge worker unproductive or do knowledge workers operate differently
2465628 not just as an application but as a platform to facilitate the gathering organization and integration of data across disparate sources and applications and because they recognize that data are more useful and actionable when freed rather than trapped
2465629 i think many companies rolled out wikis for their customers and incorrectly assumed they were read more
2465630 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2465631 i dont think theres a u s city that could match this at this time
2465632 i am honored to represent my country and im so happy to be an american and live there
2465633 im so happy to be here at the 2008 olympic games
2465634 i hope that foreigners watching the olympics can see how much china has developed
2465635 this is an opportunity for the world to understand china and for us to see more of the world
2465636 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2465637 the more you allow yourself to be ping ponged around from im chat to email to what you should be working on to social network to phone call the less likely you are to ever hit a flow state
2465638 i am very pleased because gary sawyer has a lingering hamstring problem and he just cant seem to get rid of it
2465639 we have admired chris from afar in the past he has a wealth of experience after playing for several championship teams
2465640 he is more than 6ft tall with a long throw and has great experience
2465641 we are slowly getting a squad together and this is the type of player we are looking for
2465642 we expect the market to calm down over the next one to two years but after that the situation will probably become more strained again
2465643 only the opec nations are able to boost capacity in an meaningful way
2465644 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat

2465646 ty and i have a 6 day vacation and we are going with our good friends now that nashville star is wrapped up and the brad paisley tour is on a mini break i have a few days to get away and im ready
2465647 if were going to get serious about putting our nations fiscal house in order lets talk about putting an end to billions in no bid contract awards to unaccountable contractors
2465648 lets talk about the number of lucrative contracts and bonuses being paid for duties never performed promises never fulfilled and contracts falsely described as complete and lets talk about reforming the federal contracting system so that we can take on the real waste fraud and abuse in our federal government

2465756 i like some of the professed goals but im an anti institutional anarchist so you can imagine

2465759 mi rechazo a mico mandate se podria calificar de fundametalista pero eso no significa que apoye a la pandilla de mangantes que se llaman
2465760 strongly against chavez however aware that an awakwening towards how the lower classes were marginalized in the past was necessary chavez brought this awakening but not the solution therefore strongly against chavez however the opposition doesn t show signs of having a solution or even caring about making this change a reality it seems like they are still after their own self interests as usual
2465761 i love the country i can not side with this patetic oppo movement either
2465762 im not against the stated goals of chavez but think that he is failing to achieve them miserably i really believe his intentions are far from what he says they are which is part of why they fail also i am very sympathetic towards the majority of chavez supporters just not the ones in positions of influence
2465763 i think chavez is tapping into a reality of serious problems that existed under the ancien regime i do not believe the current opposition would do a good job of addressing those very serious issues it would be fantastic to see someone with both a real committment to democracy and also helping the poor
2465764 the designers have delivered a fantastic overall look and i am confident that team gb will make an impact

2465839 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2465840 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2465841 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2465842 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2465862 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2465863 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2465864 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2465865 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2465866 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2465867 i should have known that people would feel that way
2465868 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2465869 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear

2465878 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2465879 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers

2465886 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2465887 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2465888 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2465889 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2465890 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2465891 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career

2465893 einstein insisted on writing to her again so that you are completely clear about the situation he was prepared to live together again because i dont want to lose the children and i dont want them to lose me it was out of the question that he would have a friendly relationship with her but he would aim for a businesslike one the personal aspects much be reduced to a tiny remnant he said in return i assure you of proper comportment on my part such as i would exercise to any woman as a stranger

2465896 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2465897 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2465922 the market has been on a relentless upward march with very little respite for years culminating last calendar year in a rise of almost 20 per cent on the adelaide metro median price which is a phenomenal increase and those sorts of increases cannot be sustained
2465923 so the boom had to end and its come down with a small thud
2465924 what has caused the change in sentiment is a whole collection of factors which include rising interest rates credit squeezes the rising cost of basket groceries and fuel and transport prices
2465925 i think people have been slower to commit at the moment because of the uncertainty about where interest rates are going
2465926 theres been a little bit of people sitting on their hands
2465927 im strongly of the opinion now is the time to start looking again to buy
2465928 the smart people will actually make commitments now before interest rates start to ease back
2465929 i think people are taking a little bit of time to absorb it because they buyers dont quite understand it all yet
2465930 all they need to know especially from a buyers point of view is its all about consumer protection and transparency with all transactions

2465939 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2465940 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2465941 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2465951 and id still say that if she was a man
2465952 you assume that in order for everyone in your family to have the same name a woman should change her name to yours instead of you changing your name to hers

2465958 the crisis in tibet demands serious and urgent attention president sarkozy should not now retreat from what was promising french leadership on an issue of international concern at this time a meeting between sarkozy and the dalai lama is less important than an indication from the elysee palace of its serious intention to help move negotiations between the chinese and tibetans forward to a successful conclusion
2465959 the presence of president sarkozys wife carla bruni sarkozy at a ceremony with the dalai lama on 22 august and a meeting before the end of the year are a sign that in order to make progress on peace dialogue and mutual respect are better than provocation and violence
2465960 we now sincerely hope that in beijing tomorrow president sarkozy as the chairman of the european union will raise with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao the current crackdown in tibet and the need for china to engage in sincere and results oriented talks with the dalai lama and his representatives

2465969 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2465970 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2466001 it is baffling how a small mining company and without track record in the mining industry like geograce could get multi million mining deals with big foreign mining companies and how these mining companies of mike defensor were given hundreds of thousands of hectares of mineral lands by the arroyo government
2466002 it seems that the present government is selling the countrys patrimony to foreign companies but not without ensuring that local allies also get a huge share of the plunder
2466003 should we not see the other side of the picture thats a negative view that raises speculations na napaboran si mike defensor but these are private business investment ventures and whether its mike defensor who is the owner or jess duerza you should welcome it

2466010 there has been a great deal of work going on behind the scenes since macdermid printing blankets joined the trelleborg stable and ifra is the perfect platform for us to inform customers about our joint plans for the future
2466011 its a very exciting period because the synergies and strengths of the two companies enable us to provide a unique range of blanket solutions the newspaper sector is increasingly important for us and weve had a high take up of our metal blacked blankets in particular
2466012 right from the initial concept of the magazine we worked hard with our publisher center of service gmbh in hamburg to ensure that every aspect of victor by hasselblad the size print quality editorial content and obviously the photographic content ideally matched our objectives of setting a new standard in photographic publications and of showcasing the amazing photographs shot by hasselblad customers that the publication has now been awarded a bcp gold medal is a great endorsement of our decision to launch victor as a large format publication that reflects the quality of our camera systems and recognition of the fact that weve consistently maintained the same high standards we set ourselves in the first issue in september 2006
2466013 every conceivable aspect that constitutes excellence in a publication is clearly visible in the magazine victor the publication is a new media highlight which in the jurys opinion could rapidly develop into a collectors item by virtue of its opulence
2466014 we had two representatives in southern africa because of baldwin acquisitions going back many years and although both companies have done a good job the market is changing and ipex is perfectly suited to represent the full range of baldwins latest technologies
2466015 ipex has experience in serving all of the markets that we supply from sheet fed to commercial web and newspapers while its premises in johannesburg durban and cape town provide excellent coverage geographically
2466016 there will be benefits to customers in terms of having one point of contact and there are advantages to us such as having only one set of engineers to keep fully trained on new developments ipex has a strong background in engineering that enables it to provide comprehensive and competent technical support leading up to an installation during commissioning and afterwards ipex has recently won some major orders for baldwin equipment and we expect that there will be other important new business announcements in the coming months
2466017 were delighted at baldwins decision to appoint ipex as exclusive distributor for southern africa

2466021 we were handing out leaflets entitled why care about climate change

2466023 it was only a fun thing i was saying to people hello im a penguin and my ice cap has melted so ive ended up in telford can i give you a leaflet people were loving it
2466024 i was told we had to go to the managers office to speak to the manager
2466025 we were told we couldnt do it without a criminal records bureau check and a risk assessment
2466026 i showed them a leaflet and i said if you want to talk about risks lets talk about climate change
2466027 im not disputing the importance of safety of children but we were not there to put anybody at risk
2466028 we were simply dressed up as penguins handing out leaflets
2466029 they have to be crb checked and risk assessed under the child protection act there are a lot of children playing in the park at this time of year and we have a duty of care to them and our adult visitors

2466036 baldwins lithospray world dampening equipment provides first class quality and performance but like all spray dampening systems the nozzles tend to become blocked during use because of dirt ink fly and other debris
2466037 the spray pattern and consequent print quality was affected even if only one or two nozzles became blocked and there are 256 on our goss universal 50 this meant that we normally had to stop the press once or twice a day in order to unblock a nozzle
2466038 with the cost of newsprint about 50 per cent higher in saudi arabia than in mainland europe the degree of wastage we were encountering because of press restarts was significant the answer came in the form of baldwins constant c technology which has proved to be highly effective at keeping the nozzles on the spray dampening system clear retrofitting the system was very straightforward and it has been extremely reliable with virtually no maintenance required
2466039 the flexibility of the system meant that we were able to trial the equipment on one goss tower before installing it on the other units
2466040 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track

2466055 i mean is this going to be something we cant even interpret through polling we can talk about the bradley effect because of what happened to tom bradley when he ran for governor of california and won in the polls twice and lost the governorship twice on election day ive seen theories about this that unless the african american candidate is able to get the election number he needs he wont get it that day he has to get it in the polling and barack hasnt cracked about 45 percent
2466056 pollsters look for the bradley effect the idea that some white voters are reluctant to say they support a white candidate over a black candidate the phrase refers to californias 1982 gubernatorial election when the late tom bradley a black democratic mayor of los angeles led in exit polls against white republican george deukmejian mr bradley lost the election the conclusion some voters hid their true choice from pollsters
2466057 the effect on my clients on a day to day basis of the failure to prosecute is severe i am sure you will appreciate that my clients were severely damaged as children accordingly they are hurt scared and scarred
2466058 a failure to prosecute and convict would be the ultimate betrayal of them by the government it would be the ultimate rejection of them and of their rights as human beings

2466101 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2466102 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2466103 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2466104 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2466105 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement

2466107 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2466108 like mark murphy said boy if we all sat down a couple of months ago maybe this would have been different well no kidding if this team had an owner this never would have happened ive heard that from so many other executives and owners that if the green bay packers had an owner it would have been handled much differently im convinced of that
2466109 were at the point where were saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years theyll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2466110 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2466111 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2466112 when certain people drink it brings out more of a violent tendency often leading to problems
2466113 young men especially can become aggressive on alcohol and get involved in fights and assaults
2466114 the really common things that we see at the royal brisbane and womens hospital are head injuries where theyve fallen over and hit their heads and we see lots of people with broken hands after hitting people
2466115 it really is very frustrating from a medical perspective because it chews up our resources if people didnt drink we wouldnt see anywhere near as many patients as we do
2466116 its easy to get around and get the job done
2466117 when theres nobody in the park we can really get it cleaned up quickly
2466118 we have a great crew a great lieutenant to work with and a variety of activity
2466119 were able to expand our work area into the hall because we dont have people in there
2466120 at night working on a regular basis you know who belongs in the park where they are or should be and what theyre doing
2466121 there is a lot of activity still taking place throughout the grounds with deliveries service and clean up activities and the bakery
2466122 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2466123 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2466124 it would be just like a power cut of the electrical supply to the heart
2466125 you cant wrap them in cotton wool or never let them out yes theyve got a condition but thats not the life we want them to have rhiann tells everyone she has a special heart
2466126 with a terminal illness the family has time to prepare and are able to say their goodbyes but with long qt the person is either fit and healthy or suddenly dead

2466170 conti hat elektronik schaeffler nicht und wenn die gesch fte zusammenkommen dann verkaufen wir in zukunft die elektronik gleich mit der kupplung
2466171 bei conti ist der reifen auch nicht sicher aber warum sollte conti einen bereich mit einer umsatzrendite von mehr als 16 prozent verkaufen
2466172 doch private equity als wei en ritter das mache ich nicht mit
2466173 wegen der finanzmarktkrise ist es schwierig derzeit an kapital zu kommen

2466182 neben den einsparungen die sich mit automatisierten kunden servicesystemen erzielen lassen profitieren viele unternehmen vor allem von der 24 st ndigen erreichbarkeit aus kundensicht ist aber auch die geschwindigkeit mit der ihre frage beantwortet wird von vorteil
2466183 in deutschland werden automatisierte kundensysteme erst seit zehn jahren genutzt obwohl viele firmen wissen dass sich investitionen in diesen bereich auszahlen und sich die kosten in der regel schon in einem jahr amortisiert haben besteht insbesondere bei kleineren unternehmen noch ein nachholbedarf

2466186 you have to love a nation that celebrates its independence every july 4th not with a parade of guns tanks and soldiers who file by the white house in a show of strength and muscle but with family picnics where kids throw frisbees the potato salad gets iffy and the flies die from happiness
2466187 tonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy
2466188 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

2466192 it is true that i had a meeting with arsene wenger
2466193 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2466194 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2466195 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastien leto cannot get a work permit
2466196 ryan babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2466197 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder
2466198 maybe he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2466199 i will try to improve the team and the squad if i can
2466200 i am pleased because we have not lost again i will try to do my best to improve the squad
2466201 robinho is very angry because of the way reals directors are behaving
2466202 he calls me everyday to find out if someone has informed me something about his future and i am forced to tell him they are not answering the phone
2466203 i have been trying to talk to a madrid director for three days and they have disappeared
2466204 at real madrid he is not finding the love and support he needs scolari is giving him the love
2466205 robinho cant understand anything he has a project to be the best player in the world but at real he wont be able to because he is treated like a normal player
2466206 madrid wanted to sign ronaldo the second choice was rafael van der vaart the third is david villa robinho is the fourth
2466207 he is definitely going to stay with us the coach has said he wants him in our team
2466208 we do not see any possibility of him leaving real madrid we know chelsea are interested in signing him but hes one of the best players in our team and we need him for the new season

2466227 you had 10 to 15 years of marketing in which the companies controlled the journal publications controlled the speakers bureaus controlled the dinners controlled the patient advocacy groups all of which communicated these drugs were a breakthrough
2466228 from the outset defendants recognized the need to promote nonmedically accepted indications and nonmedically necessary uses as the key to blockbuster success for their respective antipsychotic drugs
2466229 astrazeneca strenuously denies the allegations in these lawsuits most of which have been brought by private personal injury lawyers and will defend itself in these lawsuits
2466230 fda and the courts have recognized that off label prescribing by doctors is not only lawful but may be essential to giving patients optimal medical care
2466231 the decision to treat a patient using a medicine outside the scope of the labeling is a medical judgment made by the physician
2466232 we can acknowledge that we are part of a multistate investigation of the drug
2466233 astrazeneca intends to litigate these cases on the merits and will defend the cases vigorously
2466234 a large part of the legal problems attributed to zyprexa if they exist are arguably due to the failure of the responsible federal agencies to prevent abuse
2466235 because of my particular experience with my illness it was absolutely a miracle drug and ive been on it ever since
2466236 ive never been this big and ive had four kids
2466237 that particular use of it i dont think was marketed heavily as an off label indication by the company
2466238 the guitar work in particular really stood out for me

2466262 this is amazing for them they are supposed to be in their english class this afternoon but for days they have been asking if they could come down here its wonderful
2466263 i get quite emotional about things like this ive just phoned my parents to tell them im watching this in trafalgar square to make them jealous its pretty amazing to be watching it here
2466264 we are here together today because we need the chinese government to talk about human rights the situation in tibet and media freedom
2466265 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight
2466266 theyre throwing everything theyve got at this event itll be very hard for us to compete with that

2466275 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tribunal constitucional
2466276 la respuesta que se est dando por parte de zapatero a la cuesti n de la consulta es desproporcionada unilateral y dif cilmente entendible
2466277 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2466278 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2466279 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2466280 si nos cierran esta v a inventaremos nuevas v as

2466286 in this age which believes that there is a shortcut to everything the greatest lesson to be learned is that the most difficult way is in the long run the easiest
2466287 i thought wed done enough by halftime to be able to push on to the victory but credit to mali they are a tall physical team and they kept coming back at us its the olympics and you dont expect it to be easy
2466288 she came in pretty cold too she hadnt been on court much but she sank them when we needed them

2466290 and it obviously helps playing with andy because hes playing some of the best tennis of his life

2466294 ive met him six or seven times he beat me the first time we met and this is the second defeat

2466324 people forget that we have voluntary control over our minds and bodies that we can control our thoughts and our physical well being with our minds

2466346 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2466347 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2466348 it is funny to me that the most difficult tickets to obtain for the olympics is the hurdles final with liu xiang and every game that we play
2466349 i mean liu has already won a gold medal in athens and he held the world record we dont have a shot at any kind of medal i hope people are not disappointed
2466350 in terms of techniques we are indeed not of the same weight level with the us team
2466351 but we wont give up the chance it isnt so easy to compete with a team composed of the best basketball players in the world the experience is a very precious treasure in life
2466352 so many good teams that we have to play it could be difficult for us to go forward
2466353 yi jianlian has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman

2466357 it wont be easy but it will be an honor and a precious memory one that will last a lifetime

2466362 we dont believe the oral statements by the ptcl management we need something in writing regarding the withdrawal of the unified pay scale
2466363 if we have a family law they will think about this but now there is no protection
2466364 if you dont leave your parents house you will be divorced
2466365 i dont agree with this we are human beings and we must talk face to face
2466366 if i cant stay i should talk to my partner and we should take a decision together not by sending a message
2466367 they need to speak to their wives and discuss the problems they must discuss the reasons these practices are very hard for the woman and the family
2466368 if no one stops this it will continue and break all the family
2466369 the judge will ask if he meant what he said in the text message and if he did they will count it as a divorce
2466370 but i think some sharia judges will say you cant write the divorce unless you cant speak but others say you can write it so it depends on the judge
2466371 but unfortunately people dont follow these things so they must get the consequences of their actions
2466372 most of divorces take place when the husband is angry but once he calms down they will hug and make up
2466373 so well get used to that and do our best

2466385 its about getting back to seizing the moment and realising that im doing something that i love right now im so close
2466386 something went off in my head and i went to hell with all of this pressure forget about it ive addressed issues that were weighing me down and i feel like the way i have when i started as a kid now its easy
2466387 unlike the professionals amateur boxing is very quick and fast the standard is really high and unless youre a bit more scientific about how you approach preparation youre going to be left behind

2466395 auguriamo al nuovo governo e al popolo il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di un cambiamento autentico
2466396 nessuno pu dubitare dellimportanza che tali aspettative di cambiamento siano realizzate eliminando dallattivit politica errori e pratiche negative cos come la presa di decisioni urgenti per cercare il bene comune sugli interessi personali familiari di gruppo e partiti
2466397 che sia la chiesa sia lo stato sono istituzioni indipendenti e autonome
2466398 lo fanno per promuovere linteresse di tutti gli uomini che vivono sul suolo della patria

2466443 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2466444 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that

2466467 poverty cannot be eradicated by the citing case of kalawati and dramatising her poverty
2466468 the propaganda of the congress yuvraj is far from truth and his claims that nuclear energy would solve the problem of electricity shortage were baseless
2466469 it was wrong to project congress leaders like mahatma gandhi jawaharlal nehru rajiv gandhi as well as rahul gandhi at par with them

2466513 i knew it was going to be a tough one against paischer we know each other well
2466514 ive met him six or seven times he beat me the first time we met and this is the second defeat
2466515 i was just trying to get myself into the game against him it was very hard to do anything because every time i pushed forward he fought back

2466522 judy thinks all options should be on the table including offshore drilling but she also believes that we ought to be having an honest discussion based on factual evidence not misleading the general public with the kind of misinformation that came from congressman wolf just a few days ago
2466523 its hardly a surprise to see these kinds of tired political tactics from people like john boehner roy blunt and rudy giuliani but it is disappointing to see something like this from congressman wolf i guess after 27 years in congress its difficult to break free from the same old washington games but the voters really do deserve better than that

2466533 i havent been brilliant all day and i didnt expect to be so far ahead
2466534 i got well ahead in the fight but i did feel my legs begin to tire a bit which might just reflect how ive felt all day
2466535 and then i made two major mistakes i felt comfortable in the first score to get turned and then to be countered from that comfortable position i was a bit disappointed
2466536 i dont think it is anything missing from my judo i know when im full speed and not feeling so drained im capable of doing anything
2466537 it is now an opportunity for us to set common direction or thrust and an occasion to gather educators and define our character as members of mindanao ceap
2466538 ceap should be more militant about the burning issues of the day
2466539 ceap mindanao summit was organized to discuss and identify common directions for mindanao ceap members there was concurrence that would enrich participation in the ceap national convention
2466540 the group also resolved that the summit should be a sustained effort that would strengthen and highlight catholic education and church in mindanao and provide innovation to ceap as an organization
2466541 with that and with our thrust in the guidance of the holy spirit we set forth to our task in the summit articulated by its theme ceap mindanao in search for identity and mission
2466542 we will forge the voice of catholic education in mindanao

2466548 i had a great time and for us it was good to get away and be in that environment
2466549 it was very hot and if you look at the world population of athletics they are training in hot conditions throughout the year
2466550 when we left london it was raining it was cold and we were able to train twice a day in very good conditions
2466551 we had very good facilities that was the main reason for going we were sleeping eating and training at the home base
2466552 i went to a lot of races i went to the collegiate matches and watched a lot of americans and competed myself
2466553 i went to penn relays to mt sacs long beach all the different meetings just to see what people were running early in the season
2466554 at the penn relays i saw some of the best girls in the world running 400m 800m for them it was just training not racing and that changed my mindset
2466555 they dont say we cant run a race here because were not ready they just get out and race
2466556 it was just good to see that competitive edge from people who are best in the world
2466557 in april to may these guys are going out to wipe you out

2466593 this happened in hospitals like the vale and irh where argyll and clyde and then greater glasgow were running down services
2466594 the vale of leven hospital has been under threat of closure for more than 10 years
2466595 uncertainties over the future of the hospital led to lack of investment in the upgrading and maintenance of the hospital
2466596 in addition the hospital site appeared to be given a lower priority than other sites in the implementation of policies surveillance systems and staff development
2466597 the facilities at the vale of leven hospital were inadequate for effective patient isolation and infection control and there were frequent patient transfers between wards
2466598 there are other hospitals run by nhs greater glasgow and clyde such as the inverclyde royal hospital which have been treated in the same way as the vale of leven
2466599 how can the patients in these hospitals have confidence that they are not being left at risk from hospital acquired infections
2466600 it is clear from the report that the way nhs argyll and clyde and then nhs greater glasgow and clyde ran the hospital down in preparation for eventual closure resulted in it failing to meet the standards of hygiene and infection control which patients could expect

2466615 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2466616 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2466617 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2466618 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2466628 im here to go over the details of her disappearance with you i want to make sure that we have all the finer points
2466629 yes i want you to repeat what you told the other officer
2466630 very well i was meeting my wife for lunch yesterday it was a late lunch because i had several meetings in town we planned to meet at dooleys on 23rd at two thirty i got there and waited a half hour before i got impatient and drove home i called her friend clarice and i called her mom neither one of them had seen her finally i called the police
2466631 that was awfully quick do you always jump to conclusions that quickly
2466632 kathina never goes out she hates silver city there are only three places she ever goes by herself here her friend clarices apartment and her mothers house when she wasnt at any of them i assumed she was missing if you knew kathina youd understand
2466633 does a guy need a reason to have lunch with his wife
2466634 i know who you are youre a failed punk with a fake badge and im going to see to it that you spend the night in a jail cell
2466635 and ill see to it that you dont get away with murdering your wife trent
2466636 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2466637 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2466638 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2466639 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2466640 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2466641 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2466642 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2466643 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2466644 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2466645 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2466646 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2466647 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2466648 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2466649 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2466650 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2466651 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2466652 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2466653 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2466654 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2466655 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2466656 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2466657 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2466658 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2466659 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2466660 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2466661 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2466662 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2466663 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2466664 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2466665 a short film about having an annoying roommate with a lot of synths
2466666 i went through two years where i couldnt run 30 minutes without having to use the bathroom
2466667 all my runs and all my workouts were geared around where can i stop and go to the bathroom
2466668 hes like you have a wheat allergy im like no i dont whatever i had been told so many different things and he was like no seriously
2466669 it would be very very difficult and i just dont see how its possible the demands at that level are so tremendous that if you compromise the system in any way you just cant do it cant keep up with it
2466670 i have definitely seen a big change in every aspect of her life
2466671 its been very nice unfortunately she has a little damage shell have osteoporosis shell have some damage for life from it but we caught it early enough that we can fix some of the damage of having celiac for 10 years without knowing it
2466672 shes been close but she was more ready this time
2466673 theres always that little piece that says everyone else wants to be there too the way she did it made it a little intense
2466674 their take on it is that they arent used to it
2466675 they dont want to be blamed for a poor performance at the olympics
2466676 the goal is to stay in the race as long as possible
2466677 if they make a move make a move and go with them
2466678 its about bringing people together and about trying to put a good slant on religion by getting people to increase their love and understanding of god
2466679 its a real family event and it crosses all cultural social and religious boundaries
2466680 its slowly building up year by year and helping us cross those boundaries as people come and help us out every year and some of them have stayed with us
2466681 theres not many festivals which you can go to where they give out free food at the end and last year we gave out about 800 plates so this year were hoping for 1 000
2466682 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2466683 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2466684 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2466685 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2466686 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2466687 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2466688 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2466689 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2466690 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2466691 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2466692 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2466693 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2466694 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2466695 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2466696 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2466697 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2466698 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2466699 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2466700 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2466701 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2466702 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2466703 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2466704 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2466705 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2466706 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2466707 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2466708 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2466709 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2466710 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2466711 there are still lots of young writers artists photographers who come here for the seclusion of the dunes
2466712 i imagine that if youre working on a book you dont want to hear things like the 80 harley davidsons we had going down the main street of provincetown i couldnt even hear the phone on my desk
2466713 i had a big wild turkey blocking my way in here the other day
2466714 i sat here waiting for him to move and he just stared at me finally i had to get out and shoo him away
2466715 but there were as many as 40 over the years noreasters winds have taken a lot of em down some burned down some just fell down
2466716 there was a cement company here in the 1940s and legend has it that the office of that company is still buried out here somewhere when they open the shacks at the beginning of the season
2466717 its not unusual to have to shovel the sand out of them
2466718 they control the renting of the shacks if you want to apply you have to buy an annual membership its about 50 then if your name is selected you can take the shack for a week or two weeks
2466719 sometimes when were driving along the trails therell be a broom handle with an envelope stuck on it inside the envelope itll have a grocery list and a cheque and well take it downtown and pick up the stuff
2466720 there are blueberry bushes bayberry lichens scrub oak rose hips the portuguese people in provincetown pick the berries and boil them for rose hip tea very very high in vitamin c
2466721 and there are whitetail deer red fox snakes hawks osprey lots of coyotes theyre going to have to do something about that situation pretty soon the coyotes are starting to come into town at night and take domestic pets
2466722 my nephew made 21 000 on six fish he caught here
2466723 tunas the smallest was 400 pounds the biggest was 900 pounds
2466724 that means there are some environmental people out here doing some type of study on the vegetation
2466725 the beach is closed when the piping plovers are nesting
2466726 its an endangered seabird and the minute the rangers spot one of the nests they close the whole beach to vehicles you can still walk on the beach but you cant drive on it
2466727 the way our relays are set up it looks like of the four morning preliminary swimmers only one or two of those guys are going to move in to the night swim in some cases only one youre going to have to be fast and everybody knows it
2466728 em vez de ficar parada enquanto ela est mamando por exemplo eu consigo fazer outras coisas como comer ou usar o computador
2466729 eu n o tinha escolha precisava voltar a trabalhar com 15 dias de nascida eu j fui a uma audi ncia com ela no sling foi muito tranq ilo porque ela ficava quietinha aconchegada s parei de levar para as audi ncias quando ela come ou a falar e a interagir
2466730 tem a ver com o instinto materno de querer aconchegar o filho perto de ficar confort vel durante a amamenta o
2466731 a falta de mobilidade enquanto amamenta uma das principais causas do desmame e o sling devolve essa liberdade muitas pacientes j aprendem a dar de mamar usando o sling

2466733 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players
2466734 de uefa kan een eventuele extra straf van de fifa overnemen
2466735 faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to
2466736 gaat het er niet om dat je van a naar b vliegt maar juist hoe je de reis ervaart
2466737 republicans will not rest until we have an honest up or down vote on the american energy act
2466738 as we speak the faith food pantry is providing food for hundreds of people who can no longer afford to feed their families
2466739 gas prices have more than doubled since my opponent took office less than four years ago melissa bean has voted repeatedly against increasing american production and creating american jobs she just cast the deciding vote to let congress take an undeserved five week vacation one which many americans cannot afford due to washingtons inaction the american people need proactive leadership in washington that will stand up for them
2466740 son ustedes los que hacen que la comuna surga los que est n preocupados por lo que pasa en su sector pero a la vez buscan todos los medios para solucionarlos san clemente no estaria prosperando si no fuera gracias a ustedes

2466744 my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
2466745 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive
2466746 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them
2466747 wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle not which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men
2466748 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron
2466749 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables
2466750 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
2466751 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him

2467079 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2467080 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2467081 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2467082 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2467083 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2467084 wir sind aber realisten und keine tr umer wir gehen das spiel konzentriert an und wollen gewinnen

2467087 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2467088 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2467089 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2467117 if you are aware of these changes that are going on in the solar system you can actually start to synchronize your resonance pattern you can focus your energy to it by intent that might sound very esoteric but i think there is some validity to this meaning that you allow the change to happen in your body so you can adapt to the changes that are occurring in our environment
2467118 i think this amount of information this amount of energy is going to change our dna structure very quickly and we have to be aware of that and allow that to happen and go into sympathetic resonance with that if we resist that theres a chance we are going to get extremely sick
2467119 everybody has their own mission everybody is here this time to do something very specific to assist in this change that were going through for me its to bring a unified view of the universe and bring a technology that will help us transition through these changes for you and many others it might be completely different in being supportive of each other but basically it is to go into your chakra center to find your mission to find what youre here to do theres something that youre here to do that going to help the world commit to it whatever is necessary to get it done because there is very little time left

2467130 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2467131 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2467132 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2467133 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes
2467134 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2467135 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2467136 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing

2467140 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2467141 i didnt expect to be number one it was just the luck of the draw

2467144 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2467145 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2467146 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2467147 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2467148 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2467149 thus the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia if it does not promptly change course

2467160 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness

2467165 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain

2467167 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2467168 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2467171 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2467172 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2467177 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2467178 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora

2467185 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2467186 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2467187 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2467188 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2467189 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2467190 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2467191 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2467192 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2467193 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2467194 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2467195 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2467196 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2467197 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2467198 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2467199 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2467200 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2467201 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2467202 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project

2467249 by 2010 we will be very close to series production and aim to start with limited numbers in the hundreds
2467250 our aim is to cover costs by 2010 by 2012 we would be producing around 10 000 units
2467251 the next phase in electric car production is equipping the smart micro cars with lithium ion batteries with smart two seaters and the mercedes a series coming onto the market the following year
2467252 berlin is very interested and paris and rome would also be possible
2467253 the continuation of arrests in the west bank is clearly showing that president mahmoud abbas is not interested in launching a comprehensive national dialogue to end the current crisis
2467254 poverty cannot be eradicated by the citing case of kalawati and dramatising her poverty
2467255 the propaganda of the congress yuvraj is far from truth and his claims that nuclear energy would solve the problem of electricity shortage were baseless
2467256 it was wrong to project congress leaders like mahatma gandhi jawaharlal nehru rajiv gandhi as well as rahul gandhi at par with them
2467257 the congress leaders were against dalits which forced both amebdkar and kanshi ram to float new parties
2467258 there is a need to work on the economic policy to eradicate poverty
2467259 playing the communal card at grave cost to nations unity and integrity
2467260 bjps rank opportunism and using hindutva like a tissue paper and throw it thereafter became apparent when the partys prime ministerial candidate l k advani tried to become secular by declaring pakistan founder mohammad ali jinnah as secular and making a mockery of the partys pet akhand bharat theory
2467261 calls the bluff of two political parties one of hindutva and antoher of
2467262 hamas movement must rule in gaza and the occupied west bank according to the results of the elections

2467264 the reconciliation is the mechanism of the dialogue but ramallah is not ready for reconciliation now
2467265 teenage girls are struggling to find a positive identity that s not completely defined by their sexuality positive role models can help them find the strength to resist being sexualized by men s needs
2467266 pupils shouldn t assume that we ve met every target in gender equality how then do you explain the way popular culture portrays women we need to find a place in the curriculum to look at violence against women and sexist bullying
2467267 girls may do better than boys in tests but it doesn t matter how they perform academically they still don t get paid as much in the workplace
2467268 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2467269 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2467270 we re at the point where we re saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years they ll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2467271 but we just couldn t deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2467272 it is embarrassing we ve sworn an oath to do certain things and we re not being given the resources to achieve that
2467273 it s deemed more acceptable than in the city because the valley s the alternative scene and always has been
2467274 when certain people drink it brings out more of a violent tendency often leading to problems
2467275 young men especially can become aggressive on alcohol and get involved in fights and assaults
2467276 the really common things that we see at the royal brisbane and women s hospital are head injuries where they ve fallen over and hit their heads and we see lots of people with broken hands after hitting people
2467277 it really is very frustrating from a medical perspective because it chews up our resources if people didn t drink we wouldn t see anywhere near as many patients as we do
2467278 however there were no violent clashes with the police or army at any place

2467283 political challenges are natural and just reflect the forward trend of our islamic system
2467284 we should therefore not be afraid of ballyhoos by the west and dangers the foreign ministry should act with both courage and wisdom
2467285 to carry out widescale attacks on physical and human targets

2467287 it is still raining heavily and we fear that the number of people killed will continue to grow

2467300 i personally think that the banners look hideous and distasteful when i tried to raise this matter up with someone a long time ago i remember being told off that those posters were being targeted at the heartlanders
2467301 to put banners like the one you sent me when there is no ge general election near in sight thats
2467302 it gets very confusing here cant tell the difference between country state government and ruling party
2467303 ik heb na de koers even in een hoekje zitten nadenken ik miste hier een goede thomas dekker was de conclusie op dit parkoers is hij onze beste eendagsrenner dekker is naar mijn mening meer eendagsrenner dan gesink
2467304 het was een slagveld met een geweldige finale ik ben tevreden ik denk dat ik het maximale resultaat heb behaald
2467305 dat was net teveel voor me ik kwam bergop tekort op de grote mannen maar over de hele wedstrijd gezien was het verschil klein 0 001 procent
2467306 tim maeyens heeft een heel doordachte reeks gevaren en die was eigenlijk minder moeilijk dan vooraf gedacht natuurlijk moet je doorroeien voor die eerste plaats maar gelukkig roeide zijn dichtste tegenstander niet helemaal door tot het laatste zodat tim toch iets minder energie heeft verbruikt de echte wedstrijden beginnen voor hem vanaf de kwartfinales
2467307 bart poelvoorde en christophe raes hebben een race naar vermogen gevaren op het laatste stuk kwamen ze nog mooi opzetten maar ze geraakten net niet voorbij de duitsers en toen kreeg bart fysiek een blackout nu moeten ze herkansen en daarmee hebben ze zichzelf natuurlijk geen dienst bewezen maar het is nu zo in de herkansing moeten ze bij de eerste drie zitten voor een plaats in de halve finale en als je de tijden bekijkt zit dat er wel dik in
2467308 eigenlijk had ik niet verwacht dat hij hier zoiets kon neerzetten als je ziet tegen wie hij hier allemaal nog moet opboksen dan kan je enkel maar bewondering hebben maxime monfort was vandaag simpelweg niet goed genoeg niet meer of niet minder maar hij is alleszins nog gemotiveerd voor de tijdrit van woensdag
2467309 de andere drie hebben zeker gedaan wat van hen verwacht werd
2467310 jurgen van den broeck en johan vansummeren hebben allebei gedaan wat ze moesten doen maar ook christophe brandt had veel verdienste vandaag hij heeft een heel pak werk opgeknapt spijtig dat hij op een bepaald moment krampen krijgt want hij zat eigenlijk nog goed

2467319 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2467320 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
2467321 how much does a hot ticket like this go for

2467331 if you like action and sci fi flicks the klipsch speakers will be hard to beat at their price point as an added bonus once you burn them in they come close to the delicacy ive heard with paradigm speakers for example so how do they stack up against the best competitive speakers in a word impressively in my opinion the klipsch reference series speaker system is one of the top contenders
2467332 we have stayed true to the klipsch design philosophy and achieved a more complete design by utilizing sophisticated materials and incorporating advanced electronics weve always had a performance edge but now with the reference series weve moved further ahead in offering incredible performance and value we have maintained our traditional up front close to the soundstage musical intimacy expanded the soundstage and added a holographic 3d image audiophiles need to pay attention to reference because their old ideas of klipsch are going to be shaken
2467333 advanced reference series driver and materials technologies include 90 x 60 tractrix horns titanium tweeter diaphragms copper colored anodized aluminum cones glass filled vented cast polymer woofer frames large magnets and high precision solid pole pieces air core inductors and film type capacitors bi wire crossover networks mdf enclosures with computer optimized bracing and low restriction ports tapered array center channel similar to the approach of the klipsch synergy series reference systems utilize advanced technologies in every speaker for a smoother response and more consistent coverage pattern for example each speaker is equipped with a tractrix horn contributing to the systems excellent imaging reference systems however take the approach considerably further by delivering the advanced technologies through new higher grade materials and electronics the resulting family of products reproduces extended tight bass and extremely clear mid range and high frequencies that go well beyond the limit of human hearing
2467334 deliver more content and better performance at price points that are as low as half the cost of competitive models

2467347 students will learn what its truly like to be a homeless vet to have mental health issues
2467348 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2467349 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2467350 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2467351 we strongly believe there is credible evidence to show that
2467352 we are very disappointed by this and find it incredibly ironic that the same government that put the rifle in his hand is now seeking to up the ante because of his alleged use of that rifle
2467353 weve got to remember that everybody in fallujah had a rifle good guys and bad guys and to single out sgt nazario for the alleged use of that rifle in the charged offense really paints the picture of what the government seeks to do here
2467354 he said she said but he or she is wrong and here is the correct way to think
2467355 the era of equal time for skeptics who argue that global warming is just a result of natural variation and not human intervention seems to be largely over except on talk radio cable and local television
2467356 a member that is neither present nor represented at the meeting becomes irrelevant for the quorum
2467357 from that we can make a proper assessment if further measures are required or if we need to look at other things

2467368 the ukrainian state which has in recent times been misguidedly arming the georgian army and in so doing directly encouraging the georgian leadership to engage in intervention and ethnic cleansing in south ossetia has no moral right to preach to others let alone to seek a role in regulating the conflict
2467369 it doesnt mean that if youre not rich that will prevent you from helping people they share what they have
2467370 they are not the most well off but they live well because of their hard work
2467371 i praise their generosity and warm heartedness in taking us in

2467577 im sure the conditions are tough but its in the power of our officiating team to take measures in case the situation nears an unacceptable level
2467578 i believe everythings under control the conditions are not the best for humidity and that but our players are very strong they go all round the world on their travels
2467579 i think honestly whats important is the health of the players
2467580 the position today is that the health of the player is not at risk at all but we have people that manage competitions all year round and we know in case there are unacceptable conditions we will take some decisions on time
2467581 it is very hot and very humid and the sun isnt even out yet so im sure it will probably only get worse from here
2467582 it is unpredictable and probably the hottest conditions we are going to play in all year

2467599 n o tem surpresa nenhuma um time bem armado bem treinado com jogadores experientes mas que come ou mal vamos ter muita dificuldade no morumbi aonde as equipes v m marcando forte
2467600 ser um jogo dif cil o goi s cresceu depois da chegada do t cnico h lio dos anjos os jogadores ganharam confian a e o time vem atuando bem fora de casa eles contam com atletas experientes em uma fase boa

2467608 eu cheguei a pedir para sair durante o jogo contra o ipatinga quarta feira mas o pico sentiu a perna foi obrigado a ser substitu do e eu tive que ag entar at o fim
2467609 com esses gols que eu estou fazendo aqui com certeza iriam cogitar meu nome para a sele o brasileira isso se estivesse em um clube grande mas como estou aqui em goi nia dois gols que eu fa o valem como um
2467610 os n meros n o mentem se estou fazendo 15 gols quase um por jogo pelo vila nova imagine se estivesse em um time grande mais qualificado ent o no ano que vem vou jogar a s rie a tomara que seja pelo vila nova mas pode ser tamb m pelo botafogo ou at o corinthians meu projeto encerrar a carreira na elite do futebol
2467611 eu n o digo que fiquei frustrado mas foi prematuro da minha parte sair do corinthians naquele momento eu n o aceitava a reserva e queria a camisa de titular se me dessem teria ficado mais tempo com certeza
2467612 pela dificuldade que tivemos no come o do campeonato est boa nossa coloca o no g 4 mas n o podemos comemorar nada e d para tirar essa diferen a de pontos
2467613 para ser campe o brasileiro precisamos ganhar de todo mundo pois est muito equilibrado muita coisa ainda pode mudar
2467614 uma situa o dif cil ter oito pontos de desvantagem nessa altura do campeonato mas podemos fazer os resultados para reverter isso
2467615 para esse turno n o temos mais chance de alcan ar o gr mio mas a equipe est com os p s no ch o sabendo que tem de melhorar bastante no segundo turno se quiser ser campe o

2467670 mr costello said a report by global investment bank goldman sachs which found the impact of the us mortgage crisis could be far greater than thought posed risks to australia
2467671 the report suggests investors may need to cut back lending by us2 trillion
2467672 they are saying that this could lead to a downturn in the worlds largest economy
2467673 this is a very very big risk out in the international economy at the moment
2467674 and believe me australia will not be immune it will take a lot of management to get us through this
2467675 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2467676 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them

2467723 it may only seem like a 1 50 a month or 3 a month but it will certainly add up to big revenue for bell and for telus and its really unfair for the consumer
2467724 all of a sudden the rules have changed and people are being told about on one months notice
2467725 everybodys finding it tougher to make ends meet at the end of the month and you add up all these charges this kind of gouging its not fair its not right and we wanna see legislation to put a stop to it

2467728 is a reflection of the extraordinary pressures at work in the housing and mortgage markets

2467730 groundhog day is coming lets put out a coupon for that the more shadow the higher the discount
2467731 people will search for information before they meet you and afterwards as well
2467732 it is like an online reference check its not the only thing that is important but it adds to their overall assessment of you
2467733 the internet plays an increasingly important role in our everyday life and recent research suggests we value it more highly than a trusted friend
2467734 now we go to the web first and turn to our friends second
2467735 in this day and age googling yourself isnt about ego surfing but about reputation management
2467736 are you happy with what you find is it accurate is it relevant
2467737 most people arent aware of privacy settings on social networking sites
2467738 pictures can speak a thousand words particularly when taken out of context
2467739 even though recruiters wont rely completely on what they find out about people online if they dont find out anything about you theres an increasing attitude that you cant be much of a contributor
2467740 i was speaking to the hr director of a division of one of the worlds leading brands who was taken aback in an interview when the candidate said that they were surprised that they could not find the hr director on linkedin
2467741 the situation was particularly embarrassing because the company positions itself at the leading edge of attracting and retaining employees
2467742 linkedin and ziggs are a great way to build a professional profile
2467743 theyre highly respected by search engines so will usually appear on the first page they dont take much effort to maintain unlike a blog where you have to constantly update it to keep it relevant
2467744 its a bit like being told by a friend that you should see a particular movie
2467745 if you were told the same information by someone you met in a pub you would not value it as much even though its the same information
2467746 before you create your entry think about what you want to become known for
2467747 you need to keep your profile consistent so people can identify and follow you through different sites
2467748 be aware that whatever you write will be found by someone
2467749 if you put anything in email or online then make sure you are happy to stand by it

2467776 i think a key issue is prairie chickens and habitat loss and disturbance and their may be certainly issues for water foul and birds in the playa lakes region
2467777 prairie chickens are sensitive to fragmentation they kind of need wide open spaces and any time you introduce infrastructures they leave an area and their breeding success declines quite a bit
2467778 it could effect the way people us their land and could prevent wind farms from being sited
2467779 were kind of finding our way along with the industry
2467780 what were hoping for is to increase predictability to enhance mitigation
2467781 it can cause islands if you will making the population vulnerable to catastrophes inbreeding and social dysfunction
2467782 the wind industry as a whole has been very proactive in contacting agencies

2467787 as far as green energy goes it is here it is going to be here and i think hopefully contribute to some of our energy needs
2467788 as a planner you obviously want organized development to happen and not intrude upon peoples lives this type of activity will i think down the road help everyone and not just certain segments of the population
2467789 the plan includes more than 70 turbines in tioga county many would be placed along this the armenian mountain range but the plan doesnt come without some stiff opposition
2467790 the problem in the northeast is they are trying to put them too close to residential areas
2467791 we simply have an ordinance that is in effect along with guidelines and when an applicant submits its application the commissions obligation is to review that to make sure it meets the requirements of the ordinance
2467792 as recently as july 21 malcolm wicks visited the national renewable energy centre in the north east and predicted that an expansion in offshore wind could create up to 30 000 new jobs in manufacturing and bring at least 3bn of investment
2467793 we think teesside offshore wind could be a green beacon and a flagship project for the region and that this is an opportunity for redcar to lead the way in helping the uk to meet its obligations to reduce carbon emissions just as it led the way in the industrial revolution with its steelworks
2467794 we are concerned that the court has taken insufficient notice of the impact on the sea views to be caused by 30 massive wind turbines less than a mile offshore from the town centre
2467795 it seems nobody will take up the invitation to visit our town to see for themselves what a huge impact these unsightly turbines will have i would have preferred it if the judge had done that
2467796 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation

2467816 we now advise against all non essential travel to georgia

2467819 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2467820 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2467821 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2467822 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2467823 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2467824 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2467825 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2467826 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2467827 tskhinvali is now under the complete control of our troops
2467828 today we have hit four russian fighter jets we have now hit 10 in total and captured a pilot
2467829 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2467830 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2467831 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2467832 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2467833 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2467834 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2467835 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2467836 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2467837 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2467838 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2467839 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2467840 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2467841 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2467842 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2467843 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali the provincial capital
2467844 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2467845 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2467846 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2467847 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2467848 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2467849 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2467850 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2467851 the white house and u s embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs u s officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2467852 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2467853 after the results were announced lord paul went and hugged the malaysian minister
2467854 i pointed out what needs to be done by this cpa the uk will support the new chairman to reach that aim
2467855 quid pro quo which i understand had been agreed upon three years ago
2467856 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2467857 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2467858 all sides must remember that attacks on civilians or acts intended to terrorise civilians clearly violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes
2467859 this would be true even if they are carried out in reprisal for indiscriminate attacks by the adversary
2467860 there is a real danger that the conflict will expand beyond south ossetia to abkhazia and other parts of georgia
2467861 all sides should immediately cease hostilities in south ossetia uphold humanitarian law protect the civilian population and resume talks to stop an expansion of the conflict

2467870 con la intenci n de poner en terreno concreto la convenci n para la salvaguardia del patrimonio cultural inmaterial
2467871 trabajamos con especialistas para definir los criterios las categor as que deben constituir al patrimonio inmaterial cuando tengamos una visi n global tendremos que generar las pol ticas p blicas que permitan esa salvaguardia y el reconocimiento especialmente con el patrimonio que est en riesgo
2467872 lo primero que buscamos es documentarlo registrarlo ver en qu consiste ese patrimonio ponerlo a la luz p blica para que se convierta en el primer momento de la valoraci n e identificar los casos en donde hay pr cticas culturales en riesgo de desaparecer por diferentes motivos
2467873 de repente tenemos pr cticas como la medicina tradicional que ya s lo la realizan personas mayores y no se dio la transmisi n generacional un problema fundamental de ah que debamos poner nuestro ojo como instituciones para incidir en que los due os del patrimonio cuenten con condiciones para transmitir su conocimiento de generaci n en generaci n

2467880 if a club offers you big money for a player there is always pressure on you to give it serious consideration especially after youve been knocked out of europe
2467881 were more susceptible to an offer but so far we havent had one and i hope that continues
2467882 we have no offer for carlos and that is where we stand right now we dont want one and are not seeking one and we dont need to sell the player or any player at this stage
2467883 everybody else at rangers hopes that continues to be the case

2467885 el ife no puede iniciar investigaciones de oficio por apariciones de pol ticos en noticiarios es una cosa muy delicada porque est la consideraci n que hacen los concesionarios de radio y televisi n de que ellos dan promoci n a quienes dan noticia sin embargo si se presentan quejas el ife har una investigaci n del caso
2467886 estamos haciendo la integraci n del expediente las investigaciones que corresponden y despu s de eso la comisi n encargada llevar un proyecto de resoluci n al consejo general para que ah se determine
2467887 theres a time where you are getting to know each other
2467888 we are trying to understand what the new manager wants and is trying to bring to the team
2467889 it will be an interesting season after the moves going on here
2467890 we need to prove we can continue without some players who were key last season
2467891 it will be three years on august 18 since we had the accident and it is ridiculous the compensation hasnt come through
2467892 i probably wouldnt be alive long enough to spend it but it can go to my sons and help them they lost their mother
2467893 it has really changed my life me and my wife used to go everywhere together but i have only got myself now i never go near the site of the accident if i want to go into town i go all through the back roads so i avoid it
2467894 dad gets very stressed about it all it would be nice if he got the money so he could go off on holiday or do something for himself
2467895 proceedings are about to be launched to assess the levels of compensation
2467896 i was so angry when he bainbridge went back to court to get his licence back as far as im concerned he shouldnt be out of prison ive always said it should be life for a life
2467897 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2467898 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2467899 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2467900 not even donald trump can say youre fired when you are returning from military service
2467901 our brave men and women serving our country already sacrifice time away from their families jobs and their lives
2467902 the least we can do is help ensure that when they return their jobs will be waiting for them
2467903 employment was brief non recurrent and with no reasonable expectation that it would continue indefinitely or for a significant period
2467904 i want them to pay for what they did this caused a downward spiral in my life almost forced me to bankruptcy
2467905 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2467906 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2467907 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2467908 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2467909 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2467910 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2467911 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2467912 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2467913 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2467914 the lack of faculty is the root of the nursing shortage the va is providing faculty
2467915 students will learn what its truly like to be a homeless vet to have mental health issues
2467916 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2467917 we strongly believe there is credible evidence to show that
2467918 we are very disappointed by this and find it incredibly ironic that the same government that put the rifle in his hand is now seeking to up the ante because of his alleged use of that rifle
2467919 weve got to remember that everybody in fallujah had a rifle good guys and bad guys and to single out sgt nazario for the alleged use of that rifle in the charged offense really paints the picture of what the government seeks to do here
2467920 put that putter away does that duckbill make me look fat

2467923 we care about the production because we own the wind turbines every time they turn around it means money in the bank and being part of it we also feel responsible
2467924 we dont try to predict the future thats really hard and not that productive what we try to do is understand the materials of the future because if you do you can help shape the future and thats way more important than trying to predict the future building a best case scenario that we can believe in and building the world we want to live in

2467931 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2467932 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2467933 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2467934 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2467935 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2467936 many students are bringing thousands of dollars of electronic equipment into their dorm rooms with little to no security precautions its just open season for criminals
2467937 jo se jo se jo se chants even though it was supposedly a mets road game
2467938 if i can keep driving in some runs and scoring some runs ill take that over a hitting streak
2467939 i need to get off to a better start than i did last year i wasnt too happy about my april in 2007
2467940 i want to drive balls into the gaps score runs and drive some runs in you can have the home runs let me drive in some runs and set up the guys behind me
2467941 our offense absolutely clicks when we keep the line moving
2467942 we dont necessarily get the big towering home run we take some pitches get on base
2467943 the braves are a much better ballclub than baltimore so to me its irrelevant really
2467944 well just reevaluate what we see and well make a decision from there ive told you guys from day 1 im not going to make decisions down here as far as stats things of that nature
2467945 here is a different sort of lefty starter a bit of yankee style big market thievery santana is a cy young winner transplanted in mid delivery at age 29 from one of those pathetic budget strapped franchises in the midwest
2467946 how many times do you get a guy this good in his prime at his best
2467947 you see everything with him for dwight it never quite happened that his physical and intellectual talents came together at the same time for dwight the excitement was watching a boy striking out men
2467948 with two outs and castillo on first beltran punched a soft liner to shallow center that a diving cody ross momentarily had in his glove before the ground knocked it out castillo did look back to check on the ball and third base coach sandy alomar
2467949 it would have been cool to see them go 1 2 for three or four turns of the rotation
2467950 but that hammy got pedro right away so well just have to make due
2467951 it was an adjustment just like when i put on the mets jersey for the first time it obviously wasnt as severe because i have a familiarity here with this ballpark and bobby cox and john smoltz and chipper jones but it still felt different i think in my mind i knew all right youre making a change and theres a little bit of uneasiness that comes with that obviously its a little bit easier to settle in because i do have history here and i have familiarity here
2467952 yeah i have it will be different pitching against those guys just like pitching against atlanta was always different than any other team i pitched against when i was with new york pitching against the mets is going to be the same way
2467953 its probably not as much simply because i spent 16 years here but i think its more than people give it credit for even though i was only there for five years i made some good friends there and those five years had a good impact on me as a person and on me as a player the emotional ties that i had there are much greater i think than people give it credit for because of that its going to be different but its not going to be like that first time i faced the braves after being here for 16 years and felt like everybody on the team and in the ballpark knew everything i was doing it wont be that extreme but itll be close
2467954 like ive said im not na ve enough to sit here and say everybody in atlanta is going to be thrilled that im back i know that there are some people that arent and will continue to not be those people that are set in their ways like that you cant change their minds but i think that the overwhelming majority of people will feel good and feel positive about me being back especially if i pitch well and help this team get back to the postseason
2467955 i dont know maybe maybe not i dont know why people needed to hear that from john or read it in a book because i made no bones about that fact that when i was facing free agency my goal was to stay in atlanta it just didnt work maybe his explanation in the book gives people different insight on it more so than oh hes just a greedy player and it was all about the money i still think there are people that feel that way but maybe there are people who were on the fence who are a little bit more understanding i dont know
2467956 i think so i think at the end of the day regardless of what happened between me and john i dont think it remained or continued to be a personal thing i think in the end me coming here obviously made sense for me personally and i think it makes sense for them business wise i dont see that that would have been too hard to overcome
2467957 i like our team i think offensively weve got a really good lineup we obviously have some questions with our pitching with john smoltz being a little bit banged up now obviously with mike hampton being hurt the last couple of years people are keeping their fingers crossed with him theres some uncertainty maybe a little bit in the bullpen but i think most teams are the same way most teams probably have their fingers crossed with one or two of their starting pitchers and have some uncertainty in the bullpen so i dont think were any different in that regard but i like our team weve got a nice mix of young superstars like brian mccann and jeff francoeur and some veteran guys like myself and chipper and mark teixeira and john its a good mix obviously everybody is talking about philly and new york and rightfully so the phillies are the defending champs and the mets added the best pitcher in baseball so they deserve the talk that theyre getting but i think our division is going to be extremely competitive and its going to come down to the same thing it seems to come down to for the last 130 years whoever stays healthy and pitches the best is going to win
2467958 no thats okay they can declare that and we can lay in the weeds thatll be fine
2467959 perhaps the easy thing to do would be say oh gee of course im devastated i guess thats not where im at in my life you know whether its maturity or being a dad or just everyday life where you see tragic things happen it bothered me more than any other game ive ever pitched look im pretty good about leaving things at the ballpark but i didnt leave that at the ballpark that got on the plane with me and went home with me and was with me for a good week after the season there arent too many games that i lose sleep over three or four nights later i might lose sleep that night but that bothered me it bothered me because of what it meant to that team it bothered me because of what it meant to me individually it bothered me knowing that was going to be the last image of the end of that season it was all of those things it couldnt have bothered me any more than it did its just that word the way i look at it you get a phone call that tells you hey your son is terminally ill thats a heck of a lot different feeling than im going to have over a baseball game thats just where i was trying to come from
2467960 it depends on what you judge success by obviously we didnt win a world series so from that standpoint it wasnt as successful as i would have liked its like so many things in life that you take on you want to leave something better than it was than when you got there and theres no question in my mind the mets organization is a better organization than when i got there was i a part of that absolutely how much of a part well people can argue that but it was a change of regime over there and they were doing a change in direction much like this organization here when they turned things around they started by bringing in guys who were winners who were good character guys to try to change the image of the organization i was a part of the start of that and then a lot of guys followed and made us a better team while i was there now theyre one of the premier organizations in baseball i view it a success in that regard its a much better organization than it was five years ago
2467961 isnt it fitting to go here first so it hits home a little bit more
2467962 i was always aware of why we got that monday off from school
2467963 ive heard and seen all these stories before its all very very fresh
2467964 we are happy about it but its been a long battle
2467965 little by little the layers of denial are peeling away
2467966 the city is no longer denying that a high percentage of people who spent a significant period of time there are sick
2467967 names of those of who died in performance of duty
2467968 each of these eight individuals assisted in rescue and recovery efforts it is only fitting that they be recognized in this fashion
2467969 had there been no attack these officers would be alive today
2467970 this is obviously very important to me and my children and bobs family
2467971 i want to see what its like see the legend and the myth
2467972 its the first time you see each other you see where you stand right away
2467973 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track

2467978 the status of the diplomatic process with the palestinians points to update the incoming prime minister
2467979 showed understanding of the sensitivity of the issue for israel and willingness to find a formulation that would balance these feelings with their national needs
2467980 he barak was very proud of the fact that his map would leave israel with about a third of the west bank territory
2467981 look this is a state to all its intents and purposes it looks like a state
2467982 it must be clear to everyone that the state of israel is a national homeland for the jewish people
2467983 the state of israel the nation of the jewish people and the palestinian state the nation of the palestinian people
2467984 the choice is between a jewish state on part of the land of israel and a binational state on all of the land of israel
2467985 israel and the clash of civilisations iraq iran and the plan to remake the middle east
2467986 statutul procesului diplomatic cu palestinienii puncte de urmat pentru viitorul premier
2467987 au manifestat n elegere pentru sensibilitatea israelului fa de aceasta problem i dorin a de a g si o formulare care s armonizeze aceste sentimente cu nevoile lor na ionale
2467988 el barak era foarte m ndru pentru c harta lui l sa israelului aproape o treime din teritoriul de vest
2467989 uita i v acesta este un stat pe m sura inten iilor si scopurilor sale
2467990 trebuie s fie clar pentru toata lumea c israelul ca stat este teritoriul na ional al poporului evreu
2467991 statul israelian na iunea poporului evreu i statul palestinian na iunea poporului palestinian
2467992 alegerea este ntre un stat evreu pe o parte a teritoriului israelian sau un stat bina ional pe tot teritoriul israelian

2468031 sport and sport watching is the moment not the end
2468032 we cant remember the last time a movie has created so much anticipation among female moviegoers from their 20s through their 40s
2468033 i dont know whether it would be possible for a real overachiever to figure out a way to get high off them
2468034 but in regular use its just not something thats going to happen
2468035 if you went to costco and bought 50 bags of sharpies and did something to them maybe theres a way to get creative and make it happen
2468036 principals make hundreds of decisions everyday based on our best judgment
2468037 weve purged every permanent marker there is in this building
2468038 okay i know you have got to be busy with running the entire universe and all but i think you had better give some thought to the weather down here things are going haywire hot and sunny one second freezing cold the next hey im on holidays pal
2468039 so so i think you had better get yer butt down here and fix a few things before i get angry
2468040 hello this is the operator i have a long distance call from acturus prime central commander pooflie will you accept the charges
2468041 er yes okay i will accept the charges thank you operator
2468042 earthling we are in orbit around your earth and are even now controlling your weather surrender to us or we will annihilate you
2468043 hello hello pitiful earthling are you there we apologize for the volume we have now since turned it down we are waiting patiently for your surrender
2468044 yeah i hear ya but i think youve got the wrong number maybe you should try the prime minister or someone like that
2468045 would you happen to have this prime minister persons number
2468046 um no not quite but you could try directory assistance at 411 they could probably help you out
2468047 umm hello earthling this is acturus prime central commander pooflie umm earthling i hate to bother you again but i seem to be unable to reach this prime minister person the being you call directory assistance was singularily unable to provide me with any assistance perhaps i could impose upon you yet again
2468048 you want to take over my planet and subjugate the billions of inhabitants turning them into your personal slaves
2468049 yes i guess thats true however we could make it um excuse me did you say billions
2468050 er yeah the population of the earth is something like 5 billion or so why
2468051 umm earthling we wish to offer our gravest apologies it appears that the late former first class planet examiner perfril made a slight error estimating the population of your planet his excuse was that he couldnt imagine a paltry little backwater marble of a planet harbouring that many semi intelligent inhabitants and thus arbitrarily took off a few zeros from his calculations well five zeros actually we umm well we are unprepared at this time to continue with the planned invasion of your earth please disregard the preceeding comments in fact disregard the entire conversation thank you for your aid good bye

2468146 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2468147 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2468148 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2468149 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2468150 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2468151 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2468152 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2468153 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2468161 a true muslim will never succumb to the temptation of passing unsubstantiated false judgments on another fellow brother even if it may mean the gain of the whole world it is the designated court whatever it may be that will pass judgment on the accused tun dr mahathir has failed to impress me that he is a true muslim as a non muslim i am truly ashamed of tun dr mahathir
2468162 it therefore defies belief that the government can still repeatedly declare that politics is not involved in the anwar sodomy case they are insulting the intelligence of the malaysians by such arrant nonsense the case is all about politics and nothing but politics if anwar were not a potential prime minister and only an ordinary citizen he would not face this prosecution it is as simple plain and obvious as that

2468172 so i turned off the tv in my mind and went to sleep
2468173 shes good but shes pretty close to the zone where things are happening

2468182 hotter than a european race but weve trained in this for the last week and we were more than prepared for what was to come
2468183 it wouldnt have been the smartest thing in the world to do my big flipping pass
2468184 we only have to beat one of those remaining teams anything can happen hopefully itll be good enough
2468185 we just didnt have it just that little extra bit to be in the gold medal race
2468186 we could see it right ahead of us but we couldnt get there
2468187 theres no way this is disappointing the olympics will never be disappointing
2468188 just getting here is so so hard i fought my whole life to be here in this road race
2468189 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2468190 i still cant believe ive just won the gold medal
2468191 i just did my best to stay hydrated and stay cool
2468192 i think we have to be satisfied we were aggressive we worked well together and we represented team usa just great
2468193 we got to the climb and it was lights out
2468194 as soon as you put your effort in in these conditions you cant recover
2468195 two of my biggest dreams my biggest goals in my career one of them was to play in the olympic games the other was to win an nba championship
2468196 these two weeks in china im trying to enjoy myself taking everything in have a great experience but also represent my country well and play some great basketball
2468197 its been great so far its even better then i was hoping walking into that stadium with 90 000 people it was an amazing feeling i enjoyed every minute of it
2468198 our group is as tough as it gets in a big tournament
2468199 the u s is probably the heavy favorite to win it all although we all know spain and greece are two of the best teams in europe over the last five six years so its going to be tough
2468200 when you go out there all you do is play hard and have fun and you see what happens after that
2468201 you know i just love to play ive always played in the summer if i wasnt playing for germany on the national team id probably be working out anyway playing pickup ball at home somewhere
2468202 my nature is just to always play and have fun with the sport because i love what i do
2468203 it wouldnt have been the smartest thing in the world to do my big flipping pass
2468204 we only have to beat one of those remaining teams anything can happen hopefully itll be good enough
2468205 im going to make it easy for you tell us what you love the most about puerto rico
2468206 were going through a moment of doubt and uncertainty and islanders should unite and show the world their true values
2468207 we dont skip training we were still training morning to evening we were training at the last minute and then we get it
2468208 im very happy because im here and i can compete with the team
2468209 our situation is very bad no good training ugly time no good situation
2468210 i dont think i can ever get over this man
2468211 it doesnt seem real ive been through making weight lots of times before and i always know what to do i dont know what it was that wasnt right im never going to understand it
2468212 all the guys at my weight need to watch out now because im coming for them
2468213 its even worse because i know i was going to win this tournament
2468214 i was right where i needed to be with the guys i had to fight i know them all the russian sergey vodopyanov and everybody i would have done anything to get that medal
2468215 one thing you have to remember is this extreme heat
2468216 theyve done a lot of work in the heat even in the morning and i really believe heat played a part in russells dehydration
2468217 the russian track and field federation has made the decision that this athlete will not start in beijing
2468218 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
2468219 the dna analyses are 100 percent so if the urine does not belong to the athlete then they certainly have a case to answer its a sad story
2468220 when were on the competition ground the best thing to do is just to live up to our own standards we cant pay attention to judging issues
2468221 we knew to compete with china we cannot make any mistakes and today we made a few
2468222 if we didnt make mistakes and lose then thats bad but we made some mistakes and we have to make sure we dont repeat them in final
2468223 we dont skip training we were still training morning to evening we were training at the last minute and then we get it
2468224 im very happy because im here and i can compete with the team
2468225 our situation is very bad no good training ugly time no good situation

2468229 a lot of it is learning what your land will do its an art as well as a trade
2468230 the best way to learn to farm is to apprentice yourself to the farmer then little by little go more on your own
2468231 be willing to put in the hours and the mindful work that it takes
2468232 be assured that you can be cured of your difficulty many have been both male and female and you can be also if you determine that it must be so

2468235 it is funny to me that the most difficult tickets to obtain for the olympics is the hurdles final with liu xiang and every game that we play
2468236 i mean liu has already won a gold medal in athens and he held the world record we dont have a shot at any kind of medal i hope people are not disappointed
2468237 in terms of techniques we are indeed not of the same weight level with the us team
2468238 but we wont give up the chance it isnt so easy to compete with a team composed of the best basketball players in the world the experience is a very precious treasure in life
2468239 so many good teams that we have to play it could be difficult for us to go forward
2468240 yi jianlian has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman
2468241 i dont think they are able to pose any real threat at the games
2468242 there wont be many opportunities to play an american all star team
2468243 i have been waiting for this moment for such a long time
2468244 it wont be easy but it will be an honor and a precious memory one that will last a lifetime
2468245 it was amazing i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2468246 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2468247 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
2468248 how much does a hot ticket like this go for
2468249 i was told when i picked them up last night that i could have sold them on the street for us 15 000
2468250 for a supposed multicultural world or at least its being pushed on western countries aka white countries there certainly wasnt a lot of multicultural people at these opening ceremonies a lot of black hair

2468278 i still cant believe ive just won the gold medal its something that is out of the world my fear was whether we could control the race as a team there were only five of us on the team we were all at the front working as a unit sastre was our captain and was keeping us calm i was saving my legs for the final lap its like a victory for all of us
2468279 i think i did something special i was good today and it wasnt my focus i tole myself i need to follow people today i took a risk
2468280 i had good legs today and had to ride conservatively
2468281 i knew that if i attacked and used too much energy i could lose everything on a course as hard as this with the heat so bad you have to ride conservatively
2468282 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2468283 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2468284 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2468285 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2468286 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2468287 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2468288 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2468289 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2468290 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2468291 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia

2468298 first we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach nearly half a trillion dollars next year eight years after we had a record surplus were now faced with record deficits this mortgaging of our childrens future is a direct result of the bush administrations dangerously failed fiscal policies
2468299 the second thing we learned this week was that the iraqi government now has a 79 billion budget surplus thanks to their windfall oil profits
2468300 and while this iraqi money sits in american banks american taxpayers continue to spend 10 billion a month to defend and rebuild iraq
2468301 thats right america faces a huge budget deficit iraq has a surplus now senator mccain promises to continue president bushs open ended commitment to the war in iraq while refusing to pressure iraqis to take responsibility for their own country
2468302 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back i believe that we need to move in a new direction
2468303 as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2468304 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2468305 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it
2468306 first there was his call for americans to check their tires which is commonsense advice but hardly has the makings of a national energy strategy if we cant drill our way out of the problem it seems even more unlikely that we can inflate our way out of it
2468307 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
2468308 ftd florists have celebrated ftd good neighbor day since 1994 encouraging all neighbors to help create a friendlier more caring and compassionate world through the gift of flowers thats why customers are encouraged to keep one flower for themselves and give the others away brightening the day of many other people

2468323 im so sorry jordan ive got some terrible news grandma died
2468324 it all happened within just a few hours of jordan arriving at the house so it wasnt because he started to lose it and wanted off the show
2468325 jordan was far too emotionally shaken up with the news of her death to continue and it was impossible for the continuous filming to be halted for him to return and resume two weeks later
2468326 o tempo era mais ou menos esse por volta de 4min10s 4min11s esperava que os tempos dos outros competidores fossem mais altos mas muita gente nadou bem o importante que estarei na final e amanh domingo outro dia

2468342 sharon stone and michael douglas were together in what movie

2468346 thank goodness i ducked because the cymbals could have decapitated me like oddjobs bowler hat in the bond movie vanilla ice really broke the set to pieces
2468347 nobodys ever quite seen tv like that where crew and a producer had to restrain him now thats reality
2468348 i am pleased to report that since the filming rob calmed down and finally made some peace with ron who convinced him that hed really been trying to sacrifice himself so rob would go on to win
2468349 ron just couldnt explain it properly under the heat of the lights and the moment and thus robs explosion
2468350 stick it in google robin had a list of 10 figures ranging from 400 000 to 21million and each number represented the 10 fame game casts number of search results in google ron and pepa had to match the celeb to the number

2468353 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2468354 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2468355 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8million euros
2468356 i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5 million euros a year rennes could never offer me that much
2468357 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2468358 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2468359 i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it

2468379 there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one
2468380 simple animals and plants existed on earth far before complex ones
2468381 if all living creatures must have a living parent if living creatures are different and if simpler forms were around before complex forms then the more complex forms must have come from the simpler forms
2468382 on the day the lord gave the amorites over to israel joshua said to the lord in the presence of israel o sun stand still over gibeon o moon over the valley of aijolon so the sun stood still and the moon stopped till the nation avenged itself on its enemies the sun stopped in the middle of sky and delayed going down about a full day

2468393 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2468394 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2468395 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2468396 we are a bit bruised and battered but we are alive and thats the main thing
2468397 we feel so blessed and so lucky that we werent a few carriages up
2468398 we had been where the carriages had crashed but the ticket collector was coming along so we got back into our seats and thats really what saved us
2468399 there was luggage and people rolling everywhere we just held on tight not knowing what to do the seats took the impact of the crash for us

2468413 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2468414 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

2468419 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2468506 it was wasnt it better than i thought it would be
2468507 yeah im glad you decided to have it here at your house you have more space than christine besides i prefer it here i like it here
2468508 now something i wanted to talk to you about now that theyre gone
2468509 when we were doing the meditation part did you feel horny
2468510 are you alright mona you arent sick are you let me get you a cool clothe dont faint on me
2468511 thats been happening a lot lately its geoffrey thats all
2468512 geoffrey oh i see you got it bad honey if you can feel him congratulation
2468513 i told him we have to wait i dont know if i can though i feel like im fit to explode i cant sleep ive lost my appetite and all i think about is making love to him its driving me bananas
2468514 its not funny and hes worst than i am i can feel him caressing me all the time his spirit even sleeps in my bed i dont know if i can hold him off much longer and i know i dont want to thank god david has taken to sleeping in the spare room i dont think i could handle sleeping with both of them
2468515 really well thats great news why did he do that i suppose geoffrey booted him out
2468516 i guess so at first i didnt know how i felt about it but now i tell you i am very grateful to say the least
2468517 its all happening so fast i can barely keep up
2468518 i mean i loved david in a way and we were fine i cant say i was all that happy with him but with geoffrey i feel elated alive i love being with him just to be with him makes me happy and when im not with him i miss him not so much in a sexual sense but in a friendship sort of way too you know just to talk and just to be together i never felt that way with david
2468519 well thats because with david you didnt have the 3 ls you have found with geoffrey
2468520 my dear the 3 ls is the secret ingredient to a successful long lasting relationship in my opinion if you dont have it with someone dont bother to marry them and i say this because there you two will be together with doors wide open to empty rooms in you waiting to be filled and in most cases in fear that any day now somebody else will come along and waltz right on in and fill them in my opinion this is the main reasons why people have affairs and dont stay together their desires commands fulfilment
2468521 ok but what is it do you think geoffrey and i have it
2468522 of course im sure you do the goddess of love would have it no other way
2468523 but ill tell you what it is and you judge for yourself
2468524 yes firstly is like which is extremely important you must like the person your with liking is a form of wanting in itself that is to say you must want to be with them and really enjoy being in their company like you do with a close friend you enjoy the time you spend together no matter what youre doing when youre with this person you feel happy and you are not thinking that you would prefer to be some place else let alone with someone else romantically or in similar circumstances thats how it is when you genuinely like a partner to be around them is its exciting fun comforting harmonious and evolutionary you feel the time spent with them was well worth it their presence gives you a lift and you find there is always something to discover to inspire your mind to expand a little the persons mind inside the body and the roles we play by the way feeling that way is what makes good friendships too of course friendships are a meeting of the minds the same mental wavelength where two create together on common ground which feeds affectionate wanting of attachments this is what it really means to like someone
2468525 ok i feel that way about him and he have said things like that to me so ill say he feels the same
2468526 good now lusting this is also a very important facture one in my opinion grossly neglected and highly misunderstood if you and your partner dont lust after each other you are going to have problems this is where the teachings of the goddess comes into vital play it was understood then were as now weve been taught that its a bad thing or we just take it to hell all together to lust after someone in itself isnt a form of perversion sexual desire is a healthy energy and a necessary one it is creative energy and it allows this creativity to express itself through our forms or bodies what it is expressing is the source of all loving things longing to merge in oneness with another physically but the distortion of this energy comes from the individuals mind and its beliefs about the act of having sex which in it self by the way is a gratification of a need of intimate physical closeness sex is a physical act which can be practice to gain fulfilment of a need or it can be a souls desire to bond to merge to create to manifest and give to another of ones self indeed it is the sharing of the self therefore it also imparts the act of respect reverence and cooperation lusting means simply to have a potent sexual or sensual desire towards someone you are attracted too and that desire makes you want more when you meet someone you know if you like them or not and it is the same when you meet someone you know if you lust for them or not the pull is felt in your body you gravitate towards them like a moth to a flame and all you want to do is all you can do to merge and feel the pleasure of loves physical expression in bed or any other convenient place
2468527 and believe me when i say that if you dont have that feeling that desire naturally no books dvds eastern practices or sexy attire will help it may assist in you getting some sex which i have no complaints about but the real hunger for the more or depth of satisfaction wont be felt
2468528 its important that you both feel that way about each other too because if you dont one will be frustrated and the other will be annoyed from unwanted attention so
2468529 yeah your right i feel david and i never felt that way about each other he desired me well he wanted sex but i never truly was turned on by him and forget about lusting and im not sure he lusted after me either i mean of course we had sex a lot in the beginning and it was ok but the hunger wasnt there no true feeling of satisfaction i actually thought that i was frigid
2468530 we tried to improve our sex life but in the end it became to much work so we eventually didnt bother mostly
2468531 and thats the way it should be a progressive hunger to want more
2468532 and isnt it great to feel that way about someone without all the freaking work
2468533 an geoffrey doesnt mind what i look like or have on either he still wants me i dont even think he notices and yet he notices everything like he can really see me the real me david always made note of my hair clothes and under garments superficial stuff he is really big into stuff like that especially when we had sex but he never really was into me i always felt i could have been any woman any woman at all
2468534 well i suppose if the lust isnt there naturally it needs help but well whatever
2468535 hmm and we do love each other geoffrey and i
2468536 in your opinion eva how do you know if you truly love someone
2468537 well apart from that feeling that inner knowingness i think you know that you truly love someone when you want to care for them to make sure that they have all they need to be healthy and happy your happiness isnt complete without them being happy as well so you give and do whatever it takes to make sure that happens you empathize with them and you cater to them in a very personal way it would seem as if they dont stand you dont stand if they are not in harmony youre not in harmony in other words they would have a profound affect on your state of beingness which would make sense because of the amalgamation you two in spiritual awareness have recognised that you are one in essence and purpose so in a very real way i guess catering to them and their wholeness is to also be catering to your own as well now sometimes we may have to go on loving them even after they have departed from us or if the relationship has ended for whatever reason there may be but this is done without malice or ill feeling towards them but the desire to want more of what you shared will always linger
2468538 it is important that you are grateful for the times that you shared together no matter what the circumstance were they will always occupy your heart as the years roll by because in truth you shall not be living with out them they are a part of you the moment you accepted them into that inner chamber so be peaceful about it and welcome the memories as a gift its then i feel you have truly loved someone but if the love youve had ceased to be for any reason then it isnt a true love you feel or shall i say a complete one anyway
2468539 that kind of love satisfies a momentary need i guess it helps us to prepare for the real thing it keep us fertile until true loves seedling start to grow so therefore it to is very important but as i said true love is always a part of you it is your desire to love a particular other and that desire can never reach an end because the nature of desire is to expand and to want more so even if you love another afterwards you will always love the first no person can be replaced who is truly lovingly desired but those who are only needed can be exchanged for another who has the means of fulfilment of that need needs have its limitations where as desires are infinite a love that is felt and ceases to be is in fact a combination of like and lust between two people that shared the same needs but with out desire for each other in regards to true loves relationships true love is strictly a spiritual desire of oneness with another its a yielding to the fact that you are not an individual but that you are a compound of another you have recognized yourself in another and it will always be that way no matter what life brings the effects of it will ripple through time but of course that doesnt mean one will never love someone else it just means that a person will always have connections to anyone that they truly loved
2468540 thats the nature of loving everything and everyone that we recognized our reflection and loved in our romantic relationships we seek this as well as oneness with the person mentally emotionally and physically as we are in truth spiritually equally matched in our desires for each other and means of fulfilment for our needs it is the ultimate quest
2468541 you know eva i really love geoffrey i have loved him all my life so it feels he is my soul mate and he is so kind and thoughtful handsome and ah so intensely sexy its really incredible i mean through all of this not once has he complained or tried to pressure me to do anything that im not ready for and i know he wants so much for us to be together lie together but he told me he was willing to wait for as long as it took hell wait he said the most important thing was that we be together and work it out together i never thought ill ever meet a man who loved me that much and yet i feel i have always known him

2468553 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2468554 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage

2468586 in an emergency situation persons with disability are often overlooked and may have specialized needs
2468587 therefore it becomes particularly important for cbm to work in tandem with other organizations to identify persons with disabilities in order to understand their situation and their needs
2468588 from my past experience of emergency situations i anticipate the post cyclone devastation will threaten the lives of people with disability because of their inability to access basic necessities such as water food shelter and healthcare
2468589 the most puzzling thing thats happened so far is their governments refusal yesterday to allow united nations aide workers to distribute the relief supplies

2468677 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2468678 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot

2468760 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2468761 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2468762 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2468763 im sitting at my desk in my car at home and i keep thinking about you
2468764 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2468765 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2468766 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2468770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2468771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2468786 hey my name is harry norman your wife tells me your adopting
2468787 im just not real upset about it im just going to move on ive already done that
2468788 last year i helped the team with some pretty big starts at the end of the year
2468789 id love to do that this year and i feel like i can still do that i feel like i have better things to come i was called up here for a reason
2468790 i was bit worried about the 1200 metres first up but he fought it out well
2468791 we prepared him for it with a barrier trial and a couple of jumpouts but i would have been happier if it had been 1000 metres or 1100 metres
2468792 his newmarket run was very strong so it was terrific to get the ride on him today
2468793 stavka was the in form horse and was always going to be hard to beat but i let him get a little bit on me before i asked my mount for a full effort
2468794 it is always important down the straight not to be doing your best at the 200 metres to save something late and he had enough left
2468795 i thought we had this won but it wasnt to be
2468796 i am trying to get a jockey to stay with him so hopefully he will stick
2468797 i liked the way he hit the line under his 58 kilos
2468798 it was a different tempo today compared to his previous run and i took a sit in behind the leader
2468799 hes a nice horse and i cant see why alan wouldnt send him down for the golden rose
2468800 i paid up with him for the golden rose because glen thinks hes good enough to have a go in it
2468801 after winning this hes probably earned enough prizemoney already so he wont need to have another run if he goes
2468802 i trained his mother fairbit who won three races including one in melbourne
2468803 ive got another foal out of her and theyre both only small
2468804 he wont be going to melbourne now you cant miss the start like he did and expect to win
2468805 missing the start didnt help and perhaps ric would have been better letting the horse drop back instead of taking him to the front
2468806 he was a bit fresh and its a credit to my staff that they did such a good job to settle him down
2468807 ive won a group three race at flemington but i would dearly love to win the wyong cup
2468808 i always take two or three hundred clients to the wyong meeting so its a big day for me

2468842 they are saying to the world we are more powerful than anyone it is an affront and cause for fear in taiwan
2468843 the opening ceremony was a display of chinas achievements and its culture and civilization after the olympics china might be more arrogant or more modest taiwan has little choice but to wait for chinas goodwill
2468844 china compromised to avoid taiwan teams boycotting the games and creating an international incident but it is unlikely that china will be lenient to taiwan on the issue of taiwans seeking international space
2468845 beijing olympics will boost chinas self confidence and expand its global influence will china be more flexible and loosen its grasp on key issues with taiwan there arent such signs yet
2468846 but we hope a more self confident china is more willing to seek understanding and reconciliation with taiwan
2468847 by asking for diplomatic truce and freezing arms purchases from the us taiwan has surrendered to china even before the battle began this strategy leans too much towards china and relies too much on chinas goodwill it endangers taiwans security and causes our allies to lose trust in taiwan

2468851 the beijing police are either so incompetent that they would let her disappear under their noses or that they must be responsible for taking her away
2468852 how can a young woman with an infant child sabotage the olympics while under such heavy and round the clock police presence
2468853 i think that maybe she has been taken away by police and forced to leave beijing but it is not clear what the situation is
2468854 from what i understand they the authorities will not let her stay in beijing during the olympic games
2468855 normally there is no big danger to dissidents taken into custody like this but she is only 24 years old and has a child so she will be under a lot of pressure especially with the olympic games

2468877 ohne die tatsachen zu kennen oder sich bei den zust ndigen stellen informiert zu haben greifen die oppositionsparteien einen zeitungsbericht auf um wieder einmal ihr beliebtes wien bashing betreiben zu k nnen
2468878 statt sich sachlich mit dem thema auseinanderzusetzen und sich zu informieren versuchen die oppositionsparteien politisches kleingeld zu schlagen dieses verantwortungslose verhalten ist auf das sch rfste zur ckzuweisen

2468882 democrats work for solutions republicans pray the problem will go away
2468883 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2468884 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months

2468900 colocado la camiseta del psoe y en vez de defender los intereses de los andaluces haya decidido entregar un cheque en blanco al vicepresidente econ mico pedro solbes
2468901 definida por todos los presidentes auton micos del partido que a finales del mes de julio en san mill n de la cogolla firmamos una propuesta
2468902 mientras el pp ha unificado criterios en materia de financiaci n auton mica siendo conscientes de que cada comunidad tiene unos intereses en el psoe esta unificaci n de criterios resulta imposible pues estamos pagando las consecuencia del comportamientos de l deres como chaves que ha alimentado la radicalidad en catalu a
2468903 mayor responsable de haber impulsado la posici n de catalu a se llama manuel chaves
2468904 hoy recogemos los frutos de un presidente que ha estado alimentando y meciendo la cuna de la insolidaridad y la desigualdad
2468905 mala para andaluc a pues el gobierno se siente atado por el estatuto de catalu a y al final se est demostrando que iba a ser un handicap para el acuerdo ya que significa una apuesta por la desigualdad y por la bilateralidad que es perjudicial para andaluc a
2468906 sin conocer los instrumentos de solidaridad y sin tener la cuant a definitiva del sistema ni los porcentajes en los criterios de distribuci n en cuanto a los par metros haya dado un cheque en blanco a solbes
2468907 defendemos el fondo de suficiencia y la poblaci n como el gran par metro a tener presente para el sistema de financiaci n asimismo apostamos por el incremento sustancial del fondo de compensaci n interterritorial
2468908 el problema es que hoy no basta s lo con defender el estatuto andaluz a la hora de definir el sistema de financiaci n sino que hay que defender del estatut catal n que son incompatible pues uno apuesta por la solidaridad y otro por la bilateralidad
2468909 que ha alimentado la radicalidad de catalu a que no es otro que chaves que tiene que apostar por el estatuto de andaluc a o el de catalu a
2468910 det var vildt sjovt drengene ville lade ronaldo vide at der ikke var nogen problemer efter snakken om et skifte
2468911 de fik lavet tr jen tidligere p ugen og gl dede sig rigtig meget til at give den til ham n r han vendte tilbage og han tog imod den med h jt hum r
2468912 ronaldo er et stort hit i omkl dningsrummet og drengene er glade for at have ham tilbage
2468913 det finns ingen plats f r tintin i ett demokratiskt samh lle
2468914 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising
2468915 the water and walls of mud came at night when everybody was sleeping
2468916 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2468917 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2468918 we had a mantra today and it lit us on fire
2468919 we didnt hold back for one moment we competed like it was our last day
2468920 there have to be services at the back end for the front end common service centres to deliver
2468921 modern corporate mythology has the unique decision maker as hero we adhere to the view that the many are smarter than the few and solicit a broad base of views before reaching any decision
2468922 building a consensus sometimes takes longer but always produces a more committed team and better decisions
2468923 fear of rejection is a natural reaction of people who meet for the first time it can lead to some apparently irrational behaviours triggered by primal defence mechanisms
2468924 simple activities such as walking in the forest or in the countryside are just as good at this early stage singing exercises theatre acting or drum playing exercises have also proved to be very effective with teams
2468925 they are meant to allow the team members to focus safely on the work at hand and to avoid energy wasting frustrations team norms set the boundaries for what is expected behaviour and what is unacceptable behaviour
2468926 authorisation which occurs after authentication or login is the last major mechanism that protects sensitive resources from access by underprivileged users
2468927 guessing a weak password is bad enough but things get a lot worse when we discover that the lowly user account we just compromised can mount a share containing sensitive corporate financial data
2468928 some of the most damaging attacks we have seen and heard of do not involve technology at all
2468929 so called social engineering uses human to human trickery and misdirection to gain unauthorised access to data
2468930 how could that be possible in an age in which were all so dependent on electronic transmissions to communicate quickly effectively and accurately with our co workers banning email is almost like prohibiting the use of calculators in favour of fingers and toes
2468931 what can be worse than absent signal for your cell phone
2468932 far worse is to have no missed calls at the end of a long meeting
2468933 sites like rivals com were revolutionary because they brought their readers extremely
2468934 take a look at 17 social shopping sites and look at the type of traffic and audience they attract
2468935 edwards although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2468936 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2468937 nothings been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow ive participated in the payment of money that is a lie absolute lie
2468938 i was at the beverly hilton i was there for a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake from becoming public
2468939 how innovations were evolved and implemented using proactive administrative methods based on relevance large civic participation and social equity for far reaching changes

2468941 for a lot of foreigners the only image of china comes from old movies that make us look poor and pathetic
2468942 now look at us we showed the world we can build new subways and beautiful modern buildings the olympics will redefine the way people see us

2468947 during my year in country i had five second lieutenant platoon leaders and four company commanders one co was pretty good all the rest were stupid
2468948 the stench of corruption rose to unprecedented levels during william c westmorelands command of the american effort in vietnam
2468949 kill them even if they try to surrender we need the body count
2468950 on board the command and control chopper rode the battalion commander his aviation support commander the artillery liaison officer the battalion s 3 and the battalion sergeant major they circled high enough to escape random small arms fire
2468951 in vietnam the officer corps simply did not die in sufficient numbers or in the presence of their men often enough
2468952 mutiny became so common that the army was forced to disguise its frequency by talking instead of combat refusal
2468953 resembled a strike and occurred when gis refused disobeyed or negotiated an order into combat
2468954 unlike mutinous outbreaks of the past which were usually sporadic short lived events the progressive unwillingness of american soldiers to fight to the point of open disobedience took place over a four year period between 1968 71
2468955 it was an organized strike a shaken brass relieved the company commander but they did not charge the guys with anything the brass surrendered to the strength of the organized men
2468956 we have no business there we just sat down then they promised us we wouldnt have to go to cambodia
2468957 you cant give orders and expect them to be obeyed
2468958 if troops are going to mutiny you cant pursue an aggressive policy
2468959 dont desert go to vietnam and kill your commanding officer
2468960 word of the deaths of officers will bring cheers at troop movies or in bivouacs of certain units
2468961 brass are calling this a tremendous victory we call it a goddam butcher shop if you want to die so some lifer can get a promotion go right ahead but if you think your life is worth something you better get yourselves together if you dont take care of the lifers they might damn well take care of you
2468962 his first sergeant later told him that when his men heard him refuse that order they removed a 350 bounty earlier placed on his head because they thought he was a hard liner
2468963 captain steinberg argues that once an officer is intimidated by even the threat of fragging he is useless to the military because he can no longer carry out orders essential to the functioning of the army through intimidation by threats verbal and written virtually all officers and ncos have to take into account the possibility of fragging before giving an order to the men under them
2468964 in parts of vietnam fragging stirs more fear among officers and ncos than does the war with charlie
2468965 many commanders no longer trusted blacks or radical whites with weapons except on guard duty or in combat
2468966 the american garrisons on the larger bases are virtually disarmed the lifers have taken the weapons from us and put them under lock and key
2468967 the military the leadership of this country are perceived by many soldiers to be almost as much our enemy as the vc and the nva
2468968 the unwilling led by the unqualified doing the unnecessary for the ungrateful
2468969 search and evade meaning tacit avoidance of combat by units in the field is now virtually a principle of war vividly expressed by the gi phrase cya cover your ass and get home
2468970 some units even took enemy weapons with them when they went out on such search and avoid missions so that upon return they could report a firefight and demonstrate evidence of enemy casualties for the body count figures required by higher headquarters
2468971 they have set up separate companies for men who refuse to go out into the field it is no big thing to refuse to go if a man is ordered to go to such and such a place he no longer goes through the hassle of refusing he just packs his shirt and goes to visit some buddies at another base camp
2468972 the men agreed and passed the word to other platoons nobody fires unless fired upon as of about 1100 hours on october 10 1971 the men of bravo company 11 12 first cav division declared their own private cease fire with the north vietnamese
2468973 an order to north vietnamese troops not to shoot u s soldiers wearing antiwar symbols or carrying their rifles pointed down
2468974 convincing me that i was on the side of the vietnamese now
2468975 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2468976 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2468977 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2468978 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2468979 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2468980 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2468981 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2468982 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2468983 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2468984 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2468985 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2468986 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2468987 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2468988 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2468989 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2468990 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2468991 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2468992 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2468993 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2468994 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2468995 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2468996 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2468997 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2469065 paris is determined to make a go of this club shes investing a lot of her own money into the project and believes she can make a go of it by roping in all her celeb pals to check it out
2469066 a small fortune is being spent on interior design paris wants a classy decadent feel to the space but with an animal print motif running throughout the ladies loos will be pink and shes getting diamante studded leather sofas and bar stools
2469067 she sourced the location about four months ago and has already paid for the lease which didnt come cheap the idea is to get the club up and running before the end of the year and to host the wildest new years eve party ever
2469068 paris has already promised her backers that shell get them free publicity through one of her reality tv shows
2469069 and her name alone is enough to get society kids and celebrities down the only slight teething problem is she still hasnt decided on a name after paris was ruled out shes now considering the paris hilton nightclub instead
2469070 shes at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart
2469071 the fact is jen and john are not getting married and probably never will
2469072 they were both angry about the false stories but then they ended up turning on each other because john made it a little too clear just how preposterous he thought the idea was
2469073 there is no doubt that jen wants to be with someone she can settle down with and start a family but its looking less and less likely that jon will be the man she does that with unless he has a radical change of heart

2469085 in general though the demise of hillarycare has been over studied in washington
2469086 we recognize however that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering and we expect that the district court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible these and the other remaining questions are within the expertise and competence of the district court to address in the first instance

2469089 as the mother of two teenage daughters i am very thankful that the washington post has so thoroughly reviewed the case and placed the resultant stories prominently on the front page the parents of the young woman believed that their daughter would return home safely and failing that the parents wanted to trust that those responsible for killing their only daughter would be brought to justice they are still waiting and so is the public

2469091 every night washington area churches send volunteers to share the word of god praise and worship counseling and clinical care are provided whenever the mission doors are open for those who respond to the nightly invitation to receive the lord as savior there is follow up prayer and counseling
2469092 one of the stones in section 60 has sunk and a family member has requested that it be raised today
2469093 sometimes the stories we tell about ourselves are just that stories
2469094 i know your degrees wont really prove anything but since you have a masters in counseling psychology it does show in kind of a roundabout way that you went through something that you tried to make sense of in your life
2469095 at least it proves that you are who you say you are
2469096 there are times when it is difficult for me to tell the difference between what was reality and what was my interior universe
2469097 um hi john remember jones beach back in july 1987 it was a wednesday
2469098 generations of iraqis have gone to school learning how they rid themselves of british imperialism
2469099 they are the constituency to which maliki must bend you dont want to go down in history as the man who sold iraq back to the foreigners
2469100 to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of great britain
2469101 this statement baffled those iraqis who heard it did it mean that they were about to be independent did it mean that they were becoming a colony did it really mean anything no iraqis could tell
2469102 however well meaning the mandate was always regarded by iraqs statesmen as inconsistent with their national self respect and it was correspondingly unpopular
2469103 we cant succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy
2469104 face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam
2469105 we must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there the strategy used successfully in anbar and elsewhere in iraq and we must empower the new civilian government of pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development health and education
2469106 the u s should support the people who are in office today if we fail the alternative is the happy go lucky mullahs
2469107 we have come with a reconciliatory approach it is time to let bygones be bygones in a new era
2469108 mixed big and little grand and ordinary public and private
2469109 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track
2469110 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians
2469111 we dont want to stop people from enjoying a night out or a summer barbeque but we want people to do it safely and responsibly that means staying sober and alert if driving
2469112 but its important to think about the consequences to yourself and your family of being involved in a serious collision if you drink alcohol and then drive
2469113 you could end up in a wheelchair be killed or be responsible for the death of someone else
2469114 along with our colleagues in the fire and ambulance service we are fully aware of the consequences of drink driving and the lives that are wrecked as a result
2469115 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel
2469116 i was born in the early hours of the morning on a day in late july
2469117 and as i entered this new world my parents old one was being destroyed
2469118 can you lay out what the landscape is there and what is the source of the conflict
2469119 and so the lion fell in love with l te lamb
2469120 non mi va di essere sempre loise lane voglio essere anche superman
2469121 correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
2469122 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
2469123 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
2469124 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
2469125 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
2469126 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
2469127 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
2469128 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
2469129 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
2469130 tu sei beh non esattamente lamore della mia vita perch mi aspetto di amarti molto pi a lungo sei lamore della mia esistenza
2469131 secondo la tradizione tu dovresti sostenere la mia posizione e io la tua
2469132 ed ecco tornare il mio incubo alla anna dai capelli rossi
2469133 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
2469134 do you want to swim with the dolphins this afternoon burn off the calories

2469139 do you want to swim with the dolphins this afternoon burn off the calories
2469140 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
2469141 a consistent libertarian must oppose private ownership of the and the wage slavery which is a component of this system as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer
2469142 t o demonise state authoritarianism while ignoring identical albeit contract consecrated subservient arrangements in the large scale corporations which control the world economy is fetishism at its worst
2469143 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
2469144 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2469145 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
2469146 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
2469147 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
2469148 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
2469149 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
2469150 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
2469151 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
2469152 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
2469153 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2469154 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
2469155 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
2469156 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
2469157 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
2469158 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
2469159 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
2469160 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2469161 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
2469162 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
2469163 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
2469164 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
2469165 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2469166 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
2469167 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
2469168 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
2469169 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
2469170 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
2469171 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
2469172 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
2469173 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
2469174 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2469175 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2469176 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
2469177 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2469178 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
2469179 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
2469180 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
2469181 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
2469182 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
2469183 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
2469184 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2469185 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
2469186 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2469187 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
2469188 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
2469189 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
2469190 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
2469191 im pretty satisfied with the time i didnt think id swim that fast in preliminaries all i know is i want to be in the middle lane of the pool tomorrow
2469192 people tend to shade the south side of the house but must do so carefully
2469193 its best if the canopy is high enough to shade the roof in summer but in winter the suns warming rays can heat the house without the branches blocking any light allowing full southern sun exposure for warmth in the winter outweighs the benefits of summer shade on the south

2469213 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2469214 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2469215 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2469216 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2469217 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2469218 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2469219 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2469220 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2469328 she broke the rules of the game and got things done joan believed in a theatre for the people and not the wishy washy 19th century liberal humanist tradition in which the working classes are conjoined to appreciate art for their own amelioration something joan found patronising a denial of genuine working class values and an obfuscation of the system of oppression

2469332 the actor has to discard whatever means he has learned of persuading the audience to identify itself with the characters which he plays his way of speaking has to be free from ecclesiastical singsong and from all those cadences which lull the spectator so that the sense gets lost
2469333 we have today all the sort of superficial brechtian theatrical techniques at our hand but his politics is usually lost in most performances

2469384 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risked very little is enjoyed a position over those who offered up their work and themselves our judgment we strive on negative criticism and which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful then our criticism designating itself but there are times where a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new not everyone can become a great artist but a great artist can come from anywhere
2469385 people has always seen a genius as someone with superior memory ability in the 13th century thomas aquinas 1 was admired for his ability to compose his summa theologica entirely in his head memorising the quran is considered a supreme achievement among muslims and there are other traditions of memory training in other cultures too a strong memory was seen as the greatest virtues since it represented the internalisation of a universe of external knowledge
2469386 twenty years ago climate research became politicised in favour of one particular hypothesis which redefined the subject as the study of the effect of greenhouse gases as a result the rebellious spirits essential for innovative and trustworthy science are greeted with impediments to their research careers and while the media usually find mavericks at least entertaining in this case they often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
2469387 enthusiasm for the global warming scare also ensures that heatwaves make headlines while contrary symptoms such as this winters billion dollar loss of californian crops to unusual frost are relegated to the business pages the early arrival of migrant birds in spring provides colourful evidence for a recent warming of the northern lands but did anyone tell you that in east antarctica the ad lie penguins and cape petrels are turning up at their spring nesting sites around nine days later than they did 50 years ago while sea ice has diminished in the arctic since 1978 it has grown by 8 in the southern ocean
2469388 the solar physicists say that the sun drives climate changes more emphatically than greenhouse gases do after becoming much more active during the 20th century the sun now stands at a high but roughly level state of activity solar physicists warn of possible global cooling should the sun revert to the lazier mood it was in during the little ice age 300 years ago climate history and related archeology give solid support to the solar hypothesis the 20th century episode were in the 21st century mind you or modern warming was just the latest in a long string of similar events produced by a hyperactive sun of which the last was the medieval warming the chinese population doubled then while in europe the vikings and cathedral builders prospered fascinating relics of earlier episodes come from the swiss alps with the rediscovery in 2003 of a long forgotten pass used intermittently whenever the world was warm

2469403 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2469404 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2469405 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2469406 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2469407 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2469408 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2469409 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2469410 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2469504 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2469505 sempre que me deixo absorver profundamente por suas belas cria es
2469506 parece me encontrar sob a superf cie po tica as mesmas suposi es antecipadas os interesses e conclus es que reconhe o como meus pr prios
2469507 ficou me a impress o de que o senhor sabe por intui o realmente a partir de uma fina auto observa o tudo que tenho descoberto em outras pessoas por meio de laborioso trabalho
2469508 n o se pode ser pleno poeta e pleno m dico ao mesmo tempo
2469509 posso medi tar o quanto quiser sobre a ntima liga o entre medicina e poesia e n o obstante permanece verdade que n o se pode ser pleno poeta e pleno m dico ao mesmo tempo jogado para l e para c entre ci ncia e arte n o entrego meu pleno eu a nenhuma das duas e me atrapalho pela poesia no trabalho e pelo trabalho na poesia
2469510 n o um simples processo de transfigura o do real pr prio de toda atividade po tica mas a completa substitui o de uma realidade hist rico social por uma outra fict cia e ilus ria a sublima o de uma sociedade concreta por um pitoresco seguro e ordenado mundo de f bula

2469513 durante todos esses anos nunca procurei sua companhia e usufru uma conversa com o senhor
2469514 a mim causa singular impress o comprovar que minhas hist rias cl nicas carecem por assim dizer do severo selo da ci ncia e que apresentam mais um car ter liter rio mas consolo me pensando que este resultado depende inteiramente da natureza do objeto e n o de minhas prefer ncias pessoais o diagn stico local e as rea es el tricas n o t m efic cia alguma na histeria enquanto uma exposi o detalhada dos processos ps quicos tal como estamos habituados a encontrar na literatura me permite chegar por meio de um n mero limitado de f rmulas psicol gicas a um certo conhecimento da origem de uma histeria
2469515 por algum aspecto eu me constituo no duplo do professor freud ele me definiu certa vez como seu g meo ps quico na literatura percorro a mesma estrada sobre a qual freud avan a com uma temeridade surpreendente na ci ncia entretanto ambos o poe ta e o psicanalista olhamos atrav s da janela da alma
2469516 you start thinking gee cheech looks funny without his mustache and whos that frog fucking him it looks like don johnson
2469517 as i listened to cheech insult my ability as a writer

2469519 il leone non cattivo come un signore affamato a cui non portano da mangiare non aver paura della pantera una signora che aspetta da troppo che il semaforo diventi verde il gorilla invece nervoso perch non gli piace vestirsi sempre di nero
2469520 mamma mamma pap cos ricco perch ogni volta che gli cadono i denti gli cadono tutti assieme e il topolino gli lascia tanti soldi sotto il cuscino
2469521 aspetta che ora pap si toglie il catetere e poi andiamo a sederci sulla panchina e diamo da mangiare ai piccioni
2469522 ma lo sai che se poi giochi troppo con la palla ti devi mettere una gamba finta come quella che ha la mamma

2469538 michael does a wonderful job of attacking whatever is in front of him that day
2469539 one of the guys actually asked me when i push off am i exhaling or am i holding my breath underwater
2469540 and my answer was i have no idea i dont think about anything when i swim i just get in the water and race
2469541 if they gave out black belts for handling pressure hed be a sixth degree
2469542 i knew it would be a very very tough race to win but i didnt care
2469543 i wanted to swim it i like challenges when i make my goals theyre all challenges
2469544 ive said this before and ill say it again i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
2469545 im by no means downplaying his accomplishments what he did was and still is the greatest olympic performance of all time and he will be always remembered as the greatest or one of the greatest olympians of all time im just looking to hopefully do something different in the sport than what he did

2469562 people really are selling their talent in a way that can make them money
2469563 they really know that if they work with the government theyll benefit
2469564 he went from being this renegade making films that were banned and an eyesore for the chinese government to kind of being the pet of the government in some peoples eyes
2469565 now the government wants directors to promote the countrys economic development
2469566 and the directors need money and fame and they can earn even more money with government support
2469567 most enemies of the people during that time fell into the category of the five bad elements
2469568 so those 10 years from 1966 until 1976 i lived under the shadow of tragedy and hopelessness
2469569 but he once told me that people are shackled by politics
2469570 i dont want to say much now but we spent the whole night sleepless because of that event i trusted zhang yimou i felt he cared for his nation
2469571 at the end of the film ju dou has a huge fire and that represents our emotion
2469572 if you insist on doing nothing to support the film but keep on delaying and cutting down the movie and eventually destroying it i cannot imagine how the chinese government and the whole chinese population will think of you and miramax
2469573 i truly believe no one could stop their anger you will be hurting not only me but also the whole chinese population
2469574 why would he continue to make movies that challenge the political system
2469575 for a century this is the most important time for the chinese to host all of the guests coming from all over the world
2469576 i took this job to a great extent because i wanted to do something for the chinese people
2469577 thats just what the red river looks like on the maps ive perused from time to time
2469578 although the upa and nda somehow managed to stall me from becoming the prime minister but the developments helped the party achieve in six days what it would otherwise have managed in six to seven years
2469579 ours is a nationalist party and our contribution in this regard is known to the people of maharashtra hence supporting such maoists is not possible in this regard we do not believe any such narco test
2469580 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2469581 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2469582 ours is a nationalist party and our contribution in this regard is known to the people of maharashtra hence supporting such maoists is not possible in this regard we do not believe any such narco test

2469597 obama has an incredibly compelling story to tell women in terms of his background his own economic struggle his single mom going to school relating to their concerns

2469612 there was always music in the house when i was growing up here
2469613 mom was always singing and playing piano my dad played guitar and loudie was around often playing some new song
2469614 a couple of years later i was teaching a workshop at the swannanoa gathering in asheville n c
2469615 it was contemporary folk song week sam got up he must have been in about his third year of college and sang in front of me for the first time there was so much power and passion in his voice he just announced himself to the world here i am it was a very emotional moment for me but i had to keep it together because i was teaching
2469616 ive been playing at all the usual venues like the town crier in pawling
2469617 its pretty hectic sometimes because ive also got a day job as a geologist still i recently managed to complete a five song cd the sampler every so often of course i open for my mom when shes playing how many times
2469618 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2469619 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2469620 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2469621 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2469622 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2469623 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2469632 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2469633 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2469634 i think we represented canada the best we could and that was the goal coming into this race
2469635 hes very tall with long arms and i was on the defensive too much
2469636 i felt ok out there but it was a tough fight because hes the world champion

2469638 there are really two key parts to being well prepared psychologically and the first is knowing what those factors are
2469639 they need to know what they need to attend to what they need to think of what they need to focus on
2469640 athletes at this level know what these factors are but the key part is that they can manage themselves physiologically to allow that to happen
2469641 there is so much hype leading up to the olympics there are medal expectations and you cant block it all off completely
2469642 some people really handle the spotlight well and others dont
2469643 a sign of a true champion is one that excels when the lights are the strongest
2469644 when everyones rooting for you and you still do well that shows some very very strong mental will
2469645 the race is in his hands that takes a huge pressure off
2469646 ill go out there and give it 100 per cent but if i come third or tenth or if i trip and fall its in his hands
2469647 when im having fun thats when i race the best
2469648 its something we discussed to see if it was a good idea or not for him to carry the flag and of course he wanted to do that
2469649 so then we created a plan about how to manage that effectively its really thinking about how to be a professional going into the games
2469650 i think the pressure of competing in the olympics has always been the same but theres way more media now watching the olympics so theres probably more pressure from that perspective
2469651 they are competing against the some of the best players in the world are running the same distance
2469652 we remind them their opponents are just as nervous as they are
2469653 often well have meetings the night before to go over and remind them of what they want to be thinking of and the kind of emotional level they want to have
2469654 during the competition i have them write in their journals everyday their thoughts how they felt
2469655 its important so that they can understand all of their highs and lows
2469656 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2469657 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2469658 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2469659 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2469660 it may only seem like a 1 50 a month or 3 a month but it will certainly add up to big revenue for bell and for telus and its really unfair for the consumer
2469661 all of a sudden the rules have changed and people are being told about on one months notice
2469662 everybodys finding it tougher to make ends meet at the end of the month and you add up all these charges this kind of gouging its not fair its not right and we wanna see legislation to put a stop to it
2469663 itd be a little like if canada post asked you to put a second stamp on every letter that came to your house its nuts
2469664 demand for gold has been resilient to global market conditions
2469665 the sharp rise in prices seen earlier this year has been a prime driver in improving export volumes and has boosted the role of gold as an inflation hedging instrument
2469666 given the current bullish sentiment of investors and golds safe haven status the outlook for gold trade is promising in the remaining months of 2008
2469667 the main thing putting a fire under the market is that crude oil prices continue to come down that is lifting everything that is not in the energy patch
2469668 we would not be surprised if over the next few weeks the dollar resumed its extended period of depreciation
2469669 there is a perception that when you compare the u s economy to the economies of the euro zone and the united kingdom we look pretty good
2469670 there is a perception that they are falling faster into a deeper recession and that we in the u s are muddling through
2469671 the market is celebrating a 5 drop in oil prices but were not out of the woods yet
2469672 oil prices are still 50 a barrel more than they should be
2469673 the agency recognizes that a number of factors have contributed to high corn food and fuel prices as a nation
2469674 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2469675 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2469676 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2469677 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2469678 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2469679 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry
2469680 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling

2469685 because the system is a tool that companies will use year after year we didnt want to put a time limit on the free projects for the beta test participants with so many organizations today working with remote employees telecommuters and international teams this system gives businesses and non profit organizations access to the tools they need to keep their projects on track
2469686 our goal is to introduce companies to what we call project management for the rest of us
2469687 pelotonics gives personal productivity fans like me the opportunity to increase the productivity of their teams as well
2469688 the market potential for mobile saas solutions is tremendous as business users and consumers seek easy to use mobile messaging and collaboration capabilities on all the devices they use anywhere anytime

2469692 i decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own

2469718 the august 2006 issue of applied and environmental microbiology contained an article written by dr
2469719 forensic application of microbiological culture analysis to identify mail intentionally contaminated with bacillus anthracis spores
2469720 individuals familiar with the compositions of the powders in the letters have indicated that they were comprised simply of spores purified to different extents
2469721 that the spores were produced using additives and sophisticated engineering supposedly akin to military weapon production
2469722 this idea is usually the basis for implying that the powders were inordinately dangerous compared to spores alone the persistent credence given to this impression fosters erroneous preconceptions which may misguide research and preparedness efforts and generally detract from the magnitude of hazards posed by simple spore preparations
2469723 the fbi would not allow beecher to be interviewed about his article

2469752 our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2469753 i call for an immediate ceasefire russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2469754 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility

2469758 its going to be a great atmosphere for the first game
2469759 we have to play with that hunger and that desire in order to come out and be successful hopefully going into the first game we really come up to the plate early and try to make a statement about how were going to play throughout the tournament
2469760 by no means a situation where its going to be handed to us
2469761 weve got to go out and take it and were definitely going to be put to a challenge
2469762 everyones role is clearly defined when they come into the game they know they have to bring energy bring that hunger
2469763 obviously by what happened in 04 lebron d wade melo boozer are really doing a good job of showing that hunger and i think everybodys following their lead

2469765 i know people label me as a great defensive player
2469766 but a great defensive team will beat a great defensive player any day
2469767 we know that with the guys we have were not going to have a problem scoring so if the defense is there every night in case the offense slips then we still have a chance to win the ball game
2469768 the pick and roll is obviously the hardest to defend in any game whether its international or in the nba or in an oriental country
2469769 the good thing about it is we have guys like dwight and chris bosh who are quick and athletic that can be able to get up there
2469770 also we have guys on the weak side like deron and d wade and melo and those guys can be able to cover the basket while the

2469838 while the monitor has shown the effect that rising energy and food prices can have on the economic and spending confidence of consumers we are now learning that decreasing home and asset values may weigh just as heavily on their confidence
2469839 consumers are facing a headwind from several directions since it is unlikely that gas prices will return to last years levels home values are still declining and the stock market has been bearish
