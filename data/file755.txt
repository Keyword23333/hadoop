7550042 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence
7550043 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released
7550044 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years
7550045 it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7550046 all the issues including the fate of jerusalem the refugees the settlements and the borders should be resolved we will not accept any other accord
7550047 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
7550048 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
7550049 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
7550050 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7550051 in my home state of georgia theres a sense that well a democrat cant win here competitively cant be competitive on the national level well weve seen in our lives we had a president from this state in our lifetime in the 70s the state supported clinton in his first election and was very close in the second election so theres no question just a few years ago it was competitive so i think its a mistake to write off georgia
7550052 the release of this group fills us with joy but we will not be satisfied until all prisoners are released the 11 000 who are still waiting

7550073 our hearts are heavy at this moment for the two deceased individuals including one of our own employees and the additional injured workers
7550074 we have worked closely with them on their safety programs and feel very confident that this was one of the premiere contractors on this job site
7550075 not a real long one but it was kind of like our normal monday of game week
7550076 we followed up on our western michigan prep and we got some good on good were getting ready to go
7550077 well give them a little bit of time off this weekend to get their legs back underneath them
7550078 we start school on monday so well get all that in order and ready to roll on monday
7550079 we got a lot accomplished but we still have a lot to do and a long way to go the attitude has been good the commitment has been good and thats a good thing
7550080 you never know what to expect i think well play well i have a lot of confidence in this group
7550081 they always tell me i have it easier than them because they had two a days every day for three straight weeks they just tell me to keep working hard because it will all work out in the end if i keep that attitude
7550082 hes really excited and ever since he decided to come here he got real excited about football again
7550083 with the more option running and zone reads it definitely makes it different on the perimeter with who youre going to block
7550084 its not set once you get on the line you cant be like i gotta block that guy its after the play develops you find out who youve gotta block thats the main difference for me in this camp
7550085 when you have the player of the year in basketball and football i guess its not surprising about how athletic he is in last weeks scrimmage i wanted to see is he physical it seemed like he stepped up
7550086 hes a guy that i can say right now because he understands the game really intelligent that probably will be part of the fold when the season starts
7550087 once again theyre all learning and understanding where their help is and how to play within this scheme i kind of like what im seeing from all of those guys theyre competing and theyre getting better every day
7550088 i think its one of the strengths of our football team theyre good theyre physical theyre playing well coach is doing a great job with them i like that group and were developing some depth there i feel pretty good about our o line

7550096 expect americas nba heroes to continue sacrificing their summers in quest of olympic gold even after returning the united states to global supremacy smiles were still locked on the faces of the us nba superstars after their 118 107 triumph over spain in sundays gold medal game when usa basketball general manager jerry colangelo said half of them were ready to return in 2012 well celebrate and then we will talk about going forward colangelo said five or six of these guys have said they want to be part of us going forward but now its time for a rest i think so
7550097 its placing a barrier between what you would project to be the ignition or explosion area and the seal
7550098 you are trying to protect the seal from the blast force
7550099 caterpillar machines are instrumental to our success and we have great confidence in the products coupled with after sales service and support provided by al bahar which are strategic to our achievements and successful execution of projects
7550100 there are several ways to monitor concrete maturity one is mathematical models which have a high margin of error construction tends to take longer because theres such a safety factor to make sure the concrete is really cured
7550101 there are also wired sensors but the wire has to be removed later you can throw our tags right into the concrete and read them with a handheld
7550102 when people think of rfid they tend to think about epc and wal mart type applications
7550103 we see rfid as an intelligent wireless product rather than a standard epc identifier it is like a computer you can embed in something and access wirelessly
7550104 these fines are related to citations we are already contesting
7550105 given the seriousness of the situation those types of assessments are not necessarily unusual
7550106 bruce clark mine manager and chuck heyne shift supervisor engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence
7550107 exposed employees to a hazard of being struck by falling material
7550108 were known yet the company failed to ensure the area was safe for miners to work and to travel
7550109 and i think thats quite significant it shows the emphasis we place and have placed on worker safety at the mine
7550110 marc gasol walked off the court silver medal draped around his neck proud and disappointed and happy all at once
7550111 cas ruled that abrahamian should have been given another round as a penalty awarded against him hadnt been assessed until after the second round of his 84 kilogram bout had ended abrahamian as a result automatically lost the match cas also criticized the judges at the match for not listening to the swedish protests
7550112 while its true that he led the giants on that great drive before the half in dallas its also true that manning became the beneficiary of consistently great field position thanks to turnovers and changes of possession
7550113 manning didnt have to win games though he did his role was not to lose games now the future of the giants defense is uncertain and the pressure shifts to manning
7550114 redeem teams strong play will be felt way beyond the host country
7550115 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
7550116 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were injuries
7550117 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7550118 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7550119 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase

7550122 i am thrilled to be taking on the role of associate dean for faculty development and distance education but also frightened to be stepping into a role that was so marvelously managed by marieke van willigen
7550123 she left olympic sized shoes to fill but also has done a wonderful job preparing me for my new role
7550124 i have a great deal of experience as a successful teacher and scholar as well as experience developing and teaching distance education courses i hope that my wide range of experiences will help me serve the college faculty well in my new role as an administrator

7550136 wow that blond girl just smiled at me that was so nice no one ever smiles at me like that for no reason what a nice girl
7550137 um hate to burst your bubble but it might be because of the cute dog looking out the window from the back seat

7550145 oh great a nice thick black cock i can wrap my lips around
7550146 i packed up your pictures and things if you want them
7550147 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
7550148 yes thats me its a nelly furtado song i mean technically the song is about not being a one trick pony but not a one trick pony was kind of a stupid name for a network so instead im one trick pony i dont know what my trick is though

7550157 when formerly free phone to text service jott announced they would start charging for its smartest functions this week it caught a lot of fans by surprise good free things cant last forever but once you get used to adding calendar appointments and to do items emailing or texting friends and even blogging directly from a phone call its hard to imagine losing those tools while 4 month isnt an unfair price many folks just dont shell out for web based services and in many cases they might not need to here are some of the best ways to capture your thoughts and to dos while on the go from any cellphone with or without voice transcription
7550158 every environment is different the resources are different what you can use and what the people will accept is even different
7550159 even if you discover something that has already been done you have to figure out how to get it accepted here you have to be able to work with people on a human level those were our challenges in the beginning we realized early that half of our job was going to be to sell the solution
7550160 when i was at physician assistant school i never even considered that i would do anything like this
7550161 the reality of it is when you get out into your job you have to look around in the environment to find out what the problems are and decide how you re going to fix them
7550162 when we got here all we could see is what we could not do
7550163 we had to learn and accept what we could do and do it to the best of our ability once we got to that phase we took off like a runaway train it almost got simpler when we took a step back you cant solve all of these childrens individual medical problems but you can tackle very simple things that is going to impact a lot of people
7550164 once we convinced them to taste it they realized it was a good thing and they all gave their verbal pledge which is a big deal
7550165 they all stood up and agreed that their village and their families would use it
7550166 everything that we are doing goes back to clean their water
7550167 we are really trying to get to the lowest common denominator with everything
7550168 we are using this particular recipe because there is no cooking required
7550169 the types of ingredients we are using are not water based so this can stand on a shelf without refrigeration for four months this really works perfectly it wont go bad it wont cause disease and it wont cause sickness
7550170 we can teach them to make this the materials are here in the country and they can sustain this they just need to know how to do it and know that it exists
7550171 the children dont have to actually chew it they can suck on it they dont have to have a lot of strength or teeth
7550172 they are educated they see what we are doing for them and they are very appreciative one of the reasons they are so happy about this is they see us doing something and they know they can do it too
7550173 it is not just something we will implement while we are here and then we leave it is gone they are going to take this and they are going to run with it they want their kids to survive and now they are getting the tools to do it and realizing they can do it themselves
7550174 it is not unrealistic to cut the child birth mortality rate in half in an area with the implementation of this course
7550175 we are ready to see these programs moved on to a larger scale
7550176 the taliban works to say we are infidels i think the people we affect with our work see that we are trying to learn their ways and see that we are trying to adapt to their way we are trying to find ways to help them while respecting their culture an acceptance based on this will allow us to take big steps forward in working ourselves out of a job
7550177 a brief pitch that demonstrates an understanding of my blogs typical topics
7550178 oh its just our neighbors were on a party line
7550179 yeah but it wont make any difference they cant hear us because all we hear when theyre online is a

7550181 at first i was frightened of being overwhelmed by all those old feelings
7550182 im really angry they are young 16 to 20 years old
7550183 they are too young i cant believe theyre doing that
7550184 i think this is important if people get a problem just give the money to them
7550185 safety is important i hope everybody has safety in their life
7550186 were feeling positive about these guys getting caught or at least we can make them have second thoughts about doing it again everybodys got to keep supporting each other and not letting these thugs get the upper hand its a major urban city you know crime happens we cant let it stop us from pursuing our livelihoods and make us live in fear thats no way to live im not willing to live that way
7550187 they were pretty uncertain about where to stand where to go what to do
7550188 they werent extremely confident in their actions the impression was that they had this idea maybe saw the news on tv and they thought about it a little bit but havent been at this very long
7550189 si vienen a buscar las pastillas no se puede estar condicionando la entrega pregunt ndoles si la pide porque va a tener sexo esta noche o ya tuvo sexo anoche es una locura
7550190 continuar con la entrega porque estamos ante un fallo que no est firme incluso lo vamos a apelar porque consideramos que la p ldora del d a despu s no es abortiva y eso est fuera de discusi n
7550191 el m todo previene 85 por ciento de embarazos probables lo que contrasta con la eficacia de la anticoncepci n cl sica continua que previene 99 por ciento de los embarazos durante el per odo de un a o su mecanismo de acci n est relacionado con el ciclo f rtil de la mujer si la toma ocurre hasta cinco d as antes de que se produzca la ovulaci n la p ldora interfiere con el transporte y la vitalidad del espermatozoide por alteraci n del moco cervical y tambi n impide la liberaci n del vulo anulando la ovulaci n previniendo de esa manera el encuentro de vulo y espermatozoide no produce ning n tipo de trastorno en el endometrio como fue demostrado en estudios realizados en monas y ratas en los que el levonorgestrel no impidi la nidaci n o implantaci n y por biopsias endometriales en mujeres consumidoras de levonorgestrel en los que se demostr que no hay interferencia con el desarrollo progestacional del endometrio condici n imprescindible para que el vulo fecundado anide en el tero todo ello descalifica la teor a de quienes le atribuyen a la anticoncepci n de emergencia capacidad abortiva tampoco interrumpe un embarazo ya producido ni lo modifica
7550192 no me llama la atenci n que la iglesia pretenda prohibirla lo que me sorprenden son los jueces decir que es abortiva es una falacia es fundamentalismo puro
7550193 el r tulo de abortivo se lo gan gratuitamente en base a experiencias que se hicieron en ratas y conejas en la d cada del 60 en la universidad de yale en modelos no adecuados para compararlos con humanos ratas y conejas requieren para la implantaci n del embri n un pico de estradiol es lo que hace que el endometrio se haga receptivo al embri n este mecanismo es distinto en monas y mujeres las monas en general preparan su endometrio con antelaci n a la ovulaci n y con posterioridad a la ovulaci n se inicia una fase totalmente espont nea que se llama fase progestacional o l tea en la cual se produce la implantaci n del embri n en ratas y conejas esta fase no es espont nea se produce con el coito si no tienen coito no hay fase l tea en seres humanos ocurre igual que con los monos si se insemina artificialmente a la mujer independientemente de que haya habido coito o no y se fertliza el vulo el embri n se implantar en el endometrio progestacional espont neo

7550195 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7550196 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7550197 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7550198 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7550199 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7550200 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7550201 together with nortel we are advancing the state of the art in ballpark design and technological innovation
7550202 more than just sharing our vision nortel has enhanced it offering a solution that will seamlessly integrate technology into our business operations to help increase our productivity and service to fans
7550203 this new unified communications solution will enable the mets to deliver a whole new fan experience at their new home
7550204 because the mets will be able to reach the right person at the right time via the right device ballpark and corporate staff will be more efficient and effective this speaks to the power of unified communications the ability to determine if a person is available and the best way to reach them instantly increasing the tempo of business operations and enabling a much more nimble enterprise
7550205 this occurred because credit cardholders were not provided adequate guidance on items considered unallowable and managers were not consistently monitoring purchases
7550206 canucks sports amp entertainment is committed to delivering world class entertainment and sporting events to our fans and partners throughout british columbia
7550207 nortel is the official converged network equipment supplier for the vancouver 2010 winter games and has experience in outfitting sports arenas
7550208 that certainly helped us make the decision to choose nortel as the provider for general motors place
7550209 like all of our recent sports arena wins the solution were implementing at general motors place shows that unified communications is about entertainment and productivity

7550230 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7550231 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7550232 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7550233 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7550234 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7550235 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7550236 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7550237 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7550238 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7550239 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7550240 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7550241 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis

7550245 minister roches comments that a second lisbon referendum was needed has confirmed the publics fear that the government intends to re run the lisbon vote when the time is right and an effective pro treaty marketing strategy has been put in place
7550246 while the government claims it will make no decision on this matter until after its detailed analysis of the referendum defeat has been completed and considered it is clear that it intends using the findings of this research to present to the public with the same rejected treaty dressed up as something new
7550247 irish people must not allow our government treat us with such contempt our politicians must be respect their constitutional duty and obey the sovereign will of the voters
7550248 the government is using taxpayers money to mount an extensive confidential poll to
7550249 show that the government has learned nothing from its disastrous referendum campaign another referendum on lisbon without any response to the concerns of the irish people would be rejected
7550250 unfortunately dick roches remarks smack of arrogance and an inability to recognise the sensitivity surrounding the lisbon treaty
7550251 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
7550252 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
7550253 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
7550254 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
7550255 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

7550257 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant

7550260 the end of the republican party as they know it
7550261 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7550262 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7550263 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7550264 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7550265 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7550266 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7550267 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7550268 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7550269 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7550270 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7550271 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7550272 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes

7550276 jew hating conspiracy theory obsessed blame your shitty life on the jews so you dont have to take responsibility for it
7550277 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7550278 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7550279 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7550280 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7550281 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7550282 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7550283 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7550284 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7550285 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7550286 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7550287 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7550288 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7550289 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7550290 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7550291 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7550292 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7550293 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7550294 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7550295 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7550296 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7550297 went to bring his hands up to catch his fall
7550298 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7550299 we shall do all that is possible to save them

7550304 instead of glorifying the events with a dramatic soft focus his memories and thoughts are crystal clear even when they are slightly contradicting moving from sf to ny to be part of something made perfect sense even when it didnt
7550305 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7550306 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7550307 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7550308 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7550309 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7550310 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7550311 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7550312 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7550313 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7550314 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7550315 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7550316 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7550317 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope

7550320 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty

7550327 denkst du nicht wir haben gr ssere probleme als dieses du h ttest besser daf r gesorgt dass der blick ber die personalsituation beim zp schreibt
7550328 ah hoi andreas hab dich gar nicht bemerkt war brigens gerade auf deiner seite toller artikel heute in der abendzeitung g ll
7550329 von mir aus d rfen diese jugendlichen gerne dort auf der plattform sein das ist nicht so ein problem aber sagen sie ihnen bitte sie sollen gef lligst ruhig sein und nicht immer unter die lichtschranke treten so dass die t re ununterbrochen ffnet und schliesst
7550330 sie loset sie mal in der ersten klasse waren zwei jugendliche die haben h llisch krach gemacht haben sie die gesehen
7550331 ja die habe ich gesehen sie sind in lenzburg dann ausgestiegen
7550332 ja dann ist gut ich war eben zuerst dort im erstklass wagen als es mir zu bl d wurde bin ich dann hier in dieses abteil gefl chtet
7550333 sind sie auch so scharf wie der kondukteur im artikel und kassieren immer sofort einen klassenwechsel
7550334 hm ja soweit ich weiss stand da nirgends dass der kondukteur im artikel immer sofort einen klassenwechsel verlangt aber hm ich bin schon einer der die fahrg ste dann bittet in die zweite klasse zu wechseln
7550335 hm ja also eigentlich bin ich der kondukteur der dort erw hnt wurde
7550336 ach sieeeee sind das ou schad ist meine frau nicht hier der muss ich heute abend gleich mal noch erz hlen dass ich sie getroffen habe
7550337 wissen sie meine frau rgert sich immer t dlich ber diese zweitkl ssler und gestern hat sie mir den gratis blick nach hause gebracht und mir den artikel gezeigt
7550338 ach so ich verstehe ja dann richten sie ihrer frau einen lieben gruss aus sch nen abend noch
7550339 nun will man auch noch kontrollen machen damit die guten 1 klasse fahrer ja nicht gest rt werden was f r eine frechheit

7550341 a strong line of enquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7550342 police enquiries into the circumstances are continuing but the officer in command stressed that officers were not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident
7550343 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group

7550348 foul shame amp be on ye all who turn the good to evil
7550349 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7550350 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7550351 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7550352 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7550353 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7550354 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7550355 i voted for the bill before i voted against it

7550357 at ground level one can only imagine the sheer beauty of mountain ranges deserts and deltas seen high up from nasas satellites one can imagine yes however they wouldnt be quite prepared for the fact that from 400 miles away the earth transforms into abstract art the global landscape is impressionist cubist and pointillist mother nature is an abstract artist
7550358 weve secretly replaced these peoples windows vista with folgers crystals and the coffee actually works better as an operating system than the years in development software that microsoft created who knew

7550364 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7550365 when i told paul yesterday that i was going to be doing it he laid there and said make sure you dont roll it to the mound
7550366 there is no quick way to get from where i was to get to 42nd and redman
7550367 when i pulled up there theres cruisers stacked up at 42nd street like you wouldnt believe
7550368 thats why were doing it to make him proud of what were doing and what he represents and what we represent
7550369 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7550370 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7550371 there is a lot of smack talk going on between the two teams sanchez said
7550372 were ready for them they think theyre ready for us i dont think so

7550384 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
7550385 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
7550386 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
7550387 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7550388 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account
7550389 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
7550390 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will

7550393 someone wants to talk to me about the womens boathouse who knew
7550394 but its an important issue its important to a large number of athletes you have to get into it and figure out how it works

7550408 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7550409 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7550410 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7550411 actualmente algunos periodistas son extorsionadores pol ticos y hablan mal de todo el mundo pero nadie habla de ellos porque sino empiezan con la censura a la libertad de prensa esto es indignante
7550412 afortunadamente la entidad fopea foro de periodistas argentinos busca mejorar la condici n tica de la profesi n y el rigor profesional es decir que se utilicen las normas que corresponden y se hable con fundamentos de las cuestiones hay un c digo de tica que est publicado y que plantea estas cuestiones entre otras cosas dice que no se pueden emitir opiniones irresponsables sino que deben ser opiniones fundadas que si se acusa a alguien tiene que ser con pruebas no se puede acusar a alguien de culpable si la justicia no se ha expedido adem s hay que chequear las informaciones y consultar varias fuentes antes de decir las cosas de esto falta mucho en el periodismo argentino pero hay posibilidades de mejorarlo y ojala lo logremos pronto
7550413 estoy pensando seriamente en hacer una presentaci n al inadi por las cosas que salen en los comentarios y opiniones de lectores en las p ginas web en esos espacios se dicen cosas irreproducibles y esto no puede ser la persona responsable de cada p gina debe hacerse cargo de lo que dice su espacio hay que controlar m s el correo de lectores
7550414 por otra parte actualmente hay algunos colegas que se han transformado en extorsionadores pol ticos y se creen con derecho de hablar mal de todo el mundo pero nadie puede hablar de ellos porque sino empiezan con la censura a la libertad de prensa esto es indignante es una total falta de tica muchos periodistas hablan por hablar y hacen mucho da o y dicen cualquier cosa pero jam s salen a pedir disculpas o a desmentir lo que dijeron en el gobierno de alfons n recuerdo que se debati el derecho a r plica es decir que si salen a hablar mal de uno uno tiene derecho a tener el mismo espacio para defenderse porque sino cualquiera dice cualquier cosa total nadie te hace nada
7550415 todo el mundo tiene derecho a opinar y decir lo que piensa el problema es cuando una cr nica o una noticia es el escondite para dar opiniones o apa ar una situaci n u otra las cr nicas son las cr nicas y deben ser lo m s objetivas posibles con fuentes chequeadas y las dos campanas y los comentarios y opiniones son otra cosa y deben estar perfectamente esclarecidos de que son eso y no una noticia adem s es importante que tengan la firma responsable y no un seud nimo o sobrenombre
7550416 yo por ejemplo cuando voy escuchando una radio escucho las noticias pero cuando los periodistas empiezan a opinar cambio enseguida porque no hay que dejarse manipular o influenciar por la opini n de un periodista uno tiene que ser capaz de escuchar una noticia y sacar sus propias conclusiones muchos colegas piensan que porque tienen un micr fono son los due os de la verdad y no es as esto tambi n hay que corregir lo mismo que en el momento de hablar de un tema espec fico como ser los radares de ezeiza en los temas complejos los periodistas tienen que saber que sus conocimientos tienen limitaciones y hay que darle lugar a una persona que entienda del tema para que lo explique y no opinar uno
7550417 no se puede seguir diciendo la mentira de soy neutral o soy independiente eso no existe siempre hay intereses creados y no estoy hablando solo de los medios que reciben publicidad del gobierno sino tambi n de aquellos empresarios de diversos rubros que son due os de sus propios medios y los utilizan a favor de sus empresas o tambi n de los periodistas que son due os de un medio y apadrinados por ciertos empresarios
7550418 pasa que a los medios argentinos nos falta autocr tica hay que empezar a hacer esto para mejorar y ser profesionales m s responsables
7550419 en la nueva ley de radiodifusi n hay que promover un debate en la sociedad para tener en cuenta las normas que deben estar presentes hay que promover el pluralismo en la informaci n y evitar la concentraci n de la propiedad de los medios y que se generen medios p blicos comerciales y comunitarios y que la sociedad pueda optar en la grilla de canales de aire debe haber informaci n local con la cual los ciudadanos de cada parte del pa s se sienta identificado por otra parte los medios estatales por ejemplo deber an ser p blicos y parlamentarios no gubernamentales

7550449 sollten wir aufgrund des bildmaterials bekannte leute mit eindeutigen fakten erwischen die nicht f r ein stadionverbot reichen aber auch nicht dem geb hrenden verhalten eines fans entsprechen werden wir als austria rigoros hausverbote aussprechen

7550453 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7550454 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7550455 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7550456 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7550457 personally i am going to do a prowl to all newspapers regarding the dems giving fl mi full voting rights we all know what a sham that is im also going to state what is going on with the delegates being threatened etc remember the link i posted a couple of months ago and has been reposted elsewhere in the blogs you can publish a letter to all newspapers in the us and all over the world go pumas will someone keep posting the link to the website so those that come on later can see it and put it up on a new thread when and if it becomes available thx
7550458 the obama campaign is doing their best to paper over the deep divisions in their party among the many hillary clinton supporters who do not want barack obama to be president
7550459 we want these voters to know that they still have the choice to vote for a president who is ready in this election and john mccain would welcome their support
7550460 this clearly shows how racist and anti american people such as yourselves are if it works for you its okay but if it is new and innovative and heaven forbid black find away to suppress it
7550461 wome got the vote 88 years ago how much longer until we get the votes counted
7550462 when democracy comes back to the democratic party so will we
7550463 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7550464 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7550465 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7550466 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7550467 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7550468 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7550469 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7550470 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7550471 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7550472 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7550473 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7550474 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

7550500 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7550501 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7550505 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7550506 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7550507 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator

7550513 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7550514 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7550515 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7550525 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7550526 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7550527 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7550528 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

7550536 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7550537 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7550538 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7550539 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7550540 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

7550544 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7550545 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7550546 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

7550549 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7550550 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7550551 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7550552 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7550553 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7550554 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7550555 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7550556 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7550557 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7550558 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7550559 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7550560 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7550561 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7550562 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7550563 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7550564 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7550565 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7550566 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

7550574 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7550575 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7550576 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

7550578 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7550579 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7550580 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7550581 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7550582 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7550583 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

7550585 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7550586 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7550587 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7550588 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7550589 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7550590 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7550591 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7550592 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7550593 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7550594 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7550595 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7550596 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7550597 we provide a professional environment where flexible employment policies make it easy for people to stay with us and a culture that makes them want to stay
7550598 because were a financial services company and our products are intangible our people truly are our most valuable resource

7550659 as a quarterback you know youre one play away from being in there but that turned into three or four games away there were opportunities for me to play but they gave kerry money up front and they felt he was the answer but you get what you pay for and toronto is 3 5 right now

7550670 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
7550671 under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits
7550672 it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime

7550685 we certainly didnt expect to find that reality has a consciousness and is hostile towards certain individuals we just figured mr failures claims of persecution were symptoms of acute paranoia however our study findings definitively prove that existence really does hate his guts big time existence is riding this guys ass poking him with a sharp stick tossing banana peels onto his path dropping cow patties on him from a clear blue sky their relationship is akin to the one between moe and curly in the three stooges make no mistake its definitely personal

7550741 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7550742 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7550743 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system
7550744 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
7550745 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
7550746 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
7550747 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs
7550748 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly

7550756 marcar as delimitaci ns e actuaci ns dentro deses espazos para que todos os cidad ns poidan disfrutar do litoral e polo tanto engadiu a conselleira permitir definir onde podemos baixar eses cincocentos metros porque a situaci n as o permita e onde porque a paisaxe caracter stica ou porque a natureza a nda non est transformada debemos estender a nda mais a protecci n
7550757 este e o momento de ordenar o litoral para decidir onde podemos baixar dos cincocentos onde por ser entorno urbano e como di a lei de costas se pode edificar a vinte metros e onde debemos ampliar a protecci n
7550758 xa que lamentablemente a ausencia de ordenaci n do litoral levou a moitas zonas a unha situaci n e a unha destruci n que creo que ningu n a ve positivamente
7550759 en galicia estamos a tempo de po er en valor a nosa costa e debemos aprender de experiencias negativas doutros sitios xa que non queremos que se repita un modelo coma o do mediterr neo hai que conciliar o progreso econ mico de galicia coa protecci n do noso litoral ese valor patrimonial tan prezado
7550760 que nos permitan desenvolver o que o sentido com n dos galegos di que se pode desenvolver e en qu condici ns

7550812 when i hear these things anything to do with the case i got a picture in my head of her being attacked you put that in your head her being attacked and that 9 000 offer it just beggars belief
7550813 its not my money its not for me its for a baby who was subjected to a horrendous crime and all the money in the world wont make it better but it will help

7550826 the diary isnt orwell at his most polemic it is orwell at his most steady most observant
7550827 hes partly obsessed by the newspapers because of the start of the world war
7550828 the diary is written against this almost traumatized understanding that there is going to have to be a second world war

7550845 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7550846 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7550847 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7550848 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7550849 one neighbor said she heard garcia screaming for 35 minutes but ignored the cries because she thought the victim was drunk
7550850 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7550851 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7550852 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7550853 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7550854 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7550856 art design fashion music they all feed off each other and inspire each other so i
7550857 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7550858 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7550859 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7550860 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7550861 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7550862 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7550863 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7550864 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7550865 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7550866 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7550867 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7550868 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7550869 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7550870 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7550871 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7550872 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7550873 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7550874 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7550875 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7550876 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7550877 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7550878 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7550879 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7550880 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7550881 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7550882 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7550883 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7550884 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7550885 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7550886 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7550887 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7550888 who are open to doing something on the production side
7550889 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7550890 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7550891 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7550892 and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day
7550893 i give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand

7550897 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7550898 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7550899 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7550900 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7550901 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7550902 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7550903 unfortunately i didnt have the best school experience because kids can be very cruel ive been acting all my life
7550904 never really understood those actors that dont want to play villains because i think that if you do a bad ass job playing the villain and people leave the theater or turn off the tv youre getting emotion from them so thats cool
7550905 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7550906 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7550907 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7550908 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7550909 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7550910 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7550911 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7550912 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7550913 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7550914 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7550915 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7550916 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7550917 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7550918 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7550919 you need to tell me about anything that hurts when it starts from now on
7550920 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7550921 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7550922 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7550923 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7550924 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7550925 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7550926 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7550927 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7550928 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7550929 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7550934 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life
7550935 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7550936 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office

7550943 home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7550944 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
7550945 we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
7550946 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7550947 buyers whove been on the sidelines should take a closer look at whats available to them now in terms of financing and incentives

7550955 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7550956 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7550957 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7550958 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7550960 dad says the child of the atheist what happens when we die
7550961 well nothing really we come from nothing and we go to nothing either your mom and i or someone else will put you into the ground and cover you with dirt and the person that we knew as you will just totally and completely cease to exist
7550962 but how can i just come to an end what if i only live until im five years old i wont get to do anything important
7550963 my dear boy five years or five hundred years it doesnt really matter because none of it counts not ultimately anyhow humans are part of a dying species in a dying universe youre an accident little buddy an absolute accident to which we gave a name dont get me wrong we love you and perhaps some day you can even manipulate some other people to love you too but apart from that youre pretty much on your own
7550964 but what are we here for is there any meaning or purpose to all this
7550965 use your brain son how can there be meaning and purpose to something thats an accident reality is you come from nothing and youre headed to nothing just emptiness a void thats all there is son thats not a bad thing son it just is the fact is our life has no meaning no context and absolutely no purpose save the purpose that you pretend to give it pretty cool huh
7550966 but daddy shouldnt i at least try to be a good person
7550967 oh my precious little munchkin good and bad are just subjective words that some people use to describe things that they like or dont like all i know is live good live bad live for yourself live for others none of it matters because the end of the good and the end of the bad the end of people pigs and insects is exactly the same we rot away and become a different form of matter now why dont you run along ive got some useless and pointless things to do
7550968 but dad thats absurd how do you expect me to be happy if life has no meaning context or purpose
7550969 well sweetpea now youre starting to ask whats beginning to feel like a lot of questions first of all i couldnt not make you my genes compel me to reproduce i squirt my semen here and there and everywhere
7550970 while our efforts in congress have helped reduce the number of homegrown meth labs these labs still present an incredible danger to law enforcement officers who raid them they are an environmental nightmare and most importantly theyre an unbelievable hazard to kids
7550971 weve got to help state and local authorities by providing them with the necessary training education and resources to deal with this disturbing and destructive trend meth production and use is like a balloon clamp down on one side and the other side swells we need to meet this challenge with an approach that addresses both the supply and the demand
7550972 the women and men fighting this war on terror overseas should not have to return to find their neighborhoods overrun with criminals and meth labs we must be able to protect our citizens at home while also protecting our nation overseas our service people and our nation deserve better as we combat terrorism around the world fighting crime in our own backyards should not take a back seat but a report recently released by the fbi shows it has

7550984 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7550985 our primary responsibility and need at this stage has been to remove the recalled products from the market weve provided the list of products and weve been in direct contact and have talked with every single one of the customers and distributors that have received and distributed that product
7550986 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7550987 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7550988 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7550989 but once we were aware of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7550990 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7550995 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
7550996 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7550997 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7550998 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7551001 over time it kept getting higher and higher until finally a news agency in the u k called him and asked to use the photo and story then it just blew up

7551020 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7551021 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7551022 in less than 100 years the georgian military has three times carried out genocide against the ossetian people why are they killing us because we simply want to live as equals with all the other nations
7551023 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7551024 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7551025 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7551026 according to our information south ossetian militias want to take this village our forces got the order not to shoot but if ossetians start shooting they will have to return fire
7551027 we believe that the ossetians are preparing a provocation there
7551028 about three hours ago georgian policemen occupied the village of mosabruni they told locals to leave straight away villagers are leaving on foot

7551124 there is no way that you can send players to pakistan amidst reports from security experts indicating that it would be unsafe to do so

7551132 no one goes into a restaurant and requests a plate of food please people do not simply ask for a glass of wine without specifying at the very least whether they fancy red or white dry or sweet perhaps sparkling or still beer is by far the more extensively consumed but less adequately honoured in a small way i want to help put right that injustice
7551133 we have a great mixture of some older guys with shonn coming back and being around now for his third year
7551134 we have a great mix of some older guys and some younger guys who have stepped in and done a great job most notably nate guillory has really improved since the spring
7551135 overall im very pleased with the way theyve worked and the attitude that they come out to practice with every day
7551136 going into the first game shonn and paki have kind of jumped out a little bit theyre doing a great job and theyre doing a great job being leaders
7551137 jordan has been kind of banged up a little bit and working his way through it and i think hell be healthy for that first game has had a pretty good camp
7551138 both danny and trent have come in and really done a great job
7551139 i think danny is tremendously improved since the spring and trent has come in and done a good job pushing danny for the job that job right now has not been decided it may be something that goes through the season i dont know but as of right now at this moment we havent made a decision there

7551141 you know what if i sit here and do that all summer i think id drive myself nuts until training camp
7551142 the best thing for me to do is take it day by day and focus on my training
7551143 but if i have to go back to the american league i just have to find a way to motivate myself to keep working hard and keep pushing i have come too far and have worked too hard that if it doesnt go my way this year it would be wrong to just not give the same effort
7551144 i talked to dale and he still wants me to be their guy
7551145 theyre not giving up on me just because that deal with huet happened
7551146 if he wasnt talking to me i think it would be a totally different situation
7551147 him letting me know that they still want me that theyre still trying to find room for me it gives me a little bit of extra motivation
7551148 i really think hes a heck of a goalie we like his growth and the like the way he plays hes had a good couple of solid years in a row we have high hopes for him
7551149 i have been playing in the ahl for three pretty solid years
7551150 it was a lot of games down there i feel that im ready to move on and move up and get challenged up here
7551151 everybody wants to make the nhl at 20 and play forever but it doesnt always work out that way some guys have a longer road and you just have to keep plugging away and hope your opportunity comes earlier than later
7551152 we feel he can play some valuable minutes this year
7551153 i have to come into camp and prove to them that im ready
7551154 please monitor yourself and remember that drinks may go to your head faster than youre used to in new york

7551189 but the biggest concern for tim gullikson his coach was my attitude on the court i tended to slump and slouch especially when things werent going my way anyone can play tennis when hes firing on all cylinders the challenge is to play well enough to win when youre not at your best theres a sneering inner judge in all of us and a big part of being successful is tuning him out instead of listening to that judge when he says youre lousy or should pack it in because youre tired and theres always next week thats when you need to suck it up and act like a man hang on fight on show the pride of a champion

7551198 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen makes this particularly rare
7551199 the russian gangs who specialize in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7551200 continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information

7551202 i was driving back from scotland on saturday night when the headline act at glastonbury came out shouting and swearing i caught it on the radio it was hard to avoid on the radio actually glastonbury was everywhere the bbc was handing it out like cake at christmas like you were weird if you didnt want a piece i had been listening to the gallop from william tell all the way from gairloch to inverness trying to learn exactly how it goes but it was making me drive too fast it sounded like the glastonbury audience was having a good time but jay z couldnt follow rossini for chops and i suddenly realised i was six shades happier heading for home on my own in the people carrier than i would have been standing on stage in shepton wotsit

7551219 chris hoy is entitled to his own opinion and he has clearly done a fantastic job at the olympic games but i think a scottish team is still important and i would support the idea
7551220 people have to look at what level they want to represent their country at
7551221 before there are any discussions of scotland going it alone at the olympics he would have to look at the facilities and the resources that have been put into scotland in the first place
7551222 at the moment we dont have an international facility for cycling and we dont have the coaching structures in place in fact we dont have anything in place so the whole idea is ridiculous
7551223 i wouldnt have three gold medals hanging round my neck if i wasnt part of the british athletic team im a scottish athlete in a british team and im proud to be a british athlete
7551224 given the choice of saving meadowbank or getting a knighthood hed choose meadowbank in a flash it means so much to him
7551225 the facility has a great international reputation if you lose meadowbank you lose the reputation as well and that will be extremely sad
7551226 the velodrome needs a little tlc but it is loved and my pupils can see the facility is good enough to take them to the top
7551227 i would love to be able to take more groups of pupils there and introduce them to the sport
7551228 we think chris would be great as the next face of scotts porage oats
7551229 he is strong and healthy good looking and a scottish hero hes the perfect icon its not at boardroom level yet but were certainly keen to get him signed up if hes interested
7551230 chris is a dream hes an outstanding athlete it will be very easy for him to earn 1million every year for the next four years
7551231 i had to call and call and call just like anybody else
7551232 i had to call several times before i got anybody
7551233 im glad she got help to save her house im not mad at that im upset that the same people wouldnt help me and they denied it was going on
7551234 i had prisoners laughing at me when i approached them about it they knew what was going on it was hilarious to them
7551235 we had a resource that we could help somebody with i made a judgment that it was the right thing to do

7551237 la justicia tiene que actuar para que los terroristas no campen a sus anchas
7551238 estamos hablando del caso de una persona que deber a estar en la c rcel y en este momento no lo est y sigue defendiendo el terrorismo y actuando como un terrorista amenazando de muerte a la gente
7551239 es normal q ue la fiscal a sea dura y que un juez le cite a declarar al supuesto amenazador de una concejala del pp y a arrue para que confirme su declaraci n
7551240 cuando la justicia act a con normalidad salen reforzadas las v ctimas y mejor defendida la libertad

7551255 in my perspective its a great and special week for us
7551256 its like all the hard work paid off unexpected hard work well we proved it once when we had the 2006 flood in the shop we proved it another time when we had the fire on the hauler so just to prove that those guys they keep these cars in fantastic shape and for the drivers to not even notice i didnt notice actually for me it was a great car
7551257 i enjoyed probably about saturday and sunday of this week

7551266 california will give barack obama and joe biden the biggest victory in the history of our country the most votes ever for a presidential candidate are you ready to come together in unity and support barack obama and joe biden i bring this up because reporters ask me all day about this but as we gather here remember its not just about us and what our feelings are about the campaigns its about the hopes aspirations and challenges of the american people and they are looking to us to come out of this convention with unity organized and focused to take this country in a new direction we owe them that this is about our country
7551267 if people want to talk about drilling offshore dont come around california with that kind of talk lets talk about the connection between oil which belongs to the people and the record profits from the oil companies and how they take it out of the ground with no royalties in california
7551268 because obamas popularity is declining right now and they might have something to do with it

7551271 i won the james f hornback ethical humanist of the year in 2007
7551272 i think its more about the ride than the outcome theyre having a good time
7551273 det er ironisk ment titlen p min blog det er jo netop fordi jeg ikke skriver om noget i virkeligheden er det ren overflade der er intet dybt i mine indl g
7551274 jeg begyndte at blogge som en form for terapi det var en sv r tid for mig en midtvejskrise kan man vel kalde det jeg stillede mig selv nogle af livets store sp rgsm l hvad vil jeg med mit liv er jeg hvor jeg nsker at v re forn gter jeg en side af mig selv osv jeg er grafisk designer af profession og har et stort behov for kreativitet i mit liv men i stedet arbejdede jeg med noget helt andet blogging blev min m de at udtrykke mig kreativt p og samtidig se ind i mig selv
7551275 i begyndelsen skrev jeg til mig selv og kun til mig selv det var min personlige dagbog kun nogle f venner vidste at jeg bloggede og jeg regnede egentlig ikke med at de l ste med jeg kunne ikke se hvorfor det skulle v re interessant for andre men en dag tjekkede jeg bes gstallet p min blog og det ndrede alt jeg opdagede at der var folk der overhovedet ikke kendte mig der l ste mine indl g fra den dag f lte jeg et ansvar for hvad jeg skrev man kan vel kalde det forf ngelighed et slags ego trip men det ndrede min weblog fuldst ndig
7551276 jeg begyndte at have et bredere udsyn end min egen lille verden jeg begyndte at skrive om folk jeg kendte som inspirerede mig eller folk jeg beundrede som fx asumta en kenyansk kvinde med hiv eller ibrahim wafula en cykelrytter der kun har et ben jeg ville og vil inspirere folk
7551277 efter urolighederne i k lvandet p valget sidste r skrev jeg ikke om voldsudgydelserne det var der s mange andre der gjorde i stedet skrev jeg om de tilf lde hvor folk hjalp hinanden
7551278 men selvf lgelig kunne jeg ikke lade v re med at deltage i diskussionen om hvad der skete og hvorfor det skete jeg pr ver ikke at skrive om politik men det er sv rt politik har v ret rsag til s mange ting der er g et galt her i kenya
7551279 det vigtigste for mig er at weblogs er velskrevne og at de formidler almindelige menneskers tanker om verden omkring dem jeg gider ikke l se fagblogs eller blogs skrevet af kendte mennesker det vigtigste for mig er mennesket bag jeg bes ger regelm ssigt i dance the internet af baz vi er allesammen i et l st netv rk vi kender ikke hinanden men vi kommenterer hinandens blogindl g roser og opmuntrer hinanden n r vi l ser noget vi synes er godt
7551280 blogging er jo helt anderledes end traditionelle medier for mig er det den r upolerede virkelighed fordi blogging er hurtigt nedf ldede tanker fra almindelige mennesker de fleste blogs s ger ikke sensationen men n jes med at kommentere hverdagen
7551281 og s er der kommentarerne n r folk skriver p min blog og sp rger om der ikke snart kommer et nyt indl g eller om jeg er ok siden de ikke har set noget nyt fra mig i lang tid s f ler jeg mig n rmest forpligtet til at skrive

7551299 it is critical that all new yorkers do their part to protect the states water resources
7551300 while recognizing that the presence of pharmaceuticals in the water is a multi faceted issue with no single solution or easy technological fix all of us need to take precautionary action on the things we can affect immediately
7551301 this is an emerging environmental issue and the consequences are not yet clear
7551302 new yorkers can help out by not flushing unused drugs and instead using alternate disposal methods we recognize that were now asking residents to change something that has been standard practice for years but we know everyone wants to protect new yorks water quality and public health

7551310 one flashpoint is the assigned speech topic for former president bill clinton who is scheduled to speak wednesday night when the convention theme is securing americas future the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas
7551311 this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7551312 team continues to act like she and bill clinton hold leverage
7551313 on this one my hunch is politico is right i recall that in 2000 al gore aides told me they had no more delicate convention task than telling the clintons that they wanted them to make an appearance and leave
7551314 if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his own family first

7551317 in srebrenica at the time we had to protect ourselves from the bosnian muslims rather than protect the muslims from the serbs
7551318 we talked about their possible testimony they stressed that the serbs did not commit war crimes against the muslim civilians when they were passing through several dozen of their villages in srebrenica municipality the dutch soldiers were securing they came over at their own expense and said they will testify and invite more of their fellow soldiers to testify too they left belgrade on thursday
7551319 they told me they came here in apprehension and worried because they expected to be hated in serbia just like back home they said in srebrenica at the time they had to protect themselves from the muslims rather than protect muslims from the serbs serb army according to them was helping the muslim women and their children bringing them food and water

7551333 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7551334 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7551335 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7551349 the power of probabilistic thinking to override our intuitive sense of numbers or what i call folk numeracy in parallel with my previous columns on folk science august 2006 and folk medicine august 2008 and with my book on folk economics the mind of the market folk numeracy is our natural tendency to misperceive and miscalculate probabilities to think anecdotally instead of statistically and to focus on and remember short term trends and small number runs we notice a short stretch of cool days and ignore the long term global warming trend

7551384 sen barack obamas pledge to supporters that they would be the first to know his running mate turned out to be a savvy but unworkable communications strategy
7551385 michael silberman a partner at online communications firm echoditto said the campaign gambled when they made such a high stakes promise and find themselves in a precarious situation where they could risk a great deal of trust with supporters
7551386 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered

7551390 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7551391 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7551392 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression of the thirties and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7551393 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7551394 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better

7551396 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year

7551470 were seeing much larger scale fraud and criminal behavior that has an international aspect to it
7551471 were also seeing a larger amount of espionage both industrial espionage and nationally funded espionage so its increasingly vital that global leaders take these threats seriously put some resources into fighting cybercrime and cooperate with one another
7551472 as were heading into what may be a recession this is an area that should be of concern because it affects costs that are passed on to consumers
7551473 it would be unlikely to bring the united states to a halt but it could certainly be damaging

7551477 there is still a lot we need to know about e coli to completely eliminate it therefore beef safety research continues to be one of the industrys highest priorities we believe and science proves that one of the best ways to combat foodborne pathogens like e coli o157 h7 is with validated interventions
7551478 bifscos experts believe in a multiple hurdle approach to beef safety and our goal is to have 100 per cent of beef packing plants use one or more of the safety interventions the beef industry under the leadership of bifsco has researched implemented and validated
7551479 the optimal system of food safety assurance relies on a food safety network that extends from farm to consumer
7551480 open communication and information sharing like this happens frequently and stimulates technology and knowledge adoption which is an essential part of the continual improvement of beef safety systems

7551491 rightly or mistakenly theres a suspicion that selected banks will announce another round of write offs
7551492 second banks are coming to grips with the reality of the global slowdown the slowdown suggests reduced revenue for banks which would further hurt already strained balance sheets and make banks more reluctant to lend
7551493 only after banks become confident in those they are lending to so long as banks believe some in their sector may be hiding losses the bias will be toward pulling back lending activity and thats reflected in higher rates
7551494 its a bit crazy just looking out of the window of the plane and looking at everyone
7551495 its always good to come back as part of the team people are upset at how theyve performed but youve got to share in everybodys success
7551496 we were looking out of the windows and everyone at heathrow was waving flags
7551497 its just been great it really has i think im going to have a few days off then i will be back to hard training
7551498 bueno dalia lleg el d a lleg el momento vamos a dar lo mejor que s se puede buscar una medalla
7551499 if the economy wasnt this way i wouldve gotten a job in a short period of time and it wouldve stopped the progression of everything else that happened
7551500 were a very small operation and we have very limited funding
7551501 we have never had a may june july and august where we have not only every bed that we have in the state occupied but we have waiting lists
7551502 and in some places we have waiting lists of eight to 10 people for a bed a bed
7551503 by the number of applications were seeing the need is greater and we do attribute that to the fact that they have no money people are living in cars people are sleeping on couches and that gets old
7551504 this is the first summer ive spent where almost every day we are full
7551505 the only reason i have anything open today is i had a family relocate and two men moved out i guarantee by tomorrow itll be full again
7551506 its easy to bounce back when you have one thing go wrong
7551507 said spader who has never lived in a shelter until now
7551508 but then when you lose your job and then you lose shelter and then you lose transportation its very very difficult its a cycle you cant get a job if you cant get there but you cant get a car if you dont have a job
7551509 its much more difficult for individuals grappling with emotional programs to compete successfully in the economic arena
7551510 its harder for them to focus on issues of livelihood when they are depressed they cant sleep or theyre drinking too much
7551511 everywhere across the country people are dealing with veterans in crisis and we have to assume that this is going to eventually impact us here
7551512 we were a resource to veterans struggling with addiction because they could utilize our shelter while they were dealing with this
7551513 post implementation of the city councils requirements we will be required to bar them
7551514 its disgraceful that people who served their country come home to live on the streets
7551515 my fear is thats going to grow with the economy this way
7551516 right now there are not a whole lot of good employment opportunities out there
7551517 im not just going to be on a downhill spiral until life ends
7551518 i feel that everything happens for a reason i always had a caring heart and i wanted to help people but sometimes i would look at them and say why dont they just get a job but now i understand that sometimes you cant just get a job
7551519 when you walk into here and see what youre going to be able to do you cant help but get excited
7551520 quality health care close to home for our veterans is critical
7551521 this new facility will bring state of the art equipment and procedures to the greater pensacola area and will lessen the requirement for veterans to make long trips for their medical care
7551522 local veterans have been saying for a number of years that the current clinic is undersized for the number of visitors they have
7551523 this new facility quadruples the size of the old clinic
7551524 there are a lot of vets around the country that have never experienced a new facility but in florida because of the growth weve been very fortunate to get a lot of dollars for facilities
7551525 were shoulder to shoulder with the navy working together to do whats best for the vets
7551526 we want them to feel like this is home like this is a good place to come get their care
7551527 we did that for the veterans it helps guide them through the building and it also reminds them who they are and what they used to do
7551528 its been an extremely rewarding experience because as far as we are concerned our patients are no 1

7551531 it is a stain on this nations honor that the department of veterans affairs has become a deadlier and more difficult adversary to the american veteran than any they have ever faced on a battlefield
7551532 the concept that agent orange and its effects stopped dead in its tracks at the shoreline is simply too illogical and too ludicrous to accept
7551533 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
7551534 i want them to be held accountable for this to prevent this from happening to someone else
7551535 nothing could have saved joe but the care there was hateful and incompetent
7551536 the study has very little to do with their diagnosis and it is not consistent with what occurred
7551537 dr bergmann made it very clear to us that the benefit of signing up for the study would be that she would develop an individual profile of joe that would help them to arrive at a diagnosis faster
7551538 he was released because his work up was complete we did all the tests we could have done
7551539 he was in need of hospice care and that is what castle point provides
7551540 wasnt concerned about my day to day life he wasnt concerned with my wartime experiences he wasnt concerned about if i was going to make it home safely after the appointment
7551541 it is only when there is no therapy or the therapy that is available is of doubtful utility that someone can be recruited to research
7551542 every researcher and every institution that does research must be sure to make an accurate diagnosis of a patient to then offer them whatever therapy is available at the institution to give them all their options in terms of treatment anywhere else and then and only then to pursue the possibility of trying something new in a research study
7551543 no one should ever be penalized for failing to volunteer for a study ever
7551544 the goal of any medical encounter must be first and foremost to provide the latest and best care when care is available
7551545 the chance to participate as a subject in research has to take a secondary role to receiving care as a patient
7551546 the research team is completely independent of the clinical team and the clinical team has priority and determines if a person is approachable
7551547 you come to a hospital in critical need and you want care even if you are not cured and instead they say they are going to observe the degeneration and death

7551551 who decides what the price band should be when companies like vodafone essar and bharti airtel can have a price band of around rs 800 900 how come the countrys number one telecom company is priced so low
7551552 the amount will go to the government and this might not necessarily be used for bsnls expansion
7551553 we have been assured by the telecom minister that the government will not proceed without the trade unions consent namboodri said
7551554 annex 1 section 5 provides that agricultural products shall not be eligible for any preferential treatment under the sadc protocol on trade
7551555 as no adjustment strategies have been developed or implemented in anticipation of the inevitable elimination of tariffs under the sadc protocol on trade it is anticipated that the elimination of tariffs and in particular the elimination of botswanas import permit system under the control of goods act will adversely of effect all eight of our agricultural commodity value chains cvcs including beef dairy small stock pigs poultry ostrich grains and horticulture
7551556 we are very happy that the mine decided to do this for the children because right now they do not have a place where their meals are prepared

7551601 its due to a combination of scientists looking more and more pollution
7551602 thats enough food to feed half the blue crab harvest for a year
7551603 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7551604 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7551605 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7551606 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7551607 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7551608 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7551609 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7551610 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7551611 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster

7551621 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7551622 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7551623 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7551624 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7551625 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7551626 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7551627 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7551628 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7551629 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7551630 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7551631 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7551632 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7551633 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it

7551639 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7551640 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7551641 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7551642 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7551643 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7551644 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7551645 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7551646 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series

7551648 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

7551660 ma secondo te mi fa male se fumo cn il mal di gola nn ho parlato al mio medico di cose cos intime
7551661 ohhh ma questo nome peggio della capanna dello zio tom

7551663 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7551664 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7551665 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7551666 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
7551667 the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7551668 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7551669 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7551670 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7551671 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7551672 esto no va al cne esto va a estar en manos de los colegios profesionales y estamos en la obligaci n de garantizar a la colectividad que no tenga miedo de firmar
7551673 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7551674 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7551675 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7551676 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7551677 oh how i wish i could do it all again
7551678 when i invited a friend round to mums house for tea he engaged her in conversation about mikhail gorbachev quick as a flash she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7551679 it took us all time to realize that she couldnt remember a newspaper headline she had just read or what shed had for breakfast that morning
7551680 he avoided driving up whitehall because as their car passed downing street she would look up wondering why they hadnt turned in
7551681 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7551682 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7551683 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7551684 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7551685 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts to reduce theirs
7551686 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7551687 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7551688 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7551689 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7551690 in the brief time he held his position we spoke almost daily he learned so much and did so much to make arab americans and american muslims feel included in the campaign
7551691 manji a practicing muslim brings real insight to her subject
7551692 manji is a fresh new and intriguing voice of islamic reform
7551693 that bin laden spends so much time in caves like the meditating prophet did
7551694 americans having been more harmed by americans than non americans
7551695 mazen asbahi has just resigned i cant say im disheartened hed been embraced by groups like the muslim public affairs council and the islamic society of north america renowned for their conservative politics and moderate double speak
7551696 the unilateral and imprecise operation which included both ground and air strikes in azizabad district caused a tragic incident claiming 89 civilian lives including women and children
7551697 afghans will not need the presence of foreign troops and democracy if they continue to kill innocent civilians
7551698 they should also be equipped with audible announcement facilities for the blind and clear signage for the deaf
7551699 we want facilities that are accessible not only for us but also for the elderly
7551700 we only want the decision makers to make the right decision that would make our lives easier

7551710 siempre ha habido escritores j venes solo que con el desarrollo de nuevas editoriales ahora pueden publicar hay movimientos que empezaron en los ochenta dentro de la universidad y reci n se est n lanzando ahora
7551711 es beneficioso que un escritor comience a mostrar su obra desde joven porque eso le permite encontrar un lineamiento de lo que busca desarrollar en el futuro
7551712 promocionar j venes valores y vincularlos a la universidad es algo positivo porque habla de que hay una formaci n acad mica del escritor
7551713 el romanticismo de este tipo de trabajos a veces no permite medir los riesgos que se asumen con cada publicaci n
7551714 ambas tendencias tienen que combinarse para que salga un resultado que apueste por cosas nuevas y que no se quede en los est ndares pero que adem s tenga la dosis de sostenibilidad que necesita la organizaci n de una empresa tener en cuenta que si arriesgas toda la plata que posees te puede ir bastante mal
7551715 es genial tras un mal resultado en hungr a la fecha pasada llegar a un nuevo circuito y ganar es fant stico es m s de lo que esper bamos
7551716 cuando el avi n se incendi una de sus puertas estaba bloqueada y todos se apresuraron hacia la otra puerta

7551718 despeg y report un problema t cnico y trat de regresar al aeropuerto

7551738 el senador obama tuvo una gran conversaci n esta semana con la senadora clinton as como con el ex presidente bill clinton todos a bordo y los medios van a enloquecer cuando salgamos unidos de esta convenci n
7551739 la campa a del senador obama es cada vez m s negativa
7551740 ella gan millones de votos pero no es la candidata a la vicepresidencia por qu por decir la verdad
7551741 ella ha dicho repetidamente que barack obama y ella comparten el mismo deseo de cambiar la direcci n del pa s sac ndonos de iraq y ampliando el acceso a seguros de salud john mccain no ha dicho eso es curioso c mo estos comentarios no aparecen en el anuncio

7551746 doris tuvo una cercan a y a la vez una distancia muy marcada con el poder porque su vida en verdad fue la calle la esquina del movimiento
7551747 con el alejamiento de doris gibson parece cerrarse un cap tulo y una hermosa y gran leyenda de nuestro pa s hay que agradecerle por haber inspirado a este hijo suyo que es caretas por el camino de la libertad de la independencia cr tica y sobre todo del combate a las dictaduras y de la abominaci n a la tiran a quienes hemos ejercido el poder y lo ejercemos podemos dar cuenta del dardo ir nico permanente de su revista pero siempre estaremos a su lado porque sabemos que fue una adversaria leal y al mismo tiempo defensora de la libertad
7551748 doris sin duda fue un torbellino de impulsos que cre no solo la revista sino ese tono siempre alturado pero irreverente punzante pero inteligente para hacer periodismo
7551749 doris fue una mujer de trabajo de lucha con una vida muy dif cil en alg n momento pero que la convirti en algo espl ndido
7551750 est pobremente equipado para defenderse contra un grupo terrorista que ataque con armas nucleares biol gicas o qu micas

7551777 se ven a trabajando desde hace mucho tiempo para conseguir esto
7551778 le ganamos a brasil hicimos muchos goles y lo importante es que hemos ganado la medalla dorada por eso estoy contento porque el grupo siempre estuvo unido
7551779 siempre es importante ganar con la selecci n ven amos de caer en dos finales y necesit bamos darle una alegr a a nuestra gente y a nosotros mismos
7551780 me enter reci n de la lesi n de mart n y siento una gran pena por lo que le est pasando
7551781 fuimos inteligentes a la hora de jugar merecedores de este torneo porque fuimos superiores a todos y el equipo jug muy bien en todas las l neas
7551782 que l con tantas obligaciones que tiene haya podido estar con nosotros fue muy importante signific algo muy lindo para todos as que la medalla dorada tambi n se la dedicamos a diego
7551783 la verdad que todo esto que estoy viviendo me parece algo incre ble por todo lo que me pas en estos ltimos meses jugar en la primera de boca estar en la selecci n ganar una medalla dorada y encima a punto de ir jugar al f tbol europeo es algo incre ble
7551784 a ten minute teaser containing footage from puma pac and brad mays new political documentary still being shot around america at this juncture the focus is on malfeasance during the texas primary it should be pointed out that were still loading all the footage weve shot up to now into the editing system and that production will continue through the election and possibly beyond so what we intend to do is change this teaser on a weekly basis

7551798 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

7551806 carnival should not be used as an instrument of hatred any kind of racism and clear trivialisation of barbaric and unjustified acts against minorities
7551807 this an extremely serious work and people think were mocking

7551809 do all you can in the time you have with what you have in the place you are
7551810 and if you ask anyone that is in my personal life or professional life im almost a food pusher
7551811 you know i kind of like dont let people leave my home or my studio without either eating or without taking a little goody bag for the car or something
7551812 so i am very in support of healthy women and healthy bodies in fact every woman that i work with at this point in my life is a very healthy woman with a very kind of curvy healthy athletic body

7551817 most guitars are made in factories populated by normal people and not some peculiar race of evil guitar wizard high priests
7551818 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7551819 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
7551820 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
7551821 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either
7551822 were not actually looking at this project being built in probably three to five years
7551823 first things first is we have to test the wind
7551824 we try not to get too excited about a project until you have good wind data
7551825 we have been looking investigating potential projects in that area
7551826 at best at this point it would be the very early stages of development
7551827 we cant really say but weve had some fruitful discussions
7551828 if its under 105 megawatts and its in a resource zone you would apply at the county for a conditional use permit
7551829 theres a lot of healthy competition in the wind energy field in general
7551830 the report was received and reviewed by the planning board chairman and the town supervisor due to the technical nature of the report it was sent back to our consultant and the consultant has been asked to provide clarifications to assist the planning board to understand the consultants recommendations
7551831 once the planning board has a chance to review it
7551832 its their report when it comes back and well go from there
7551833 we had no financial involvement really but i expect well see it once it comes back in its completed form its understandable
7551834 i think they just didnt want to accept what the residents had to say
7551835 out in the rural north country the noise is going to be very similar
7551836 they used a similar number of sites similar measuring times
7551837 we recommend that the noise data be considered irrespective of wind speed
7551838 it is recommended that the authors comment on this and present low frequency sound data for the turbine design to be installed
7551839 it is true that low frequency sound produced by wind turbine blade passage can be in a sense amplified inside building spaces because of standing wave effects
7551840 you have to infer from toccis report that its gotta be redone
7551841 its on the back burner because of the suspension of the application
7551842 the planning board has clearly indicated as has the town board that we will look at all the information provided by the applicant for the portions of seqr and address them based on what needs to be addressed based on that information at one time
7551843 if the whole changing of our law depends on this report then lets move on with this
7551844 we can make a change but it would be arbitrary
7551845 it would be best to make any changes with good information
7551846 the soil and subsoil conditions comprise of peat underlain with clay the interface of such permeable and impermeable soils could in my opinion under certain conditions possibly be conducive to large scale soil movement
7551847 this is a lethal blow to the feale this is the worst kind of pollution

7551862 we the undersigned pledge not to elect another globalist for president
7551863 regarding illegal and legal immigration both barack obama and john mccain support the third world invasion of the united states and thus are guilty of treason
7551864 both barack obama and john mccain advocate ruinous free trade agreements which undermine our economy
7551865 both barack obama and john mccain are interventionists the former supporting war in darfur the latter in iraq and iran the transformation of the middle east or anywhere else to liberal democracy is wilsonian internationalism not conservatism
7551866 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7551867 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7551868 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7551869 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7551870 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7551871 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7551872 biden has made his iraq dismemberment plan the centerpiece of his 2008 candidacy
7551873 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president i mean it i know john doesnt like me saying it but the truth of the matter is it is
7551874 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain
7551875 but i will not i categorically will not do it
7551876 but i think it is a reflection of the desire of this country and the desire of people in both parties to want to see this god awful vicious rift that exists in the nation healed and john and john could go a long way to heal that rift
7551877 i think the single most important thing that john kerry has to do is to say that makes sense that guy could be president or that woman could be president i think thats the single most important thing for people when he or she is announced say that person could be president
7551878 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion he added
7551879 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7551880 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter
7551881 intended for national purposes such as public prayer thanksgiving funeral orations etc and assigned to the special use of no particular sect of denomination but equally open to all
7551882 to recommend to the people of the united states a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of almighty god especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness

7551888 it is clear that the irish people said no and that verdict must be respected
7551889 the government must clearly make changes in order for any progress to be made whether through referendum or any other means
7551890 the fundamental concerns of the irish people cannot be brazenly ignored by dick roche brian cowen or anyone else on the government benches
7551891 it is only three months since the irish people voted to reject the treaty and politicians have to respect the verdict of the electorate
7551892 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
7551893 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on june 12
7551894 indeed minister roches comments may simply have the effect of driving even more people into the no camp
7551895 minister roches comments are yet another example of a government without a plan to tackle the political reality that the lisbon treaty is finished
7551896 there is no political crisis as minister roche has suggested
7551897 there is simply a political task to be dealt with
7551898 the irish people like the french and dutch before them have rejected this treaty a new deal now needs to be negotiated
7551899 dick roche insisted during the campaign there would be no second referendum that this was it and this was the choice the people had to make
7551900 recent polls have showed that if there was another referendum the no vote would be even bigger
7551901 i think it is very very clear that the people have said no and the irish government needs to stand up to its european counterparts

7551913 should not the stronger christian perpetually abstain from wine at all times and in all places since there is always the potential of causing a weak brother to stumble
7551914 god not only provides for mens necessity but in his goodness he deals still more bountifully with them by cheering their hearts with wine and oil nature would certainly be satisfied with water to drink and therefore the addition of wine is owing to gods superabundant liberality
7551915 do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused

7551926 saya merasa yakin dan positif kita mempunyai peluang untuk menang
7551927 saya sangsi sama ada beliau boleh baca kitab feqah atau tidak apabila kita mengeluarkan fatwa yang berkaitan dengan soal hukum kita seolah olah bercakap bagi pihak allah
7551928 jadi kita perlu bercakap dengan ilmu dan sesiapa yang mengeluarkan fatwa tanpa merujuk sebarang kitab yang berkaitan maka akan menerima siksaan dari allah di neraka
7551929 kenyataan beliau yang mengatakan bahawa sumpah itu perlu dilakukan setelah selesai proses mahkamah adalah tidak betul
7551930 ini tiada kaitan dengan mahkamah kerana sumpah yang dilakukan mohd saiful ialah atas pilihan beliau sendri tanpa arahan mana mana pihak
7551931 sumpah sah dilakukan oleh mana mana individu dengan pilihannya sendiri manakala perkara yang digunakan untuk bersumpah ialah hanya dengan menyebut nama allah
7551932 berdasarkan kitab ini ada menyebut kita boleh bersumpah selepas solat asar pada hari jumaat di dalam masjid disisi mimbar atau meriba al quran dan meletakkan tangan diatasnya
7551933 kebetulan dia bertugas pada hari itu jadi tidak mustahil pegawai atasan masjid mengarahkan beliau untuk turut sama dalam upacara tersebut bagi membuat laporan mengenai apa yang berlaku itu perkara biasa
7551934 saya juga bimbang dengan tindakan imam tersebut ramlang yang mengatakan sumpah itu tidak sah dan tidak mengikut syarak

7551955 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7551956 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7551957 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7552168 the implications of the propaganda model are quite clear in the absence of an independent press free from direct and indirect manipulation by powerful economic interests on one hand and government entities on the other the prospects for democratic self governance are slim to none

7552170 briefly stated the propaganda model identifies five factors ownership advertising sourcing flak and anticommunist ideology that act as filters through which information is processed by news workers and organizations in turn these filters affect how news stories are selected and framed for presentation to the american public

7552342 essas duas linhas acabam de incorporar importantes novidades que t m como objetivo oferecer op es diferenciadas para os consumidores dentro do segmento
7552343 propusemos dar continuidade s negocia es dentro do grupo de trabalho para a ades o omc mas informar os parceiros sobre a necessidade de sair de alguns acordos que atualmente contradizem os interesses da r ssia
7552344 ao mesmo tempo nossa economia e algumas de suas ramifica es como a agricultura representam um peso bastante grande
7552345 independentemente do resultado esse julgamento vai balizar crit rios para demarca o e a participa o dos estados nesse processo esse julgamento vai ser rico nesse tipo de orienta o
7552346 se o supremo fixar que a demarca o deve ser setorizada por ilhas evidentemente se estender a todo o territ rio nacional

7552348 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7552349 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7552350 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7552351 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7552352 we just wanted to tell you look like a real life doll
7552353 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks
7552354 surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nations wealth
7552355 the cost of health care continues to be a real and pressing concern
7552356 making sure we are paying for high quality health care services not just the number of services provided is just one of the most critical issues facing the american public and the federal government now and in the future
7552357 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7552358 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7552359 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7552360 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
7552361 combining two different sources of data has the tendency to increase your false positive rate or your false negative rate
7552362 if youre looking for burglars in a run down district where 50 per cent of men have a criminal conviction you may find plenty but if youre trying to find terrorists among airline passengers where they are extremely rare then almost all your hits will be false
7552363 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists
7552364 now in 2008 these very characteristics are presented as value added selling points in the company advertisement of its product
7552365 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown
7552366 more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
7552367 we already had a meeting with senator clinton and its the understanding that we will be released to obama
7552368 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7552369 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7552370 the arizona delegation is split fifty fifty half obama half clinton
7552371 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7552372 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7552373 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7552374 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7552375 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7552376 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7552377 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7552378 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7552379 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7552380 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7552381 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7552382 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7552383 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7552384 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7552385 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7552386 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7552387 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7552388 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7552389 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7552390 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7552391 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7552392 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56
7552393 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7552394 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7552395 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7552396 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7552397 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7552398 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7552399 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7552400 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7552401 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7552402 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7552403 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7552404 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7552405 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7552406 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7552407 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7552408 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7552409 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7552410 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7552411 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7552412 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7552413 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7552414 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7552415 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7552416 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
7552417 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition

7552419 intimately related to the control over energy pipeline and transportation corridors and cites evidence that the georgian august 7 attack was carefully planned in high level consultations between us and nato officials

7552421 silk road strategy the trans eurasian security system as an essential building block of post cold war us foreign policy
7552422 an energy and transport corridor network linking western europe to central asia and eventually to the far east

7552427 as soon as she woke up from surgery she felt around to make sure they were sitting upright and that her nipples were in the right place
7552428 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates

7552553 know that she did not hesitate in confronting the infidels and tyranny we pray to god that you follow her in gods course we inform you umm omar that this letter is very confidential
7552554 i cannot read so why would he send this to me
7552555 we do see certain members of cells attempting to persuade women specifically in many cases wives of those who have been killed as terrorists conduct suicide operations
7552556 we received intelligence that this family was dealing with al qaeda and other criminals this letter is from abu dawood he is the one in charge of recruiting female suicide bombers
7552557 the psychological pressures of the security situation that we used to have in diyala the systematic killing especially in some parts of baquba where the governments forces presence was weak allowed the insurgents to use religion to exploit women
7552558 this is a red line so they take advantage of this weakness in iraqi society
7552559 das w re sonst eine sehr schwierige kritische situation mit blick auf die territoriale integrit t georgiens

7552563 sejak saya membeli telepon genggam itu tahun lalu baru kali ini berdering di dalam rumah biasanya hanya dipakai di kota kalau di rumah telepon itu hanya jadi mainan anak saya
7552564 tetapi saya tidak menyangka secepat itu ada sinyal telepon di desa saya saya langsung menelepon adik saya di biak papua mirayati kami sudah dua tahun tidak bertemu
7552565 di sini tidak ada sarana komunikasi pada tahun 2007 pemerintah memasang radio ssb tapi radio itu sering tidak tembus dengan radio ssb lainnya tidak ada koran yang masuk karena jalan buruk kalau mencari informasi di kota ongkos ojek perjalanan pergi pulang rp 200 000 karena jalan rusak
7552566 karena bukan berstatus jalan kabupaten kami tidak bisa memperbaiki jalan itu padahal warga sangat kesulitan memperoleh akses transportasi dan berkomunikasi dengan dunia luar jadi jalan tetap seperti itu rusak parah
7552567 kalau ada longsor hubungan dengan masamba terputus sama sekali kami tidak akan mendengar informasi apa apa yang terjadi di luar sana kabar duka pun sering terlambat
7552568 dulu kontroler perkebunan belanda sering berlibur ke rinding allo mengendarai sedan yang bisa masuk ke desa kami lain sekarang hanya mobil bergardan ganda yang bisa masuk itu pun baru mulai 2003 karena sebelumnya badan jalan buatan belanda telanjur menjadi jalan setapak
7552569 sampai sekarang dana uso yang dikumpulkan pemerintah sejak 2006 senilai rp 1 7 triliun tetapi dana itu tidak bisa digunakan karena lelang ulang tidak bisa dilakukan untuk lelang ulang kami harus menunggu putusan pengadilan tinggi tata usaha negara jakarta yang mengadili gugatan salah satu peserta lelang itu
7552570 apa yang kami lakukan sebenarnya tidak terkait dengan program uso pemerintah kami memang pernah ikut lelang proyek itu tetapi murah sehingga tidak lolos tender kali ini kami hanya melakukan ekspansi jaringan dan kebetulan sebagian pasar yang kami bidik termasuk dalam 38 000 desa program uso pemerintah
7552571 kami masih optimistis pada tahun 2008 bisa menyelesaikan 1 500 bts di desa terpencil ini penetrasi pasar yang ekonomis di rinding allo misalnya bisa diperoleh tambahan pendapatan rp 8 juta dari tujuh kanal yang ada
7552572 yang jelas tidak ada hubungannya dengan pajak karena itu merupakan kewenangan departemen keuangan insentif yang diberikan terkait penggunaan frekuensi bisa saja memberikan tambahan frekuensi atau memberikan lisensi tambahan kepada operator seluler itu
7552573 tahap awal pico bts itu menggunakan listrik generator kami berharap pico bts itu bisa menggunakan jaringan listrik mikro hidro milik warga rinding allo seharusnya bisa karena konsumsi listrik hanya 100 watt
7552574 kalau mengambil listrik dari pembangkit listrik mikro hidro kampung kami itu tidak mungkin karena rumah setiap warga saja hanya mendapat jatah 50 watt kalau kami diberi generator pembangkit listrik siapa yang harus mengisi bensin harga bensin di rinding allo rp 15 000 per liter dan setiap malam generator itu membutuhkan 12 liter bensin

7552586 we see no reason why they should proceed with the case

7552600 theyre not giving up on me just because that deal with huet happened
7552601 if he wasnt talking to me i think it would be a totally different situation
7552602 him letting me know that they still want me that theyre still trying to find room for me it gives me a little bit of extra motivation

7552625 i tried to keep it steady but with all the wind today was harder than the other days
7552626 we were battling every single hole and every single shot
7552627 it seemed like even after i had the lead in my group i didnt know what the group ahead of me had done so i was just trying to make as many birdies as i could
7552628 i started out slow i was a little nervous out there
7552629 but i was able to calm down after my birdie on no 6 and got another one on no 11 and those helped me fight off the nerves i played it safe on the rest of the holes and its exciting to get my first win

7552795 not only is it a gigantic crowd but its a crowd that is fun to play in front of and lifts our team to play well
7552796 there were a lot of things in this match we could build on
7552797 the overall fitness of the team was good were always proud of the way we can run the pace of a match we did a good job of limiting chances but weve got to be able to close people down
7552798 they mcneese are a very well coached and organized team
7552799 the biggest issue for us tonight was that our players were more relaxed so many of our players first college game was in fridays win over rhode island in front of the second largest regular season crowd in ncaa soccer history which can be quite a shock to a young players system on the flip side thats part of what happened to mcneese tonight
7552800 we were shocked because we played our set during the toadies
7552801 this next song has a country feel for you college station
7552802 its awesome were in college station right now we usually play in austin but they are a bunch of hippies right

7552820 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7552821 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7552822 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals

7552825 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7552826 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7552827 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7552828 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7552829 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7552830 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7552831 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552832 he needs to be more forceful in his comebacks to mccain
7552833 after watching what happened in 2000 and 2004 i think he has to fight back
7552834 he waited too long to respond to the swift boaters
7552835 you can defend yourself without being evil and negative look at how barack handles a fight mccain calls him unpatriotic barack just talks about mccains policies
7552836 when he didnt ensure the cone of silence i wanted to take all his books back the whole debate was flawed
7552837 i have one at the university of georgia and one whos an intern at american university im concerned about them i think barack cares about their future health care jobs the economy
7552838 what you need to do is to look at the bible look at 1 samuel 24 thatll tell you why barack wont do evil
7552839 everyone reach over and hold the hand of the person nearest you
7552840 you are more righteous than i for you have repaid me good whereas i have repaid you evil so may the lord reward you with good for what you have done this day
7552841 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552842 if youre a little bit critical of barack obama you get really a pie of vilification right in the face
7552843 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7552844 i know that barack obama is a near perfect political package
7552845 but the rap on obama is that he is a fog of a man we know little about him and for all my admiration of him i wonder about his mettle
7552846 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552847 a confused old man or maybe a volatile hothead or perhaps a pampered plutocrat
7552848 sadly the only way to restore the status quo ante may be for the obama campaign to try to stamp its own adverse character narrative on mccain maybe he is a confused old man or maybe a volatile hothead or perhaps a pampered plutocrat all these lines of attack are about as unfair as the kerry as flipflopper and obama as celebrity charges and in a perfect world obama would not resort to them
7552849 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552850 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002
7552851 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552852 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7552853 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7552854 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7552855 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts

7552858 joe biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security
7552859 sen biden is a long time leader on key energy and environmental issues and the members of lcv enthusiastically support sen obamas choice
7552860 he has been outspoken about global warming for a long time we think that will make a very strong team biden has demonstrated a commitment and values that were the reason we
7552861 combining somebody who believes that global warming is a priority and is ready with the foreign policy experience you have a coherent and new direction unlike what weve seen over the last eight years
7552862 i think youre going to see a dramatic shift in u s foreign policy where we can regain some of this lost leadership
7552863 if i could wave a wand and the lord said i could solve one problem i would solve the energy crisis
7552864 i would be most capable of getting this country back into an international climate regime getting us back to the table the fastest and with the most prospect for success because of my extensive engagement in foreign policy
7552865 im also in the best position to make it clear to the united states congress that this is not merely an environmental issue it is a security issue
7552866 to deal with global warming you have to change the attitude of the world particularly china and india the two largest developing nations but in order to do that to have any credibility you have to begin here in the united states by capping emissions increasing renewable fuels establishing a national renewable portfolio standard requiring better fuel economy for automobiles
7552867 i dont think theres much of a role for clean coal in energy independence
7552868 a lot of things will be competing for the attention of the new administration and i think its important that the obama biden administration realizes not only the environment fundamentals but that all of the proposals for a clean energy future will be really helpful for the economy at the same time that they help the environment
7552869 i think there really is a good opportunity there to prioritize these issues and solve a lot of problems at once and i hope the administration will be able to quickly take advantage of that
7552870 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552871 mccain is doing enough to bring those women voters back
7552872 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7552873 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7552874 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7552875 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7552876 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression of the thirties and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7552877 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7552878 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better
7552879 very much one of financial caution as regards the next year
7552880 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7552881 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7552882 oh why cant xxx company have this new xxx feature on their product
7552883 crop receipts were up 30 8 per cent and stood 56 9 per cent above the previous five year average for a january to june period largely due to higher prices resulting from tight world grain supplies and strong demand
7552884 the average price received by hog producers was 21 7 per cent below the price for the first half of 2007 as robust u s hog production and the higher canadian dollar continued to pressure prices downward
7552885 this optimism comes despite weather related challenges earlier in the growing season such as excess rainfall in many areas of the country and hail in parts of the prairies
7552886 just as the big boost to infrastructure ive announced today reflects last years strong economic performance the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement twelve months from now
7552887 ontarians deserve to know where all federal parties stand on fairness for ontario

7552895 the abcc is the last vestiges of howards unfair ir laws
7552896 no other workers in this country apart from workers in the construction industry are faced with this sort of heavy handed and undemocratic assault on their human rights
7552897 it started or a discussion started about a parallel campaign a complementary campaign to the overall your rights at work campaign
7552898 its a continuation of the campaign but its a different phase and applying some of the same techniques
7552899 we will be adhering to our election commitments including the abcc
7552900 we gave specific commitments that it would remain as it works now
7552901 most caucus members want to get rid of it before 2010
7552902 people voted against work choices and this is part ofit
7552903 one thing we have been clear about from the very start of this government has been that we deliver our election promises
7552904 weve all been caught up in a horrible situation not of our making
7552905 all of us sunama the children are all victims of what happened
7552906 the authorities overseas should be held responsible for carefully checking all the agencies and making sure that their credentials are absolutely beyond any kind of doubt
7552907 i feel for sunama to the greatest extent because she was the one who lost the children
7552908 and for the children because theyve had to come to terms with a fundamental part of their identity being changed
7552909 as i watch whats happening in the liberal leadership he seems to be riding a very clever tour de france sort of race
7552910 hes sitting in behind sheltered from the wind ready to make his move whenever he chooses
7552911 the government is busy basking in the benefits of this policy while leaving the environment to pick up the tab
7552912 been astute enough to pick up what might be a current hole in the resource efficiency capability of not only victoria but also the nation
7552913 encouragement to deal with a whole of life issue concerning products that may ultimately end up within the waste stream
7552914 i am happy to look at local based regulation and market mechanisms but also harmonisation with other jurisdictions across the nation to try to make sure we have the appropriate investment and regulatory environment whether that be most appropriate in state or national jurisdictions
7552915 clearly more focused on collecting accolades than the environmental issues associated with their policy
7552916 in the next decade victoria will be faced with tens of thousands of dead hybrid car batteries with no environmentally sustainable way of disposing of them
7552917 i want victoria to lead the way nationally in developing a clear framework for identifying when and what products require recycling at the end of their use including car batteries and the most appropriate market or regulatory approach to achieve that

7552930 there are amazing comic performers around the world and there are fans who want to see them we saw an opportunity to deliver that service
7552931 but we are not saying you have to come to rooftop we will find you where you are
7552932 in the beginning it was about single clip videos but now the mainstream content has come online and there is an expectation for quality
7552933 one of the challenges we all have now is that the web audience has adult attention deficit disorder and moves around quickly a company that draws audience by creating a destination will win the video war
7552934 its all about creating tv like experience the advertisers need to be able to predict frequency which allows brands to build the presence with viewers
7552935 creating a virtual cycle between watching tv and online so they are complementary is the future of the industry
7552936 its very empowering for our fans to know that there are tens of thousands of people watching the show at the same time
7552937 right now we are talking about pc and tv but soon every device will have a potential for video your photo frame will stream videos from grandmas visit or broadcast the weather channel
7552938 pretty soon the idea of tv sitting in the living room will disappear
7552939 we talked about what we could do with colleges given the fact that we have so much traffic coming from them
7552940 the light bulb went off by simul streaming fringe and sarah connor the college students get to see the show and we get the increased fanbase and buzz
7552941 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
7552942 the widget channel enables interactive applications and tru2way technology has opened the door for these types of innovations to work in the cable industry
7552943 just ask microsoft its interactive tv platforms do what the widget channel does and much more and the software giant has had dozens of blue chip partners over the years all to no avail
7552944 one of the things weve learned from our efforts in wilmington is that its particularly helpful to have people on the ground
7552945 it is an awesome display of creativity by our member stations
7552946 its a general concern that were doing all we can
7552947 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed
7552948 this incredible top down control is not having a good effect on the developer community
7552949 a court might be sympathetic to an argument that it is overly broad
7552950 the need to protect is less when the product has been released but no individual wants to be the one to take on apple
7552951 theres a lot of people id like to help with code that i cant
7552952 if this goes on the number of upset customers will increase
7552953 were seeing some bad applications on the iphone its stifling innovation
7552954 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7552955 judging by the rhetoric of the last few days it seems things are moving toward a sharp confrontation between russia and practically the whole of the rest of the world
7552956 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7552957 we dont feel or see any advantages from membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden
7552958 certain sectors of our economy above all agriculture are carrying a fairly heavy load
7552959 its another reason for investors to question the governments commitment to not just the reform agenda but the whole economic program that was set out as part of the political transition
7552960 the main concern for investors from all these recent events is that the program could be materially changing
7552961 i e perhaps less emphasis on the diversification and the openness
7552962 we have closely studied the on line agricultural and rural policy statements of the two candidates and their voting records
7552963 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7552964 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7552965 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7552966 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7552967 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7552968 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7552969 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7552970 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7552971 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7552972 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7552973 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7552974 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7552975 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport
7552976 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
7552977 we apologize for any inconvenience and will announce more information on these two dates as soon as it becomes available
7552978 with a developer or studio who wants to make it happen
7552979 because theyre ignorant racist and dont like people that arent like them
7552980 im glad we dont have people like that in our neighborhood
7552981 while realized investment losses on aigs insurance investment portfolio may decline compared to the second quarter of 2008 if aig continues to hold its exposures a de risking strategy may result in losses remaining elevated given the very poor liquidity conditions for securities with residential housing exposures
7552982 also reflects ongoing uncertainty associated with aigs potential for additional realized and unrealized losses on its various residential mortgage backed securities related exposures including its portfolio of credit default swaps and resultant collateral posting and capital needs
7552983 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
7552984 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7552985 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7552986 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7552987 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
7552988 some were hoping for a rate hike us included it didnt happen
7552989 the markets are very negative on countries that they believe are behind the inflation curve korea is another one
7552990 the markets are very negative on countries that they believe are behind the inflation curve
7552991 the bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity
7552992 overall the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends
7552993 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7552994 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7552995 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7552996 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7552997 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7552998 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7552999 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7553000 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment
7553001 this represents a 67 percent survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7553002 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7553003 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7553004 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7553005 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7553006 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7553007 i am not sure if i am ready to get rid of this
7553008 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7553009 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7553010 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7553011 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7553012 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7553013 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7553014 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7553015 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7553016 without hesitation that it is a 100 percent guarantee that home will be released by the end of this calendar year
7553017 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7553018 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7553019 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism

7553022 the reason for that approach is that east of the mississippi river most plant cables fiber optics etc are all buried the west is all buried plant
7553023 now contrast that with verizon you have a different story because most of verizons plant is aerial housed on telephone poles we cant afford to tear up everybodys neighborhood its not a question of desirability to fiber to the home its whats affordable to consumers qwest has 75 percent to 80 percent of its plant buried verizon is the total opposite
7553024 ultimately a limit to what a consumer can consume in terms of information
7553025 allow a companys it systems to be shared between different cloud computing services and moved freely between them
7553026 several small cloud computing firms including elastra and rightscale are already on board with 3teras standards group
7553027 is ambiguous are they on board with specific goals and a candidate specification or are they on board with the general idea that it might be time to talk about some kind of standard in the general area of utility computing
7553028 what will the market adopt that also helps my product to work
7553029 allow a companys it systems to be shared between different cloud computing services and moved freely between them

7553032 i dont think it will resolve itself because regardless of what happens with fuel prices were going to need more funding for transportation alternatives such as transit freight rail but i think where we may be lucky is that we didnt strike the deal that was on the table the asphalt centered deal thats where i would completely agree with you that we will look back and say we were lucky we didnt pour even more money into a system that doesnt fit our future needs very well
7553033 if you assume that the prices that we are seeing are in fact going to be with us for a very long time thats not an unreasonable notion but my thought is that planners are probably making too much of this that reporters are making too much of this people are saying at last weve reached the tipping point america is about to turn into prague it aint it is a very big mistake to premise the future on something that weve seen for the past six to eight months
7553034 believe me when i pay 80 to fill up a tank of gasoline it comes as as a shock to me and it does defer my thinking on the other hand my wife and i were just in europe and we were paying 9 a gallon and got stuck in a traffic jam with a bunch of europeans paying 9 a gallon
7553035 this planning activity that is getting under way now looks to the future and what are the trends and needs of the highway and transit systems and what the funding needs are going to be to address those i think what youre talking about is a long range planning activity to see if our thoughts about vehicle miles traveled are going to continue holding off or getting smaller and i think youre right i think this 2035 initiative will do a lot of what youre talking about what are the future needs
7553036 youre seeing the first phase of shift in thinking in at least some metro area and state level planning but its lagging
7553037 both the planning and the policy tends to lag the reality a bit and i think the people have been ahead of the policymakers on this one for example we raised over two years ago in our comments on the proposed i 81 widening in the environmental impact statement the need to look at the impact of rising fuel prices on demand and what would that mean in turn for what was the best project and vdot refused to consider that
7553038 from a point of view of an economist you think short term long term
7553039 the short term stuff is sort of a no brainer
7553040 the most likely reaction will be in the fuel economy of the vehicles that we drive we will see the continuation of the travel behavior of the past obviously a little bit of the arithmetic has changed and by arithmetic i mean the tradeoff between time and the cost of operating a vehicle i think that is almost the dispositive understanding of what the public is going to do and what it isnt going to do
7553041 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war is underusing his time as a prisoner of war is outrageous
7553042 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war is underusing his time as a prisoner of war is outrageous
7553043 with not much else to cover this is likely to become the story
7553044 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war is underusing his time as a prisoner of war is outrageous
7553045 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7553046 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison

7553048 ms bynes was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and another car hit her
7553049 it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed the other driver complained of minor injuries

7553051 cameron and a friend were involved in returning an injured dog to its owner
7553052 diaz brought the dog in her house and gave it some food and water her assistant posted a found german shepherd sign and the dogs owner diazs neighbour who was driving around the area came across it
7553053 made time to visit the vet where the dog was being treated

7553057 weve got so much support from such a wide range of parties this is not about more legislation or restrictions on landowners but about willing parties co operating to get things done we also have the support of sustainability minister andrew mcnamara
7553058 there are at least 40 endangered vulnerable or rare species of fauna in the daguilar range and the bulk of our regions water supply is collected and stored there

7553067 relationships are a numbers game and you need to position yourself in a location where you have a greater probability of bumping into a candidate in your age group and single
7553068 as a consequence we need to reset our expectations about believing its only a matter of time before my number comes up and i bump into miss right or mr right
7553069 what young women do not understand is that the interest of many of their suitors may not be because of their hotness it might be that these boys are both lonely and desperate
7553070 to correct this situation women need to deflate their perceived hotness by the proportion by which single men outnumber single women
7553071 rural australia is littered with towns where there is an oversupply of single men
7553072 women have changed their priorities thirty years ago they may have married straight out of school to the farmer next door but now they are saying they want education and training and job opportunities and they gravitate to the cities
7553073 it upsets the gender balance in rural areas and the cities so you have concepts like they reflect that because all these single women gravitate to the city for jobs thats the divide that has opened up and you get these quite remarkable figures like at glenden
7553074 i can foresee an online and interactive heat map linked perhaps to something like
7553075 in other words find me the top 10 towns in australia where there is the highest ratio to single women of single men aged 25 34 who are single catholic and who earn more than 80 000 a year not politically correct but its do able we have the technology indeed i think we will be dating by geography within five years

7553078 amd has an extensive track record of helping enterprises face demanding challenges by enabling flexible virtualized systems that address major issues including server consolidation business continuity and disaster recovery
7553079 amds latest benchmark result underscores the fact that quad core amd opteron processors are more than just four cores and provide innovations such as amd virtualization with rapid virtualization indexing to help deliver an ideal platform for addressing real world data center needs
7553080 enterprises need specific useful tools to make informed it decisions and the vmware vmmark 1 1 consolidation benchmark is a tool to measure the performance and scalability of platforms running virtualized workloads

7553087 instead youre saying i like this item on the menu today
7553088 thats how we get to as close to 0 waste as possible
7553089 fundamentally i think consumers have to understand that some of the responsibility lies with them to create less waste
7553090 if we create less waste we dont even have to consider a need for back end technologies
7553091 a high number of wrong time errors is not surprising and given the lack of clinical significance of the errors observed is probably not a meaningful indicator of quality
7553092 reversibility of metabolic syndrome depends more on the percentage of excess weight lost than on other clinical or demographic characteristics

7553104 das verhalten dieser fans war f r borussia besch mend und peinlich und wirft ein schlechtes licht auf den gesamten verein

7553106 bei der verfolgung von urheberrechtsverletzungen nicht ber das ziel hinausgeschossen wird

7553109 es ist unwahrscheinlich nach so vielen stunden unter schnee und eis und einem sturz von 1200 bis 1500 metern berlebende zu finden

7553117 i love this recliner babe it handles great at speed you should try it nothing for me now though i gotta get back to the airstrip
7553118 i think what you should try is not drinking beer with those pain pills it says right on the label you should avoid drinking alcohol
7553119 its very upsetting and frustrating because we get requests for milk every day
7553120 we need a milk bank for babies who cant get their nutritional needs met by their mothers donated milk can prevent serious infection in babies save lives and greatly improve health outcomes
7553121 we all know that the placebo effect can have a very strong impact on a persons health but beyond that we wanted to
7553122 ah yes this has the potential to provide me with the life i want to have a very nice living build wealth and enjoy the time freedom very real is the potential for a six figure income with this so i am going to become great at it
7553123 its a special moment for me and i want to thank all the fans including those at chelsea who have stuck by me over these two years
7553124 you can already see the hand of mourinho at work here
7553125 we were full of life and beat a really strong team i am really pleased we managed to win in front of our own fans
7553126 it was a positive response and i dont feel any pain i think that all the hard work we have put in during pre season training is beginning to pay off
7553127 i am sorry for him he really felt he had to take one but he had only been on the pitch a short time and he will bounce back from this
7553128 i told totti and juan that i would have scored when my turn came but overall we played well
7553129 he was a quality player but he had his limitations which can be seen by the fact he always struggled when it really mattered
7553130 when he resigned after the defeat to liverpool that was when the coach reminded me of the player
7553131 i can do what i want to do now and i dont have to listen to presidents and coaches its a fantastic feeling after giving your whole life to football
7553132 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7553133 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7553134 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7553135 it was my fault i didnt pay and i didnt respond
7553136 i took care of it and paid the consequences so now all i can do is laugh about it
7553137 when police came to the door i looked and thought ok three teenagers at home
7553138 they presented a warrant and they were kind of half smiling like were going to have to take you in for your library fines
7553139 so she said lets go shopping leave her in there and let her think about what shes done
7553140 at this point ive paid for them and then some
7553141 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7553142 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7553143 there were some ongoing scheduling conflicts that were eventually resolved
7553144 we interviewed him long enough to get all of our questions answered
7553145 our case is still under investigation and were still carrying it as a fire of undetermined origin
7553146 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
7553147 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7553148 i could no longer really afford to live in boston i always loved baltimore i wanted to have a boat so i can sail
7553149 i dont really know i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost like a drug
7553150 was given to me by the one person ive always looked up to
7553151 i always left that ambiguous i never really knew if i was or wasnt
7553152 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7553153 ive worked for persons who worked directly with all the other organizations we have just mentioned
7553154 clark liked to exaggerate he sometimes told stories people wanted to hear so that not everything you hear from some of these old friends is anything but a little puffing on his part
7553155 im quite sure i grew up in new york city
7553156 not denying he might be this person he just doesnt remember hes got a block there
7553157 my dog yeats was always very much in love with amelia henry kissingers dog
7553158 he was very elusive and he had many different past lives
7553159 it was a like peering into the mind of somebody who had lived to be so many different people
7553160 i think he would love to have everybody believe he is all of these characters and identities and i think hes convinced himself so much so that its altered his reality to some extent
7553161 but i do think he is in a way putting on a little bit of a performance
7553162 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out
7553163 if i want to go out and drink and throw a glass in the street ill do it
7553164 as long as the reason is that i want to have fun and not that i want to create some sort of tension around me then id be a d k but im not
7553165 people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a caf talking until 2 a m and never see them again
7553166 i love going out in the summer the girls wear their nice dresses did that sound sleazy it really did didnt it put it like this everyone comes out looking gorgeous in summer we are a more beautiful species in the summer
7553167 we the gossip girl cast were all thrown into this situation with a lot of attention on us and you get a lot of free clothes and s t but thats no reason not to stay grounded what am i really doing baby saving the world nah im on television
7553168 i thought ed was funny and charming and he was very poised he asked me what i did the night before and i said i had gone to rose bar and he told me he loved that place
7553169 he was curious about the good places to go out
7553170 these applications are hardly ever based on real need they are purely based on the greed of the major retailers
7553171 this is all about servicing the needs of visitors to the gold coast
7553172 this is an absolute ambit push by the coles woolworths duopoly to further expand their 80 per cent share of the grocery market in australia
7553173 this will kill us and many of the other convenience stores if it gets up because coles and woolies are just too big for us we only survive now on their crumbs
7553174 the big retailers wont stop until theyve got 6am to 6am trading
7553175 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of freddrenna lyle and leslie hairston and latasha thomas
7553176 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7553177 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
7553178 she knows it natural gas is a fossil fuel but includes it because compared to other fossil fuels coal and oil it burns more cleanly
7553179 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7553180 were really reaching out to democrats theres no question that in particular the woman supporters of hillary clinton are very dissatisfied with the choice john mccain wants to be a president for all americans he is very appealing to folks that want a potus president of the united states that will reach across the aisle with convictions judgment and experience
7553181 i think there are many women here in denver saying you know if you wanted someone who could campaign and you wanted someone who could debate and you wanted someone who could pull a lot of votes why not pick hillary clinton
7553182 it doesnt take a political genius to realize that barack obama needed to nominate a woman for vice president obamas failure to nominate a woman is such a glaring misstep that mccain should pounce and take advantage of it the ticket will nominally be obama biden but to millions of american women it will be obama and not hillary
7553183 i dreamt of killing you again last night and it felt alright to me
7553184 this is the home of the best music fans in the country
7553185 terrible on offense and defense this year according to one al executive and doesnt nearly stop there it even extends to
7553186 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7553187 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7553188 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7553189 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7553190 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7553191 they were in the trail but the problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7553192 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7553193 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7553194 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7553195 it was agreed that there would be a nonpartisan candidate for presidents office which has been violated
7553196 we therefore feel that these repeated violations have forced us to withdraw our support for the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7553197 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
7553198 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
7553199 allow a companys it systems to be shared between different cloud computing services and moved freely between them
7553200 several small cloud computing firms including elastra and rightscale are already on board with 3teras standards group
7553201 is ambiguous are they on board with specific goals and a candidate specification or are they on board with the general idea that it might be time to talk about some kind of standard in the general area of utility computing
7553202 what will the market adopt that also helps my product to work

7553214 a lestrat gia del govern de catalunya de fer una negociaci del finan ament ferma i contundent per educada
7553215 has de tenir una actitud positiva si vols arribar a acords
7553216 catalunya necessita un bon acord un acord com el que van fer ciu i pp el podr em haver fet fa temps per ara tenim un president ferm i educat que defensa els interessos de catalunya
7553217 no s una discussi sobre diners sin sobre recursos per fer front a necessitats b siques com la sanitat i l educaci
7553218 el sistema de finan ament pactat pel senyor mas amb zaplana el 2001 no ens permet cobrir aquestes necessitats
7553219 no creiem adequat com ha fet el senyor homs insultar l altra part negociadora
7553220 els governs de catalunya i espanya volen arribar a acords ha explicat zaragoza perqu s ha de reformar el sistema de finan ament
7553221 l actual model s el que ens van vendre com a definitiu que van pactar ciu i pp fins al punt que el senyor mas va dir que no calia parlar m s de diners sin de sentiments
7553222 mas va dir el 2001 que pasqual maragall no pintava res en canvi ara el govern treballa per mantenir la unitat dels partits
7553223 mentre alguns busquen l escenificaci d un conflicte montilla s el l der que el pa s necessita
7553224 creiem que no s amb la desqualificaci ni l insult personal quan aconsegueixes acords els acords saconsegueixen des de la fermesa i de la claredat del que tu vols aconseguir
7553225 he just said that he felt it was best to go the junior college route
7553226 he had never told me anything i only want people that want to be a part of our program be a part of our institution and be a part of our family i wish trevor nothing but the best and i know his teammates feel the same way
7553227 ive been reading the papers and theyre saying all this stuff about me transferring for family reasons before coach even left
7553228 i just want to let everyone know that isnt true it was news to me it was a shock i didnt know where it was coming from and thats never been an idea in my head
7553229 its even fun convincing the naysayers to think about investing
7553230 but a lot of people understand that even during challenging times theres still opportunity
7553231 it was not unusual to see him slumped across three chairs reading
7553232 he stole the ball from me at center court and it looked to me like he was eight feet away when he took it
7553233 then he took three strides and stuffed it his elbow all the way into the hoop
7553234 on a friendship level hes very personable and sincere and we appreciate that
7553235 my team is my parish thats who i am here to nurture
7553236 up until then id been mystified by the complex movements of the offense and the defense
7553237 but as the season progressed i began to recognize the logic behind every cut every screen every defensive adjustment
7553238 thered be no illegal handouts or payment for phony jobs
7553239 that turned out to be quite a contrast to some of the other coaches recruiting tactics
7553240 fitch said that i had abdicated my responsibilities and until i proved myself to be a true leader of this raw group of players i was no longer team captain i was embarrassed and angry and i played with increased intensity for the rest of the season
7553241 part of phils method is always to set goals that are higher than the ones required by the situation at hand
7553242 so that anybody traveling along with him can sense a greater journey beyond the immediate concerns of winning ball games
7553243 theres a hammock suspended from the ceiling of the living room a dart board with spiro agnews face serving as the target and on the far wall a photograph taken by phil of a colorado mountain
7553244 but i just try to ignore all these extraneous things as best i can theyre all so totally absurd
7553245 i always felt if i didnt get those three or four months in montana to camp to be on the land to actually live on the ground and be connected with the ground then i wasnt really connecting myself with my roots with that pioneer spirit that is so deeply a part of me
7553246 i love my daughter very much but you know i lost and i lost big time in boston
7553247 the largest con i have ever seen in my professional career
7553248 and because i had so much fun doing this one i decided i need to find my new british bff everyone knows i love la but london watch out
7553249 i have a great boyfriend my favorite part of the summer has been the time ive gotten to spend on tour with my love benj
7553250 they say rome wasnt built in a day i wasnt on that job
7553251 the practice of corporations and unions making big convention donations has a long tradition and is criticized by groups that want to limit the role of money in politics
7553252 at the time honored tradition of volunteering at the national conventions
7553253 ive heard that mccain doesnt like reading in print about lobbyists who are helping
7553254 pawlenty promises ceos contact with influential govt officials cabinet president next president
7553255 another round of excessive executive compensation funded by shedding that pesky health insurance benefit
7553256 elect mccain and were for sale to the highest bidder
7553257 are you better off than you were four years ago

7553354 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was
7553355 if you take into account the recent political events congress is unlikely to pass it so to avoid it being blocked it would be right and proper to recall it and let it be looked at by the new administration
7553356 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7553357 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7553358 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7553359 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7553360 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7553361 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7553362 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7553363 unless these can be revised it will be difficult for this treaty to be signed
7553364 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7553365 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7553366 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7553367 we have to recognize however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7553368 at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7553369 successive decisions have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos

7553387 i love dressing chuck bass played by ed westwick i think weve worked to make his character dress really well i want to try and pioneer a movement where straight men dress better girls do it so now its time for the guys to step up and get rid of those ugly t shirts and square toe shoes

7553400 its kind of the last piece of the puzzle you might say of crystal cove state park that we worked on for about 30 years to get in place
7553401 there is just no room anymore for these little private enclaves of people
7553402 that was something from the past and it couldnt continue theres this huge public pressure to get to the coast and be able to camp on the coast and enjoy it
7553403 watching it just sit there in a really bad physical state has really disappointed us
7553404 there had to have been some way for the state and the residents of el morro to work together to see that that didnt happen that there was a more orderly transition
7553405 its just taken us nearly three decades to get to the point where the public will really enjoy this
7553406 id just like my kids to be able to enjoy that spot like i was able to enjoy it

7553459 people are starting to think differently about textiles and more are buying or using linen in the way europeans did in the 19th century
7553460 unlike cotton good linen is expensive but grows more beautiful with time and washing
7553461 before i loved the feel of french linen but now ive come to recommend the japan made product
7553462 it makes sense to support the domestic textile industry not just for cost purposes but simply because new companies in that field are doing great work
7553463 hardly anyone knows about them because they operate on such a small basis and rarely bother to advertise
7553464 theres an unmistakable air of authenticity and romance in everything they make you can tell that they understand and love linen how romantic and evocative it is
7553465 whether the material is natural and how it feels on the skin where it was made whether the process damaged the environment unnecessarily
7553466 people are much more attuned to that sort of information

7553470 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7553471 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7553472 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7553473 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7553474 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds

7553490 we had 60 minutes to come back on fulham and we did not do it is that down to fulham s quality or the fact we were not good enough only the future will tell us that
7553491 lets not make too much comparison the team is almost the same the goal on saturday was conceded from a corner and was not excusable

7553508 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges

7553590 in the districts freedom of the press is still something strange for the great majority of local public authorities
7553591 he is the chief of the territory not the idea contained in the public sector reform that he is a democratic facilitator
7553592 a centralizing figure who believes that he is the centre of power
7553593 this is reflected in everything that goes on in the district sometimes a simple survey in the district can be stopped if the administrator has not been informed he can order the survey stopped to find out who the people are where have they come from and why are they doing this work as for freedom of the press basically he doesnt know about it
7553594 because in compliance with their duties they discovered and denounced a local businessman who stole livestock from the population of barue district and sold it to south african farmers
7553595 symbolizes the attitude of local powers outside maputo and shows that the further we move away from the capital the more our fundamental freedoms are diminished
7553596 because the judges are aware that they may commit blunders
7553597 they even tell court clerks not to reveal the content of their rulings this happened in beira these questions are very serious
7553598 unfortunately practice shows us that judges never pay attention to questions of public interest theyre not going to check whether or not public interest was involved whether publication was in good faith

7553624 major fighting came to an end on friday evening and by saturday they islamic insurgents were in control of kismayo
7553625 our estimate is that some 6220 families about 37 320 people have been displaced since the fighting began on friday
7553626 those who have gone west are facing serious water problems since the area is suffering from drought and is not close to the river
7553627 our figures show that 102 people have died and close to 250 injured these are the ones whose bodies were found or made to the hospital
7553628 they are peacefully disarming hundreds of freelance militiamen in the city that have been causing serious security problems
7553629 businesses have reopened and transport vehicles are back on the streets
7553630 the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue

7553633 there are growing fears that kenyas trading partners could reciprocate a similar stand undertaken by the government by imposing strict regulations on imports from kenya
7553634 in any case mangole was the defendant in the case and there was no way he could sit and decide the outcome of modipanes appeal
7553635 the rules and regulations must be strictly followed if we deviate from procedures as laid down we render the whole process untenable we will be setting a precedent whereby party regulations are broken to entertain unprocedural processes

7553640 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7553641 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7553642 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7553643 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7553644 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7553645 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a rally
7553646 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7553647 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7553648 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7553649 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster

7553651 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7553652 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7553653 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7553654 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7553655 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7553656 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7553657 once we determined that this was happening we were able to separate out the dnc staff and things moved much more smoothly
7553658 were the people who built the whole voting system so if they were trying to vote right now it wouldnt work
7553659 we were here for an hour or two and no one showed up
7553660 we had a minor problem and we dealt with it
7553661 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7553662 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7553663 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7553664 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7553665 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7553666 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
7553667 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there

7553670 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
7553671 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of

7553674 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7553675 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7553676 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7553677 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7553678 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7553679 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7553680 offers the potential for stroke patients to recover return to nearly normal functional status and stay out of nursing homes

7553685 o senador pode apresentar o projeto que ele quiser at um para revogar a lei da gravidade a gente faz mas entrega junto uma nota t cnica alertando que ele pode ser ridicularizado que a comunidade cient fica provavelmente vai contestar por se tratar de uma lei muito importante ele pode seguir nossa orienta o e abandonar o projeto ou insistir e apresentar mesmo assim isso fica a cargo dele
7553686 o projeto chegou bem cru pra gente um dos nossos melhores consultores analisou e argumentou com o senador ramez tebet relator do projeto na casa que do jeito que estava a proposta n o ia mudar nada ia causar ainda mais confus o
7553687 o dif cil foi o senador convencer o l der do governo e o minist rio da fazenda de que as mudan as eram necess rias porque como o senado uma casa revisora com as mudan as o projeto teve de voltar para a c mara para ser votado mais uma vez o que levou mais tempo mas o resultado foi uma lei bem mais completa
7553688 eu achava que a lei de execu o que trata de a es de cobran a podia ser mais audaciosa no sentido de proteger melhor o credor porque as leis sempre t m um vi s mais para o devedor que tratado como coitadinho o que nem sempre verdade mas n o consegui incluir algumas sugest es porque o senador disse que os acordos para a aprova o j tinham sido fechados e n o tinha como fazer mudan as
7553689 o consultor n o pode ter paix o pelos projetos mas verdade que uma das coisas mais frustrantes elaborar um discurso e n o v lo pronunciado
7553690 mesmo a gente sendo ghost writer gratificante ver uma lei sendo aprovada e saber que a gente teve uma participa o ali
7553691 n o h nenhuma restri o ao consultor se filiar a um partido pol tico ele s n o pode transpor sua ideologia para o trabalho antes de voltar para o gabinete do senador um projeto passa por quatro pessoas isso serve n o apenas para identificar erros conceituais e de gram tica como tamb m para identificar qualquer interven o ideol gica que n o tolerada
7553692 muitas vezes um parlamentar representa um determinado grupo e sofre press o para apresentar um determinado projeto que n o vi vel
7553693 o senador n o tem condi o de exercer o mandato
7553694 ele tem conhecimento em duas ou tr s reas mas requisitado para tudo a que a gente entra
7553695 o direito penal tem falta de consultor porque tem muita cpi comiss o parlamentar de inqu rito que tem apelo popular muito grande e por isso os senadores sempre querem apresentar algum relat rio ou projeto a rea de minas e energia com o boom do petr leo e do g s tamb m tem um volume muito grande de trabalho para apenas dois consultores
7553696 o problema que a consultoria externa sempre tem lado n s n o temos lado porque n o podemos ser mandados embora nem temos nosso sal rio reduzido
7553697 the probability of kdb seeking to be a major shareholder of lehman is less than 1
7553698 the priority right now is privatizing kdb and an aggressive investment such as a takeover of lehman will only complicate the privatization process

7553703 im going to have one or two days off then its going to be back to hard training for london
7553704 we have all been so looking forward to coming home and it is amazing just fantastic
7553705 you live in a bubble in the village and really have no idea what is happening at home it is only when you land and arrive here that you see
7553706 it is just incredible the nation has got behind us it is fantastic
7553707 both me and chris came out here to just try our best to get a medal anything else that comes our way is an added bonus
7553708 we are ready to take any decision from nato up to halting relations altogether
7553709 in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions
7553710 my guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations
7553711 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7553712 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7553713 youtube arbeitet nicht erst seit gestern mit einer ganzen reihe von partnern aus dem medienbereich zusammen mit konzernen wie verlagen oder tv sendern haben wir bereits seit einiger zeit sehr gute erfahrungen gemacht

7553772 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
7553773 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
7553774 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
7553775 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
7553776 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind thousands of prisoners we cannot rest until they too are freed
7553777 of course i am very glad that he is coming home and i now want him to get a job get married and settle down but the israelis were in ramallah again last night they broke down doors and took away some people so even when people are coming out of jails others are taking their place

7553782 i blame the arabs for what is happening they should either make peace with israel under just terms or fight them they are too disunited to do either
7553783 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7553784 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7553785 its terrible that this has happened and i think its due to neglect you shouldnt have guns around young children
7553786 the police have been to question all the neighbours i saw the ambulance arrive and that was the first i heard about it i saw the family quite often and they are quite quiet the rumour is that it was the little girl one of his sisters who pulled the trigger by accident

7553788 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle
7553789 i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7553790 they are a nice family and are no trouble to anyone at all the little boy who was shot was a lovely boy
7553791 the family are very upset but it was a complete accident they dont want to talk to anyone
7553792 we were called to an address in washwood heath in birmingham at around 6 40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot he had suffered a serious head injury
7553793 we sent an ambulance two rapid response vehicles an incident support officer and west midlands care team emergency doctors to take the child to birmingham childrens hospital
7553794 oh thats too bad i hope they werent feeling too pressured or unsupported
7553795 its not the sort of decision that can be taken in a hurry
7553796 but we can probably expect some kind of statement over the next few days

7553849 en chile hubo algunos problemas con los auspicios porque las empresas a n no conocen bien el tema entonces es muy dif cil que pongan el dinero para que los jugadores puedan viajar y entonces los jugadores trataron de costear el viaje con sus propios medios

7553882 the democrats traditional penchant for internecine warfare remains a possibility
7553883 after the mccain ad was released yesterday the hillary camp put out this statement hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear
7553884 it never makes the case for obama as a presidential candidate it never even suggests that he is fit to be commander in chief or that he has any of the requisite tools for leadership it merely says that hillary agrees with him on the issues
7553885 from the standpoint of the obama campaign that is surely thin gruel hillary isnt likely to move her followers en masse to the democratic nominee unless she uses her speech tomorrow night to proactively tout obama the person democratic spinners yesterday vowed that the party will leave denver united but it wont happen unless hillary takes one for the team in terms of the partys prospects in november a strong endorsement from hillary albeit through gritted teeth is actually the democratic catharsis that deserves top priority

7553895 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7553896 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7553897 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7553898 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7553899 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7553900 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market
7553901 what is so good this time is that the format is designed to produce real debates the program will be divided into eight ten minute segments ill be moderating the debate on foreign policy and i will open each segment with a question on some specific topic and then it will be my job to get them to respond directly to the question and to each other
7553902 that may be sometime next year or it may be sometime the year after that

7553910 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalized an agreement
7553911 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign after 2011
7553912 were optimistic that iraq and the us can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for us troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7553913 that will continue to be a goal of the united states to be able to turn over those responsibilities to an ever increasing capable and equipped
7553914 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7553915 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7553916 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7553917 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7553918 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7553919 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7553920 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7553921 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7553922 unless these can be revised it will be difficult for this treaty to be signed
7553923 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7553924 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign after 2011
7553925 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7553926 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7553927 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and of iraq
7553928 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7553929 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7553930 new york citys janette sadik khan has a seat at the table
7553931 i think one of the concerns crowds and unruly cyclists could be solved by adding additional routes in other boroughs on the same day three friends who joined me this
7553932 ill just say that while i would have liked more street level commercial activity on the route park avenue has wonderful places on the medians for people to have picnics
7553933 i counted 4 spelling errors on that web page the convention has so many eyes upon it that trying to look professional should be higher on their agenda as for the issues i agree with

7553938 for children ages 10 to 14 who use the internet the computer is a bigger draw than the tv set according to a study recently released by doubleclick performics a search marketing company
7553939 a company that offers online ad serving and management technology to advertisers web publishers and ad agencies
7553940 the study found that 83 percent of internet users in that age bracket spent an hour or more online a day but only 68 percent devoted that much time to television
7553941 often did research online before making a purchase or bugging their parents to make one
7553942 while 72 percent of the children online belonged to a social networking site usually myspace 60 percent of them said they rarely or never read blogs
7553943 its a extension of the marketing technique used by companies such as apple and marlboro cigarettes to have their product blatantly featured in a movie
7553944 but with product centered programming theres no attempt to pretend whatever it is thats being promoted is just an incidental part of an overall scene
7553945 increasingly aware that a 30 second ad break is no longer the effective tool it once was particularly with the young who are technologically savvy enough to dodge ads
7553946 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7553947 those placements are not designed to jump out at you as an ad would but its still very very powerful
7553948 its not explicit advertising but we do know that while youre watching a program all of the content that you see as a whole goes in
7553949 while the television series sex and the city generated business for designer brands such as jimmy choo and manolo blahnik some think the film took product placement too far
7553950 i think they stopped it at 60 to 70 brands represented in that movie if you have too much product placement it just becomes an ad and people are not that interested in watching a two hour ad
7553951 from spending an estimated 4 billion on product placement last year with coca cola leading the way
7553952 advertising federation of australia executive director mark champion said that although product placement was on the rise many clients were still wary it is part of the thinking these days but clients still have to weigh up whether the amount they pay to have their product in a certain program or film offers a good return
7553953 the study found that 83 percent of internet users in that age bracket spent an hour or more online a day but only 68 percent devoted that much time to television
7553954 often did research online before making a purchase or bugging their parents to make one

7553967 i have come to the belief that the constitutional issues involved with school choice are not as clear cut as opponents have argued while lower courts have ruled that vouchers used in private religious schools violate the first amendments prohibition on the establishment of religion the supreme court has not yet weighed in on the question that decision was made by the supreme court in june of 2002 when the u s supreme court issued a monumental decision upholding the cleveland school voucher program as constitutional g in fact the supreme court has ruled that state tuition tax credits for private religious school tuition are perfectly constitutional and the supreme court has ruled that pell grants vouchers for college students can be used in private religious colleges without violating the constitution even some liberal constitutional scholars have noted that vouchers to parents and children may be constitutional even if vouchers were to take money away from the public schools and i should point out that not all voucher proposals do that does not in and of itself mean that public schools will be harmed when you have an area of the country and most often here we are talking about inner cities where the public schools are abysmal or dysfunctional or not working and where most of the children have no way out it is legitimate to ask what would happen to the public schools with increased competition from private schools and what would happen to the quality of education for the children who live there

7554024 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments

7554038 were especially pleased to see three canadian cities joining 40 days for life this fall
7554039 as there will also be a campaign in washington d c this means that 40 days for life will have a presence in the capitals of two nations we firmly believe that this campaign of prayer and fasting will have a profound impact

7554041 planned parenthood is a special concern because it is the nations largest abortion provider
7554042 what we do here is the engineering and developing of the product not the field work
7554043 real sailors and navy officers oversee the work so the navy gets what it wants at the end of the day
7554044 its the model program on how to do it right
7554045 it was absolutely critical its not just hardware but the people who realize what the system can and cannot do
7554046 the requirements for the aegis system come from the pentagon
7554047 but the lockheed martin engineers have gotten smart and come up with their own upgrades the information flows both ways between the navy and industry
7554048 we test the radar and simulate things to test the whole system you have to go to a ship at sea

7554105 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7554106 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7554107 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7554108 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7554109 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7554110 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7554111 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7554112 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7554113 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis

7554120 mccains campaign is cheapening his greatest strength and making a mockery of his already dubious claim that hes reticent to talk about his pow experience by flashing the pow card to rebut any criticism no matter how unrelated
7554121 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7554122 spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7554123 will be prepared to show mccains home in hanoi by using images of his cell
7554124 theyre going to slice and dice the president and then theyre going to tie mccain to bush in the long run thats their best argument
7554125 i think going directly after mccain raises some danger because of the war hero issue
7554126 three in 10 say they support mr obama but have reservations about him or they support him only because he is the partys nominee
7554127 we should be wary of extending marriage to a community with influential people who believe that sexual monogamy isnt that important
7554128 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7554129 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7554130 if i were a hillary clinton supporter this morning id be scratching my head

7554154 looking back im not sure obamas stepfather lolo ever fully understood what my mother was going through why the things he was working so hard to provide for her seemed only to increase the distance between them he landed a job in the government relations department of an american oil company sometimes i would overhear him and my mother arguing in their bedroom usually about her refusal to attend his company dinner parties where american businessmen from texas and louisiana would slap lolos back and boast about the palms they had greased to obtain the new offshore drilling rights while their wives complained to my mother about the quality of indonesian help he would ask her how it would look for him to go alone and remind her that these were her own people and my mothers voice would rise to almost a shout
7554155 while the political set up of the country is engaged in finding a solution to the amarnath row people like mehbooba mufti are airing views in support of the separatists what right does she have to say that any compromise on the issue is unacceptable
7554156 the rightful place for people like her is not the political arena but they should be behind bars on charges of anti national activity

7554160 there is no doubt that the conditions in pakistan were not ideal to host an event of the magnitude of the champions trophy it was sensible to postpone it

7554176 as a responsible opposition leader you must appreciate that the quick implementation of the tata motors project is very important for the state you must be wanting that this project is implemented in this state
7554177 we are facing a critical situation when many other states have offered the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur which we cannot not afford to lose
7554178 we are ready to join a discussion but land should be returned first
7554179 if he bhattacharjee really wants a solution he should return 400 acre and enable the tata plant to come up on 600 acre without making it an ego issue
7554180 alternate land of 500 acre is lying nearby with the cpi m backed promoters where the vendor park of the tata motors can be relocated

7554215 two corners before the end my engineer said on the radio that giorgio has a problem with fuel so push push
7554216 i was down a little bit because i was saving a little bit but then i understood he had problems and i pushed again and could overtake him
7554217 so after the start i was second and after that i knew that grosjean was risking too much when he overtook me i just stayed there waiting for something to happen if nothing happened i would just start pushing because i knew my car was getting quicker and quicker but fortunately both of them went out and i got the lead

7554226 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7554227 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market
7554228 you knew that there was treasure buried out there and it was just a matter of going and finding it
7554229 they want to make the rules one way and we say no if there is a piece of information it is our job to go and get it
7554230 you could look at the strategy and say it did not work out but in the end they energized their campaign added many thousands of names to their database and got huge mileage out of it
7554231 theyre all really lucky to get out of there i think there was somebody on their side
7554232 they could smell the fuel so they didnt waste any time getting out
7554233 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7554234 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7554235 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table

7554238 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7554239 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7554240 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7554241 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7554242 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7554243 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7554244 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7554245 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7554246 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7554247 a gunman is caught up in a deadly battle between two clans in this japanese take on spaghetti westerns with matthew mcconaughey rides a wave of chaos in his life with
7554248 in my opinion this fire is directed at the bed which is kind of a personal area of the relationship with the two involved
7554249 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7554250 if broadcom gets into a lower end dtv box it allows them to target markets like india and brazil
7554251 a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7554252 has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade

7554257 look honey the whole family can fit no no dont walk away wait wait
7554258 she loves the surreal look sound and score and the soundtrack and score will be a theme running throughout the record
7554259 then after the grammys i thought im not going to hear from this dude for the rest of my life
7554260 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7554261 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7554262 when we last left monifa jenkins she was jumping into her pimped out ride heading across town to drop some hot sex on devon
7554263 since your leaving with no good bye summer passes then autumn and with the waning of winter the sickness comes back
7554264 eat local buy local is one of our main initiatives
7554265 its all about promoting local food from the ocean and the land
7554266 the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins necessitates our allocating these coins among the authorized purchasers on a weekly basis until we are able to meet demand
7554267 they told me they wouldnt have taken it if they had known it belonged to me
7554268 so i told them to just give it back and put an end to it
7554269 theyre not quite grasping the fact theyve committed a felony
7554270 a mix of a bunch of different styles of indie rock
7554271 we recognized that the audience saw us the same way we were seeing these bands
7554272 you know four or five dudes with guitars standing still for 45 minutes wed watch the show and think i dont like the guitar style that guys playing and then think you know i dont like my guitar style much either thats when we decided that keyboards had to be the answer
7554273 the market becomes bored with whatever its currently oversaturated with and moves on i think dance music wouldve become popular at some point anyway people just like to feel good
7554274 we have a good energy about us at the moment no matter what other people think
7554275 we are in a good position and it is a great carrot for the team to have the chance of claiming a place in the next round of the uefa cup
7554276 but at the same time the tie is a long way from being finished
7554277 we must be ready for the task and we are
7554278 they said we heard a voice and we didnt know whose voice it was
7554279 that was fabulous then rescuers said we heard two voices ok thats good now theyre alive
7554280 when i first climbed up on the ice and saw that i thought theres no way anyones alive in here
7554281 and then we kept digging and digging and we kept on going and we heard the voices it was just unbelievable ive been doing it 27 years and ive never had a feeling like that before
7554282 they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement which moscow signed with tbilisi more than a week ago said pentagon spokesman bryan whitman
7554283 they are failing to live up to and honour the terms of the agreement he said
7554284 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7554285 one thing i really like about ruby in steel is that is very well documented so you feel as though you are getting something of substance for the cost of the licence
7554286 wenn sie beispielsweise die gesamtstundenzahlen in th ringen vergleichen mit denen in berlin dann ist es so dass die berliner gymnasiasten im schnitt 1000 schulstunden betrachtet ber alle f cher weniger h ren als ihre th ringischen gymnasiastenkollegen
7554287 divide and conquer is not going to work it will never work theyre trying to take pensions away from our new hires theyre trying to take medical benefits away from new hires no its not going to work
7554288 income inequality at the state level was significantly correlated with rates of teenage births juvenile homicides infant mortality low birth weight child overweight mental health problems and high school dropouts as well as with worse educational scores states with higher average incomes had significantly fewer teenage births and fewer children dropping out of high school but they did no better than poorer states on the other six measures of child wellbeing
7554289 believes this consideration represents a substantial premium over an unaffected grey wolf stock price without the influence of precisions previous public announcements regarding its desire to acquire grey wolf
7554290 following discussions over the weekend we remain confident we can find a suitable structure between the various stakeholders for tricom to be appropriately capitalised and to continue to operate effectively
7554291 we are delighted with anzs approach and that it shares our confidence in the tricom business and the opportunities ahead
7554292 with backing from anz tricom will remain an independent broker
7554293 because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasising the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s
7554294 but he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7554295 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7554296 that goes to show you what good social engineering and a well known brand can do for you
7554297 its hard to find out whos in charge of botnets because they use distributed machines all around the world and theres no one central point
7554298 maybe the packer family was unhappy with the share price plunging
7554299 when we extended mikes contract we believed we were entering a very difficult environment
7554300 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure
7554301 we also wanted to get the settings right for us as we got into the storm as dominic was saying we have probably passed through the eye of the storm
7554302 were seeing investors starting to move back into the space and so certainly things are looking rosier than they were
7554303 we see securitisation coming back but in smaller lumps of between 300 million and 700 million
7554304 the business grow and to see the share price go up
7554305 it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7554306 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said theyd be strongly defending the allegations its a slightly different situation
7554307 certainly if theres a full admission then clubs are able to act more quickly than otherwise
7554308 if the allegations are proven then of course his future in the club and in the game will come into question
7554309 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and id say its highly unlikely hed be playing again this year
7554310 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do before any further action is determined
7554311 theyre very disappointed but were basically at the 30km mark of a marathon and were not going back to the starting blocks
7554312 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
7554313 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7554314 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7554315 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system
7554316 this groove is out of fashion these beats are 20 years old
7554317 when the past becomes the now when the lost becomes the found when we fall in love with war when the angel fucks the whore
7554318 should i kiss her in are you ready to kiss on your date
7554319 we felt it was our responsibility to save the country but we were worn out by the divisions and the bitterness
7554320 montague was a place where you could become a new person and we thought create a real opening in the social fabric
7554321 original pioneer still living at packer corners porche wonders if her groups progressive ideas were unconsciously rooted in ancient notions of community
7554322 the future turned retro but what a time taking care of each other the way we did
7554323 it felt like a state of emergency we couldnt go on with our lives as planned
7554324 divisions between blacks and whites meant that some of the guys in the movement as a whole tried to show their solidarity through ideological purity
7554325 wed typically ask our black friends what can we do
7554326 bought a small vacation cabin down the road from packer corners and thus became aware that the farmer had died and his widow was selling
7554327 by memorial day we had gathered our friends and come to look
7554328 the house was locked so we peered in the window
7554329 remember before we signed the deed we posed for our future american gothic for seven if you lived here youd be home now in heaven
7554330 there were no rules and we never took a vote on anything
7554331 we had fewer in winter maybe four then up to 12 in the summer
7554332 we fit in with our neighbors once they got over our beards and long hair
7554333 but they must have asked themselves where does their money come from
7554334 part of the strangeness of all this was that we disavowed money
7554335 our situation was from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs
7554336 in general total loss farm worked better than most communes did vermonts freedom and unity would certainly do as the motto for our farm
7554337 marty had at least gone outdoors before we werent sure what a commune was supposed to be but a lot of us had lived together during college so it didnt seem much different here sharing a kitchen we knew how to do that
7554338 packer corners had a greater tolerance of artists many of us were writers we valued conversation and exchange of ideas montague was always sort of go go go they were much more industrious
7554339 in february they were wrapped in blankets it was very primitive
7554340 theyd accept anybody there was a small core surrounded by many drifters that was a hard luck commune
7554341 neighbors would ask whos in charge here we said we were each in charge of ourselves
7554342 they told us how to avoid chimney fires they taught us how to make sap beer there was a certain amount of ostracism at the beginning but it didnt last
7554343 we were activists who had a vegetable garden in putney
7554344 i wanted to live a nice country life while making films
7554345 robert began to think how great it would be to organize from vermont at that point just three or four people were living on the property another friend had arrived carl oglesby the former president of students for a democratic society in the winter a bunch of us sat around the table talking about communal stuff
7554346 we started the first real daycare center in vermont as a cooperative
7554347 everybody slept in the same room for months that was supposed to be part of getting our shit together there was an enormous amount of self criticism wed sometimes spend all day at it
7554348 it all worked remarkably well i dont remember much conflict within the group
7554349 they were militant lesbians who wanted to use our land for target practice
7554350 we said it was ok to set up tents but they began leaving notes on trees and on our door with messages like male dominance sucks
7554351 they lined us all up searched the house and left empty handed
7554352 it began to feel like the end of the road
7554353 will i ever see this again it seemed as if we would all be killed
7554354 we functioned at an enormous level of intensity we thought the revolution was about to happen at any moment we had a short range apocalyptic perspective which was completely wrong
7554355 he must have been an isolated person even in the midst of a commune it probably soured some people this was an ideal life we were supposed to be living and marshall was the main keeper of the ideals i think we realized you cant just declare the future
7554356 the times changed people grew up people got tired of the poverty and isolation
7554357 i left all my record albums there when i moved out in 1971 it seemed antisocial to take them
7554358 doug you and alex have to get out to the front the line is starting to wrap around manhattan avenue
7554359 michael phelps is great but you cant take swimming all that seriously
7554360 siempre es importante sacar un buen resultado llevar la ventaja tratar de no recibir gol aqu para manejar el encuentro a como m s nos convenga
7554361 es un torneo que es importante y lo m s importante es que san luis lo quiere jugar y lo quiere jugar bien
7554362 los peque os paneles act an de forma muy parecida a una pila y no a aden mucho peso adicional a la prenda
7554363 something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here and become as joyless as they have become it is this individual uncertainty on the part of white american men and women this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives that makes the discussion let alone elucidation of any conundrum that is any reality so supremely difficult the person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality for this touchstone can be only oneself
7554364 what hurts me the most i remember all those things they said to me at home youll be happy dearest son nothing will ever happen to you well always be here thinking of that bullshit makes me feel so awful that i have to come here to hide
7554365 first of all theyre around other parents who have students who are like their students when they bring up issues they can talk about them in the group and people will be like oh yeah i totally get it instead of are you kidding me theyre also getting educated about the needs of gifted and talented students it gives them some background in gifted education that they may not have because a lot of them are going to base their experiences with their student on their own experiences in school
7554366 as a general kind of challenge that one really covers a lot of bases not only for parents who are struggling but also within the school district as well
7554367 it can be hard to acknowledge that students are all over the place developmentally
7554368 when my son came along he was 3 years old asking questions like why does a telephone have to run through wire but a radio doesnt
7554369 he always keeps his own mind busy at all times
7554370 even if theyre doing stuff in school he already knows he either reads a book or keeps his mind busy thinking about something else so its never really been a problem
7554371 when he was fairly young i remember saying something to him like jeffrey if you wont listen to what i tell you who do you listen to
7554372 i dont know if that was a mistake or not that we didnt do it
7554373 in some ways it was in some ways it wasnt
7554374 he wanted to take up the piano but he couldnt just do it
7554375 he had to practice but he couldnt deal with the fact that that he couldnt sit down and do it perfectly weve had a little bit of challenge with the perfectionism
7554376 when you talk about it and you talk about how he has to go up to the high school for math i think some people do kind of think youre bragging rather than trying to vent the frustration about the logistics of it
7554377 i can still answer a lot of his questions which is good
7554378 there will be a day im sure when i cant
7554379 you cant just ship things halfway across the world just to have strawberries all year you have to eat seasonally
7554380 as a musician you can go out there and say i do drugs and drive fancy cars and make kids think thats cool
7554381 what jack and kim and company are doing is the most thoughtful and effective and committed environmental tour thats ever been done
7554382 what theyre doing with the education on the ground the greening of the tour the fan outreach with all at once and the contributions theyre giving its really unprecedented
7554383 seemed a great fit for me because its so fun to find great groups doing great work in communities
7554384 its an inspiring place to be focusing your energy on finding groups doing good work in their own community and bringing them into a network and then plugging in the fans and other people
7554385 a promoter in germany told me that over the years theyve seen so many crazy things on riders like pick out the red m amp ms
7554386 but he thought that at least this was something in the end that seems positive for everyone
7554387 in 2005 the entire attitude in the industry has changed
7554388 now major venues and promoters are rushing to be as green as they can so when the envirorider comes along its really valuable to them it gives them the tools and resources to achieve that
7554389 but because of the finite space and how far away we are it just heightens it
7554390 you have such a higher respect for food when you see it from the beginning
7554391 you dont want to throw away anything you cherish that piece of food
7554392 you have such a higher respect for food when you see it from the beginning
7554393 you dont want to throw away anything you cherish that piece of food
7554394 there are so many lessons weve learned in the garden
7554395 its better to teach hands on about food than from a text book
7554396 especially with increased fuel costs you cant just ship things halfway across the world just to have strawberries all year
7554397 i feel like farm to school solves a whole lot of problems were facing now
7554398 its such a rapid and best solution to so many things
7554399 for us to go out and make a positive change in the music industry has a more positive effect than me just staying home and doing nothing if after we leave people go forward with the connection we help to make while were there that makes touring worth it it makes me feel like we do leave a place better than before we showed up
7554400 at that age when theyre figuring out the way theyre going to approach the world
7554401 doing a show like this gets the kids talking about sustainability it shows them that its not a dorky thing to think about
7554402 thats why it works theyre doing this because its the right thing to do and they want to have a positive impact this is not about jack johnson
7554403 its an understated under promised and over delivered approach to environmentalism jacks the anti politician hes not promising anything hes just doing it hes putting his money where his mouth is
7554404 as a musician you can go out there and say i do drugs and drive fancy cars and make kids think thats cool
7554405 were finding success in terms of connecting with people regardless of whether they live on the coast or whether they surf
7554406 everyone just loves the beach everyone is concerned about ocean pollution what theyre searching for is something they can do
7554407 we were able to connect with a lot of people i just love that face time with people and we had lot of good genuine conversations jack really did a lot for us
7554408 it was really inspiring to see the environmental world and the world of music coming together
7554409 we were able to connect with a lot of people i just love that face time with people and we had lot of good genuine conversations jack really did a lot for us
7554410 jack really made it simple and accessible for people it was about being the greenest you can be wherever you are in that spectrum just try to take it to the next little step
7554411 i think thats important because everyone is in a different situation not everyone is gonna get a hybrid
7554412 ive never been treated better as a volunteer group or felt like i had as much value
7554413 it not only worked its still working as a result
7554414 the only way it continues to get better 20 years from now is to pass it to the next generation

7554416 this is my hope that it gets disseminated and becomes the de facto standard
7554417 environmental riders have been steadily increasing during the last year both in the frequency we see these and in the quality of them
7554418 however this was the most complete ive seen so far it covered all areas of the tour and challenged us to think about what we were doing
7554419 it has been quite a change and setup costs were fairly expensive but it will prove to be a savings in the long run both financially and environmentally
7554420 our entire staff truly thinks and does things more consciously
7554421 this year i see more and more artists asking and requiring earth saving measures at their concerts
7554422 i also see the audiences respecting and appreciating the new rules of living

7554437 in the 10th grade katherine and i heard about a battle of the bands competition and we formed our band for that
7554438 we thought wouldnt it be hilarious if we spelled it with zs
7554439 one year later we no longer found the hilarity in it but didnt think to change it
7554440 we regretted it when we had to introduce ourselves because we had to say it slow it couldnt be something fast and fun
7554441 our first show that wasnt a battle of the bands was when we played at wevl for the pajama party show
7554442 then we walked over to jay etkin gallery and played our first real show
7554443 for the past couple of years we were a summer band and when each summer ended we always said were going on indefinite hiatus
7554444 then we would come back and play a bunch of shows so we figured there was no point we are a band
7554445 our first album dogs boys and nervous breakdowns this album world politics angry love songs its a lot darker
7554446 there used to be houses in the middle of that expanse
7554447 un partido un poco dif cil porque la temperatura fue un poco m s caliente de lo que nosotros pens bamos pero en realidad el grupo jug bien en el primer tiempo pero los ltimos dos goles de ellos fue falta de nosotros porque en el segundo gol el portero ten a que ser mejor y en el tercero le dimos el bal n al delantero
7554448 nosotros jugamos partidos en la liga mls con el mismo m s o menos el mismo tiempo ah pero las decisiones hoy en el segundo tiempo fueron muy malas y en el primer tiempo ten amos unas buenas ocasiones cuando est bamos 1 0 pudimos conseguir el segundo gol y tocamos el bal n un poco m s y ah no lo hicimos y le dimos un poco de vida a ellos y consiguieron el primer gol antes del primer tiempo y yo creo que eso fue la diferencia porque ellos subieron un poquito m s
7554449 un buen equipo tiene el sistema que juega 3 5 2 tiene buenos jugadores pero en realidad nosotros yo pienso que no jugamos muy bien hoy y si hubi ramos tenido la paciencia para mover el bal n pudimos anotar unos goles m s
7554450 s yo siempre quiero ganar porque soy competidor y tengo jugadores que son competidores y quieren ganar estos partidos es una buena experiencia para muchos de esos jugadores son jovencitos que verdaderamente no han jugado muchos partidos en nuestra liga entonces para tener una oportunidad para jugar un partido contra un gran equipo como es veracruz es una buena experiencia para ellos tenemos que seguir adelante
7554451 ahorita tenemos que pensar ya en la copa sudamericana en sacar el mejor resultado posible hablando de goles espec ficamente para llevar una buena ventaja
7554452 lo m s importante es que el equipo ha cumplido el objetivo que era cosechar la mayor cantidad de puntos posibles en el torneo local para poder estar tranquilos en el campeonato y ojal se den las cosas
7554453 lo m s importante es seguir en la l nea respetando al rival en turno respetando los conceptos que nos han venido dando resultados si seguimos por el mismo camino no hay porqu dejar los resultados atr s
7554454 es un torneo que es importante y lo m s importantes es que san luis lo quiere jugar y lo quiere jugar bien

7554460 siempre es importante sacar un buen resultado llevar la ventaja tratar de no recibir gol aqu para manejar el encuentro como m s nos convenga en el partido de visita y poder avanzar a la segunda fase
7554461 objetivos a corto plazo vamos pensando partido tras partido tratando de conseguir resultados importantes llevamos una buena racha con un proceso de menos a m s y vamos a tratar de seguir con eso esperemos que todo se siga dando estamos muy concientes que con la humildad el trabajo y esta continuidad se pueden conseguir cosas importantes y vamos a seguir trabajando sobre la misma l nea

7554469 i always wanted to do another sitcom and i wanted to do another asian american family show but with my first experience i didnt know how it would work
7554470 why would i get a whole bunch of old white men to write my story
7554471 i wanted to do a reality based show because the people were focusing on are so funny
7554472 were all kind of freaky were like the hills with eyes
7554473 were really good friends and its funny because weve grown up together in a lot of ways and have similar themes we do alternative comedy what we do is feminist and queer and fun its seriously hardcore stand up we really are the best
7554474 i dont really understand why anybody would go see that
7554475 ive never seen dane cook so i cant speak to him but i know that comics get mad and really hate him there have been hacks since the beginning of time why get pissed now
7554476 i want us to be part of the television landscape because weve been missing for so long the shows importance to me goes beyond my work as a comedian its not just a reality show its the statement that asian americans are americans and that our stories should be told its much bigger than just my career
7554477 in my first show the network was concerned because they thought i was too fat to play the role of myself
7554478 i was mortified by that so now in my new show im naked in almost every episode you see my hole a couple of times im not normally a naked person because its inconvenient and cold but i make a point of getting naked in the show and on stage a lot its important for people to see what a normal 39 year old body looks like a woman who drinks liquor and eats bacon and doesnt care
7554479 its hard but i think the korean community does want to accept me now
7554480 malaria now affects more people than ever before its endemic to 106 nations threatening half the worlds population in recent years the parasite has grown so entrenched and has developed resistance to so many drugs that the most potent strains can scarcely be controlled this year malaria will strike up to a half billion people at least a million will die most of them under age five the vast majority living in africa thats more than twice the annual toll a generation ago
7554481 its difficult to comprehend how thoroughly zambia has been devastated by malaria in some provinces at any given moment more than a third of all children under age five are sick with the disease
7554482 a million union army casualties in the u s civil war are attributed to malaria and in the pacific theater of world war ii casualties from the disease exceeded those from combat some scientists believe that one out of every two people who have ever lived have died of malaria

7554484 i am so mad if i had been paying my tithing i would quit
7554485 if i should leave this church i would not do as those men have done i would go to some remote place where mormonism had never been heard of settle down and no one would ever learn that i knew anything about it
7554486 brother behunnin you dont know what you would do no doubt these men once thought as you do before you joined this church you stood on neutral ground when the gospel was preached good and evil were set before you you could choose either or neither there were two opposite masters inviting you to serve them when you joined this church you enlisted to serve god when you did that you left the neutral ground and you never can get back on to it should you forsake the master you enlisted to serve it will be by the instigation of the evil one and you will follow his dictation and be his servant
7554487 when we joined this church we enlisted to serve god when we did that we left neutral ground and we never can get back on to it should we forsake the master we enlisted to serve it will be by the instigation of the evil one and we will follow his dictation and be his servant
7554488 thats how they shut it down if you blocked fourteen intersections in denver it would be a disaster

7554505 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was
7554506 if you take into account the recent political events congress is unlikely to pass it so to avoid it being blocked it would be right and proper to recall it and let it be looked at by the new administration
7554507 it has certainly been regarded as something the league has done well in terms of education

7554511 black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
7554512 nearly 70 percent of blacks said they had encountered a specific instance of discrimination based on their race compared with 62 percent in 2000
7554513 the emergence of this cohort has filled the commentariat with joy not just because of what they are bright polite and where skin tone is concerned mostly light but because of what they are not they have been hailed not just as a development in black american politics but as a repudiation of black american politics not just as different from jesse jackson but the epitome of the anti jesse there are many problems with this chief among them is that this new generation is itself a crude political construct built more on wishful thinking than on chronological fact patrick born in 1956 is hailed as part of it but hapless new orleans mayor ray nagin who was born the same year and civil rights campaigner al sharpton who was born just two years earlier are not obama and booker are always mentioned as members of this new club but congressman jesse jackson jr who was born between them and spent his twenty first birthday in prison protesting apartheid is not so whatever else this is about it is not just about years it is one thing to say there is a critical mass of black politicians of a certain age and political disposition it is entirely another to claim that they represent the views of a generation
7554514 the foundation of obamas successful candidacy is the 90 support by the afro american people

7554518 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
7554519 the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7554520 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7554521 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7554538 our goal with the summit is to bring together industry professionals with varying backgrounds areas of expertise and opinions to engage in a thoughtful dialogue about water management and conservation
7554539 it is important to explore our similarities as well as our differences in order to understand how the water scarcity issue is affecting all facets of the green industry
7554540 it has always been important for ewing to educate industry professionals about timely issues pertaining to water management and conservation
7554541 a firm understanding of the value of water in our industry and how to cut down on water waste will boost our customers credibility and value in the marketplace
7554542 my thoughts changed a bit on both water use and the landscape world water purveyors cannot continue to enable the landscape industry and try to do their job for them over the long term
7554543 if we can continue to work together and get the licensed landscape professionals to also understand their role the market will sort itself out with products and practices that work

7554556 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7554557 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7554558 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7554559 paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7554566 he is a valuable member of our national team set up given his recent experiences and his knowledge of football in australia
7554567 in a group that included the runners up in their age group from europe serbia the defending champions and eventual gold medal winners in argentina and one of africas best in ivory coast our performance should be seen in some context
7554568 there is no doubt he can start a test he is perfectly capable of that as are all of them
7554569 ill have a good look at the footage it was great for timana to get the time that he got we delayed his entry obviously and referred to the guys with a background at test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7554570 but when timana got in the game he did well that was my first instinct that he did well having watched it live we will have a look at the footage and pore over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us

7554578 i dont know de villiers but he has been thrown into a difficult situation
7554579 to take what is probably the hardest international job in his first professional job is mind boggling i think he is struggling with it a little bit maybe they could give jake a ring and see what he is doing

7554581 the world youth day events rivalled the sydney olympics for atmosphere goodwill and logistical triumph the pilgrims behaved impeccably our concerns about the long term physical impact of such large crowds on royal randwick racecourse were well documented but the groups exemplary behaviour minimised the impact on the turf

7554615 we need to protect the rights and interests of the workers and elect leaders who will stand up for workers
7554616 of course the bosses within the enterprises want a union chair who will be obedient to the company but we believe the union belongs to the workers not the bosses
7554617 furniture manufactured in china can enter the u s market at 25 to 35 percent of the cost of comparable furniture
7554618 for a long time china was a command economy and unions were subservient to it there was no distinction between labor and capital because we were all part of the nation
7554619 the party worked hard for the development of the working class and to educate workers things have changed with the move to a market economy and differentiation in factories between bosses and workers
7554620 with the enactment of recent pro worker labor laws in china the situation may be changing as workers exercise their rights under these new labor laws
7554621 by developing collective bargaining at the grassroots level enterprise level unions will be transformed into labor organizations that genuinely represent the rights and interests of workers
7554622 trade unions of the foreign invested enterprises in china have firmly centered on production and business operation to conduct activities and have given support to enterprises in their operation and management according to law have educated workers to observe factory rules and regulations and discipline organized workers to launch labor emulation campaigns and aroused the enthusiasm of the workers for running the enterprises well so as to contribute to the sound development of the enterprises
7554623 this successful experience in setting up wal mart unions is groundbreaking in that we have discovered a new line of thinking it not only will influence other foreign and private investors to quickly abide by the law to allow unions to be established it also brings to trade unionists a new mission following the new logic in setting up unions new adjustments in union work will be needed be it in methods in organizational structure ways of identifying backbone activists down to how to use union funds
7554624 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7554625 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7554626 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7554627 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7554628 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won

7554630 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7554631 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7554632 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7554633 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7554634 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7554635 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7554636 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7554637 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7554638 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7554639 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7554640 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7554641 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7554642 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state

7554646 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7554647 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7554648 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7554649 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7554650 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7554651 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7554652 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7554655 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7554656 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7554657 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7554658 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7554659 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7554660 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7554661 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7554662 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7554663 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7554664 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7554665 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7554666 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7554667 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7554668 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7554676 we stand at the brink of a second nuclear age not since hiroshima and nagasaki has the world faced such perilous choices
7554677 as we move more and more to the internet and technology being used the risks are increasing and i think that a lot of the public are not very careful about their identity

7554686 there are clear articles in the agreement that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries
7554687 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7554688 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7554689 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7554690 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7554691 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7554692 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7554693 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7554694 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7554695 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7554696 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7554697 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7554698 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7554699 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work

7554722 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

7554747 manipulaciones folcl ricas como la de andaluc a de pandereta que no resisten una lectura inteligente de su obra

7554846 you could argue that a shift to democrats doesnt mean a shift to liberalism
7554847 is the democratic party shifting from being the party of ted kennedy to jim webb from liberal lions like sen carl levin to moderates like evan bayh of indiana
7554848 in some ways thats the contest thats going to play out this year and in the next few years
7554849 the john testers of montana the mark warners of virginia these are the folks we used to call blue dog democrats the ones from the right wing of the democratic party today some might argue theyre the future of it
7554850 i think its really close to miraculous when you think about what the structure was to begin with and the amount of work thats happened over the last eight months to really transform it for use
7554851 this is clearly a slip form utilitarian structure using mid 20th century technology
7554852 the design intent was to respect that simple character and the exterior accommodations to allow light to get into the structure have been done in the simplest manner to keep it as close as they could to its original appearance
7554853 it was built in 1939 and theres no deterioration to the concrete whatsoever a lot of interior had to be removed
7554854 oh mercy me she exclaims i can hardly stand it

7554868 it works like this someone s negligent or in this case deliberate tortious act caused a government employee to suffer an injury the government employee then was paid compensation and had medical bills these were paid for by the government out of taxes doesn t it make sense to go after the person who caused the taxpayers to suffer this loss note that any recovery will be used to offset the bills the government has already paid for as well as for workers compensation payments

7554891 being gay and diving are completely separate parts of my life of course theres going to be crossover because some people have issues but everyone i dive with has been so supportive
7554892 im happy with myself and where i am im very happy with who i am and what ive done
7554893 im not sure how many of you saw the mens 10m diving finals the other night but it was pretty awesome chinese diver zhou luxin held what appeared to be an insurmountable lead even after botching his final dive it didnt look good for australian matthew mitcham who essentially needed to be perfect on his final dive to win gold but mitcham was burying an incredibly difficult dive that left hardly a ripple on the water as he dove in it was without question one of the most clutch moments by any athlete you will ever see anywhere but what also made the night unique is that mitcham is the only openly gay male athlete in the olympics and despite nbc continually showing shots of mitchams australian cheering section which included mitchams partner nbc never said a word about it normally i dont have a problem with that theres not really any need to show an athletes significant other during olympic events whether the athlete is gay straight or whatever but the problem is that nbc continually made a point to show many athletes significant others during the olympics and mention what kind of a relationship they were in we heard about misty may treanor being married to marlins catcher matt treanor we also heard about track athlete sanya richards fiancee aaron ross of the new york giants we heard about a love triangle between french and italian swimmers and about kerri walsh losing her wedding ring in the sand during a match and we even heard about non spotlight athletes and their relationships katerina emmons of the czech republic won the first olympic gold of the games in the womens 10m air rifle and was shown hugging and kissing her american husband who is her coach and a member of the u s mens shooting team my point is this nbc went out of its way to let us know about the relationships even showing us kisses of a number of bigtime and smalltime athletes but all the athletes were significant in some way so was mitcham he prevented the chinese from sweeping gold in diving his story is truly one of the best of the games but it was also important that we knew he was gay thats because it is incredibly rare for any athlete to come out even after their playing days are over and when an athlete is openly gay while competing it not only deserves attention it deserves celebration the reason why is because the sports world is for the most part an incredibly macho arena and many people including both athletes and fans have the mistaken belief that you cant be gay and be an athlete letting viewers know that mitcham is gay wouldve in my mind helped more people athletes and fans realize that any individual regardless of their sexual orientation can be a great competitor and an olympic champion i know not everyone would have been pleased to hear about mitchams sexual orientation and some would have argued that it would have been an invasion of his privacy to inform us of that information but just think about this for a moment would the people that likely would have had those misgivings in hearing about mitchams sexual orientation have had the same reaction had mitcham been straight my guess is not at all nbc missed a chance last night to help break down barriers that desperately need to come down and for that they should be admonished as for mitcham hopefully his olympic triumph can help us all fans and athletes become more tolerant of people of all sexual orientations in professional sports and in life

7554920 in february 2007 we launched our new municipal leasing program designed expressly to meet the need for police motorcycles among law enforcement agencies throughout the u s an annual market we estimate exceeds 300 million
7554921 at the request of these agencies we have now added other asset classes to the eligible collateral that qualify for our municipal leasing program as an exhibitor at the police fleet expo 2008 in milwaukee last week we met with various law enforcement officials and vendors who expressed the need to have the ability to lease these other classes of vehicles in addition to motorcycles such as all types of tactical and emergency service vehicles patrol cars helicopters and other equipment now required by many jurisdictions around the country we were also approached by certain specialty vehicle manufacturers asking us to provide terms to the budget constrained municipalities that were having trouble finding plans to meet their needs we see this as a significant opportunity to further serve this market
7554922 we will be expanding the asset classes that will qualify to be leased to all levels of governmental agencies we see the municipal market as a great opportunity for sparta given the advantage of these additional qualifying classes of assets that we now have and we look forward to aggressively serving that market and expect it to have a long term positive impact

7554927 in exceedingly competitive markets under tight schedule and budget constraints medical device capital equipment manufacturers and aerospace companies must maintain a high level of quality while meeting performance reliability and safety demands unfortunately the traditional software and product test approaches often associated with their product development efforts is inherently time consuming and accounts for a significant portion of a products development schedule and budget

7554992 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was
7554993 if you take into account the recent political events congress is unlikely to pass it so to avoid it being blocked it would be right and proper to recall it and let it be looked at by the new administration
7554994 the question of peaceful use of nuclear energy should not depend on the current political situation
7554995 you dont expect something like this on one of the towns main car parking areas it has only recently been improved with the installation of new floodlights

7554999 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7555000 there might have been a more spectacular and thoroughly dominant manner in which michael phelps could have begun his olympics on sunday morning
7555001 in a country where eight is a lucky number michael phelps improbable quest for a record eight gold medals hinged on teammate jason lezaks anchor leg swim by eight lucky and dramatic hundredths of a second lezak out touched the trash talking french shattering the world record and delivering phelps his second gold of the games
7555002 i cannot accept responsibility for something i know i didnt do
7555003 i have never exhibited any behavior to indicate that i would be into that child pornography
7555004 i found your version of the events ludicrous and the jury did too
7555005 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7555006 this is one the biggest construction sites in the country we are pleased to see they are vigilant when it comes to protecting the safety of the employees
7555007 it is unbelievable that not a single serious injury has been reported from this big construction site
7555008 this is a great achievement because we do not want the pace of construction to be halted by avoidable accidents
7555009 this is an area which we are going to address quite vigorously during our inspections
7555010 this is the beginning of our blitz inspection we will clamp down all forms of poor safety standards where workers safety is not a priority we will be vocal and take appropriate steps
7555011 the chairman of kwara state f a who is also the chairman of north central states football forum has agreed to host the championship he promised to finalise other details with the relevant authorities in the state he however assured that the sports loving governor of the state who is also the chairman of north central state governors forum would not hesitate to support the course which is meant to promote football in his region
7555012 honestly it will be something that will generate a lot of attention if enyimba qualify along with al ahly to feature in the final both teams had won the title back to back so if it happens it will really be a wonderful time for african football
7555013 other teams have pedigree too but i can assure you that the ultimate will be a final between nigeria and egypt and that is between enyimba and al ahly there will never be any final like it but lets wait and see
7555014 we are challenged by the fact that we lost some of our best players to injury and transfer while two of our best players including emmanuel ekpo left on transfer to america others like ekene emigo and uche kalu have been sidelined due to injury
7555015 it is something we cannot help but we are devastated over the situation given the fact that they are experienced players that would have assisted in our campaign however i believe other players are committed enough and are ready to give their best it is unfortunate that only in this part of the world that players wake up and travel out of the country on trial without respecting the contract they have with their clubs
7555016 from the way we have played you will agree with me that we are focused we have a target and we are working towards it

7555031 it was a game fit to be a final very tense game and all the ingredients of a final supersport united were the better team on the day but unfortunately they failed to utilise their chances

7555034 i believe there were at least three instances where he should have been booked but nothing happened he also stamped on torrealbas hands right in front of me but nothing happened to him this is making me very angry
7555035 he did not only let me down but he let the whole team down with his red card he knows he should not have retaliated as two wrongs do not make a right it is a huge setback for the club and i am very disappointed with this kind of behaviour i will have a word with him about this and will then take it from there

7555133 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7555134 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7555135 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7555158 the financial crisis that grips florida government now knows no modern precedent but nearly as alarming as the plunging forecasts are the numbingly casual reactions in the capital
7555159 to this news key political leaders have reacted by pulling rhetoric off the shelf crist is behaving as though the 1 8 billion number was made up

7555162 crist won national praise last year when he sped up floridas much maligned clemency process and returned the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of ex convicts crist said it was the right thing to do winning praise from civil rights groups stymied for years by the states refusal to reform a reconstruction era system they contended was designed to keep blacks from gaining political power florida was one of only three states that did not automatically restore a felons right to vote hold job licenses serve on juries and other rights after serving prison time but in the 15months since crists announcement and 10weeks before a historic presidential election only a tiny fraction of those ex convicts have registered to vote
7555163 some of the ex convicts clearly never made the effort to register but the reasons also include state budget cuts bureaucratic indifference and a failure by crist and his administration to follow through on the changes the governor ordered

7555167 cheaper is rarely better its just cheaper for the time being but quite possibly much more expensive down the road with our economy in tatters and new constraints on public spending elected officials in florida face more difficult challenges than ever how with reduced revenue streams and a wave of anti tax sentiment sweeping the state do they see past the bleak present and still find ways to invest in a more hopeful future clearly it requires the courage to set priorities that will make some people and interest groups bitterly unhappy and the vision to realize that we cant continue to use a long term strategy of sandbagging

7555175 i grew up pulling for ole miss my parents went to ole miss and ive grown up going to their games i have friends go their just as students and friends that are on the football team theyve offered me a walk on spot im hoping that they find a scholarship for me they said they might im looking for a scholarship

7555195 per lenologia veneta ha affermato il vicepresidente franco manzato un nuovo importante traguardo di qualit nel cotesto di una piramide produttiva capace di soddisfare qualsiasi esigenza con punte di assoluta eccellenza mondiale al migliore rapporto prezzo qualit e che non sia una frase fatta ma un vanto concreto lo dimostra il fatto che il veneto esporta allestero oltre il 60 per cento della sua produzione enologica per una quantit che nel 2007 ha superato 4 791 039 ettolitri per un valore di 930 517 339 euro di questo valore 543 879 884 euro rappresentato dal vino venduto nellunione europea 250 828 584 euro da quello venduto in america settentrionale il veneto esporta dunque oltre il 28 per cento della produzione nazionale in quantit e valore e questa quarta docg che si aggiunge al recioto di soave docg al bardolino superiore docg e al soave superiore docg foriera di ulteriori traguardi economici di soddisfazione per i produttori e di valorizzazione del territorio
7555196 a questo proposito ha aggiunto manzato confermo la volont di utilizzare i nostri vini e le altre produzioni agoalimentari di qualit del veneto come veicolo di promozione secondo una strategia che prevede di accompagnare i nostri prodotti certificati con il logo unificato del leone di san marco affiancato dalla stella a sette punte e dalla frase

7555199 shes gonna live but its going to be a long haul because shes going to have a lot of physical therapy and probably some mental therapy
7555200 she tried her best to get to it to the point of actually pulling and breaking chains
7555201 what the next 40 years of technology might look like
7555202 im addressing how we expect to see the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence close over the next 40 years
7555203 may go exponential in the next few years where technology is literally advancing on a moment by moment basis
7555204 if you are using charge to represent information then cmos is the most efficient architecture
7555205 so our near term focus is on improvements in processing
7555206 the important thing is that all these vertical structures will be on the surface no longer being built in the bulk
7555207 once you are on the surface you could even add iii v materials
7555208 will future electronic devices be charge based like they are today for our cmos technologies or are they going to rely on some other quantum property like spin or might they use some sort of molecular technology where we use molecules to perform the logic function
7555209 gives robotic hands the ability to sense an object before it touches it
7555210 this is the kind of sense that fish have sharks can do it and eels can do it but if we ever had it as humans weve long since lost that capability
7555211 being able to grip is a fundamental ability for humans so our question becomes can we imbue machines with a comparable capability
7555212 we may see new types of sensor modalities such as pretouch coming into widespread use as a result of our attempt to mimic human capabilities
7555213 at 70 percent efficiency we could wirelessly recharge all kinds of electronic devices even laptops just by building coils into work surfaces and then bringing your laptop or other battery powered device into proximity to recharge it
7555214 what if we could build nanoscale devices with a little bit of intelligence and mobility that could assemble themselves into arbitrary shapes imagine a future printing device that you fill up with programmable matter push the button and out comes a complete 3d object capable of movement color change luminescence
7555215 the acquisition significantly strengthens our position in the key military and aerospace markets with major customers in the u k and europe
7555216 we are acquiring a profitable business which will benefit from the groups global sales network and our technical capabilities
7555217 in the area of static power fpgas were killing the competition
7555218 actel is the leader in low power fpgas but the problem is that nobody knows it
7555219 i like them and they like me but they want to kick my butt instead of kicking my butt i want to kick their butts
7555220 actel is well positioned for revenue growth with its current product offering
7555221 actel has been attacking the low power low cost portion of the fpga market and this is where we are expecting most of the growth over the next three to five years actel gained market share in 2007 and we expect them to gain market share in 2008
7555222 even low power sram based fpgas draw on the order of ten times more power than specified for typical battery operated applications sram based fpgas also experience power surges at start up that drain batteries and can cause system initialization failures compounding the problem each process node shrink increases the static power consumption of transistor heavy sram based fpgas
7555223 pigeon point is the de facto standard in the tca arena
7555224 as tca experiences rapid deployment across the increasingly power sensitive telecommunications military and industrial markets the merger of their market and technology leadership with actels power and system management solutions gives us an opportunity to capture a significant portion of the tca system market
7555225 working on designs to expand our imagination about what money might look and feel like in the future
7555226 message is that instead of digital technology creating some single universal form of money it is actually doing the opposite forms of money and different types of payment systems are actually proliferating into all sorts of incompatible versions and for the foreseeable future we think that is what digital money is going to be like
7555227 technology gives people the opportunity to differentiate and that opens up opportunities at intel to help people deal with all this complexity

7555236 the fresco logic demonstration shows the significant performance increase that will be supported by devices and hosts based on the usb 3 0 specification and the value it will bring for consumers
7555237 we have leveraged over ten years of system level and ip design expertise to architect a superspeed usb host and device controller ip that performs to the exact standards of the market and this demonstration represents the quality of work we have done
7555238 we will continue to work closely with our partners and the usb ecosystem to enable the successful deployment of the superspeed usb standard into the design community

7555257 not by the quality of the words but the number of page views those blog posts get gawker is growing page views while simultaneously destroying its brand equity
7555258 excelling in blogging today is about link baiting the act of writing something inflammatory in order to get a link
7555259 there is a inverse correlation between your success and your ability to tell the truth
7555260 open media i e blogging has turned into an excuse for bad behavior
7555261 there is zero tolerance for waste in personal communication so if you dont find value in this email youll delete it and maybe remove yourself from the list

7555269 people companies anything that doesnt evolve and doesnt select the technology
7555270 people companies anything that dont evolve and dont select the technology
7555271 i love shiny new stuff and you dont so youre less evolved than me
7555272 can do this in my 20 year old language with the methods i was using 10 15 years ago
7555273 the whole point of this is to allow people to use sick days if they need them

7555281 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7555282 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
7555283 eu acho que o kdb deveria ter considerado formar e liderar um cons rcio para comprar o lehman brothers

7555312 the first charters were similar to magnet schools the school served a specific purpose in a specific location
7555313 in my opinion charters were started as election tools for the 2002 gubernatorial election
7555314 the charter system is a threat to the standard public education system
7555315 it causes districts politicians and others to ignore the local schools quality
7555316 cnet news reporters declan mccullagh stephanie condon and kara tsuboi will be on the scene covering the tech policies and positions of the presidential and vice presidential candidates in addition they will be roaming the convention floors interviewing delegates politicians and pundits on tech related issues such as net neutrality internet taxation and privacy

7555333 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
7555334 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7555335 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7555336 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7555339 reversibility of metabolic syndrome depends more on the percentage of excess weight lost than on other clinical or demographic characteristics
7555340 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment
7555341 this represents a 67 percent survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7555342 a high number of wrong time errors is not surprising and given the lack of clinical significance of the errors observed is probably not a meaningful indicator of quality
7555343 the project had delivered in august 2007 but in may 2008 continued to sow grass

7555352 the result of this operation thus far has been a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds improvised explosive devices along highway 1 in kandahar
7555353 it has thrown them off balance and we will continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance
7555354 but i personally believe we have taken out some of the key leaders that have conducted some of these ied operations that have affected local nationals afghan security forces as well as isaf soldiers
7555355 one of our key focus areas is to maintain a high tempo to make sure the enemy is off balance at all times
7555356 ultimately the operation we did the other day was focused on hitting the command and control cell that ensures that the ied supplies are brought in co ordinates where they are going to be planted and hires the local national or the farmer or the underling to actually implant it so they dont risk their own lives
7555357 the president of the united states is the president of every single american of every race and every background
7555358 we should inform our partners of the need to exit some agreements that currently contradict the interests of the russian federation
7555359 we see virtually no advantages but we are carrying a burden
7555360 that does not mean we should abandon our strategic goals of moving toward wto but we must be clear when dealing with our partners
7555361 according to our information south ossetian militias want to take this village our forces got the order not to shoot but if ossetians start shooting they will have to return fire
7555362 we believe that the ossetians are preparing a provocation there
7555363 about three hours ago georgian policemen occupied the village of mosabruni they told locals to leave straight away villagers are leaving on foot
7555364 south ossetian security bodies are now holding consultations with russian peacekeepers and i hope very much they will not allow a new flare up
7555365 there was always an arc for those characters there was always a place they were going
7555366 i think it would work on a big screen and simon thinks it would work on a small screen
7555367 my feeling is that spaced is about little people having big ideas and it worked as a tv show because the medium was small and seeing those grand cinematic sweeps on the television was fun the minute you put it on the big screen it loses some of its power
7555368 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
7555369 the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7555370 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7555371 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7555384 hillcrest labs considers that nintendo has infringed four of the companys patents the strange thing is that two of them were filed after nintendo had launched the wii console in the united states and that these two patents had been approved only a few days before the company filed the suit
7555385 taking into consideration that nintendo has recently become the best selling console of its generation in the united states it might be possible that hillcrest labs is only trying to make a few money edit assume they meant dollars bucks out of the japanese companys success

7555399 the videojet 1510 design is a direct result of extensive feedback from videojet customers who indicated that production line uptime and consistently high print quality were their top coding concerns
7555400 videojet has responded with a small character ink jet printer with smart features that virtually eliminate operator mistakes and provide long intervals between maintenance facilitating uptime peace of mind
7555401 extreme hot and cold conditions can interfere with ink viscosity which affects print sharpness and quality
7555402 the videojet 1510 printhead automatically adjusts based on changes in the environment to ensure consistent code quality regardless of the current conditions that means operators dont need to spend time manually adjusting the printhead

7555671 avoid the flimflammery of green consumerism itself an oxymoron unless there is a truly useful discovery or breakthrough to report perhaps that would assuage some of the eco anxiety out there and allow readers to think about more meaningful ways to help their planet

7555674 dont worry if you know the song your fingers know it so get your head out of the way
7555675 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7555676 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7555677 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7555678 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7555679 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7555680 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7555681 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7555683 if youre paying money to attend a week four preseason game youre dammed fool
7555684 oh a nadal vs djokovic semi in the bottom half federer gets another break although murray could be tough
7555685 platsen s g ut som att vara tagen ur en kinesisk saga
7555686 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
7555687 theres always a bit of fire when theres smoke around for sure
7555688 but to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it a tad too far
7555689 to send him out half busted when the game wasnt on the line would be an unintelligent thing to do as a coach you guys sometimes make up some stuff thats just rubbish honestly
7555690 you need to stop chasing controversy and watch the games and enjoy the games
7555691 theres a lot of good teams in the competition so if we start believing that we aint going to be doing what we need to do
7555692 im not quite sure where thats come from manly have been a really consistent side all year and we only got them by six points two weeks ago
7555693 we arent thinking along those lines we never have and we never will
7555694 every side i suppose apart from manly is looking and asking how do we get up there above them
7555695 the game has evolved from year to year and melbourne has been one of those sides that has taken it to another level
7555696 bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball
7555697 there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7555698 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7555699 and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7555700 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7555701 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7555702 no one shall rub the ball on the ground use any artificial substance or take any other action to alter the condition of the ball
7555703 thats ancient history and were not going to breath life into the dust of ancient history
7555704 right now we are looking forward to playing bangladesh in darwin and our chance will come over the next 15 months to play against the poms in england
7555705 it actually doesnt bother me at all right now we are looking forward thats history
7555706 i cant believe that a guy who didnt even play in the series has come out with such a comment
7555707 if hed been someone that had played in the series then fair enough because he might have seen something
7555708 over the last century or so bowlers have been fiddling around with balls using all sorts of stuff
7555709 i dont think that trescothicks revelation is earth shattering news
7555710 bowlers have used saliva sun screen lip balm all sorts of things
7555711 going back to keith millers day there were suggestions they used hair cream on the ball
7555712 things like lip ice have been around since i was playing schoolboy cricket
7555713 there have been substances used on cricket balls ever since ive known the game
7555714 the big thing is the scratching on one side making it shiny on one side and rough on the other so it swings
7555715 the scratching of the ball is the big issue rather than what goes on the shiny side
7555716 it can happen naturally and the bowlers are very good at enhancing that a little bit
7555717 in exceedingly competitive markets under tight schedule and budget constraints medical device capital equipment manufacturers and aerospace companies must maintain a high level of quality while meeting performance reliability and safety demands unfortunately the traditional software and product test approaches often associated with their product development efforts is inherently time consuming and accounts for a significant portion of a products development schedule and budget
7555718 with our test automation services we partner with organizations to create a highly structured and encompassing testing approach that helps to align test automation programs with the appropriate regulatory bodys governance statement

7555721 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry
7555722 in a way that is still true its just that instead of a few dozen cottages there turn out to be tens of thousands
7555723 the indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400 000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900 000 nonetheless the two are still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
7555724 when you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet
7555725 you could get rid of it but you would get rid of one of the most fundamental parts of player to player interaction
7555726 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7555727 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7555728 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations
7555729 after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market
7555730 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7555731 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7555732 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7555733 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7555734 you could control not just your chair your tv your computer but your entire life

7555736 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
7555737 despite welcome progress in terms of accessibility and the number of press conferences within the olympic facilities the fccc has been alarmed at the use of violence intimidation and harassment outside
7555738 the club has confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference since the formal opening of the olympic media centre on july 25 and is checking at least 20 other reported incidents
7555739 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china the most disturbing trend was the rise in cases of police roughing up or beating reporters and breaking their cameras
7555740 the chinese government failed to make the olympic podium on media freedom
7555741 there is no new law on the media only new regulations for foreign reporters and poorly enforced at that as for the bills protecting children it is news to me that the ioc has anything to do with it and they are not bills either
7555742 ignores ample evidence that large numbers of people were forced out without adequate compensation and persecuted if they tried to protest or to challenge their eviction
7555743 two rounds of football is too early to draw any conclusions
7555744 our projections over the next few weeks show that we are on track to keep pace with last season
7555745 in addition the opening rounds have clearly been impacted by australians love for the olympic games
7555746 we anticipate the crowds returning over the next few weeks particularly as people realise the exciting football that weve seen already
7555747 you only have to look at the quality on the field with players such as shannon cole shane smeltz amaral eugene dadi charlie miller joel griffiths and ney fabiano to name just a few
7555748 plus weve got one of australias greats in mark bosnich returning to the competition for the next few weeks
7555749 membership numbers are up more than 20 per cent compared with the same time last year with four clubs setting new personal bests
7555750 as a board weve been really impressed with camerons management credentials his experience in turning a club particularly one like ourselves around
7555751 as we said at the beginning we wanted to have someone with a good business football understanding
7555752 the challenges facing melbourne are severe and if anyone thinks its some sort of cynical means by which we generate a few bob well they might not be watching their footy club go around in how many years time
7555753 im really keen to keep playing one day cricket at least for this summer
7555754 i really enjoy it so providing i can hold my spot i will definitely be playing more one day cricket
7555755 its not like ive played 300 games i came late to one day cricket and have played about 150 161 games
7555756 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7555757 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7555758 in the short term its disappointing but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india
7555759 there have been a lot of distractions lately with the rise of twenty20 cricket but the premium product is still test cricket and one of the premium events is playing india
7555760 ricky is coming along well he came down here yesterday and hit a few balls so i think he is slowly but surely getting there
7555761 any time he is ready to come back we are well and truly waiting for him
7555762 i think all the guys have been in contact with brett whether its been via text or rung him hes pretty busy at the moment with a few things on his plate
7555763 if he needs anybody to talk to im well and truly here
7555764 thats obviously a great result for all the players just to find out whether we are going or not going
7555765 it was ridiculous that we had to ask for private team wallaby stuff to be kept confidential but we did and to oneills credit the damaging leaks stopped occurring
7555766 the worst thing that can happen to the wallabies is for the fans to stop backing the team and that never happened in my experience i dont think it has ever happened
7555767 the next worst thing that can happen is for the front office to stop supporting the team that happened to a degree in 2003
7555768 when rupa advised its members not to sign the pa as it was originally drafted and sought changes through the aru john oneill reacted angrily as if we were trying to sabotage the entire tournament
7555769 eventually we were told we had to sign the pa as it stood by a certain date and if we didnt theyd start the world cup without us
7555770 in response the rupa launched supreme court legal action against the aru seeking orders preventing the aru from approaching its players to sign the pa
7555771 when i put my signature to an affidavit that was part of the rupas court submission in which i stated that oneill had placed undue pressure on the team to sign the pa our relationship was weakened
7555772 overall i would argue he did a very good job but i could never understand why he seemed so happy to promote confrontation
7555773 there are certain parts of the job that didnt appeal to me such as the fact that id be giving up a fair bit of myself
7555774 i knew id have to be careful about what i said knowing there were reporters out there praying for me to say the right thing in the wrong way so they could twist it to suit themselves
7555775 losing the captaincy was a funny thing i think people presumed id be bitter but for me it was more of a blessing in that i was now free of a number of off field commitments
7555776 i knew i wouldnt be captain forever and to have led the wallabies in more than 50 tests was a privilege so it would have been very silly to feel hard done by
7555777 as the media campaign to get rid of me was at its height it was natural for me to think is it all worth it and the answer absolutely was yes
7555778 open tech is for sale this includes all trade secrets and brand equity thank you for tour time
7555779 we cannot handle this there is no way to stop this movement
7555780 i remember sitting in these pews when i was a young boy next to coach and mrs southall they sat with us watched over us and made us act right i am a christian today because coach and mrs southall watched over us in church on sunday night
7555781 you were a sub teacher in my high school when you got us to work you would take out your bible and read it i had never before seen a grown man read a bible it changed my life
7555782 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7555783 we delayed his entry obviously and referred to the blokes who had a background in test rugby with the initial replacement option
7555784 but when timana got into the game he did well that was my first instinct he did really well
7555785 well have a look at the footage and pore over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7555786 theres no doubt he tahu can start a test he is perfectly capable of that as are all of them
7555787 hopefully if i get a spot we can get another good win
7555788 as long as i get a spot in the 22 and we are winning games its all great fun
7555789 i see myself as a 13 but stirling is the captain and he had a great game last saturday
7555790 when i train i learn a lot of roles i trained for fullback this week but i didnt play there i got on the wing i feel comfortable in a lot of positions
7555791 if i can slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline its a bonus for me
7555792 i was pretty happy obviously a bit surprised to get on that early
7555793 i felt i was ready and i got in the game straight away
7555794 ive always enjoyed playing over here i think ive only lost one game in my two years at the force and now australia
7555795 i love playing here ive had nothing but good experiences that win against the springboks was one of the best experiences ive had since i came across to rugby
7555796 iata travel centre was created to reduce the number of passengers with insufficient or incorrect travel documents traditionally this information was provided by airlines and travel agents at time of booking but as more people are booking online this is no longer the case
7555797 it has become a very important destination site for people who want to be sure their travel documents are in order for hassle free travel
7555798 iata travel centre is emblematic of the sites in the travel ad network they drill down very deeply into the travel subjects they cover and provide ideas peer reviews and essential information to assure the best possible travel experience as a result visitors are engaged with content and advertising on these sites far longer than on ota sites
7555799 tripwolf benefits from the general trend towards individually planned trips consumers demand more personalized and genuine travel experiences no longer just cheap flights and hotels
7555800 tripwolf is the perfect tool for independent travelers a one stop shop where users can design their own trip with tips from the tripwolf community and an emphasis on the experiences of their friends on tripwolf travelers are guaranteed to find secret and off the beaten path spots that are generally hard to find on web we are pleased to have them in our network
7555801 travelers with unclear travel plans tend to visit an average of 22 travel sites and 70 percent end up asking friends or relatives for recommendations on tripwolf travelers see immediately which places their friends like
7555802 the travel ad network is perfectly positioned to help advertisers monetize a fragmenting media marketplace where travelers are increasingly relying on the recommendations of people in their social graph for ideas on everything from airlines to hotels to itineraries
7555803 we are very happy for ron and support his decision to work at dundee in an area that has always had great appeal for him
7555804 ron was an excellent president and ceo at verena who demonstrated a tremendous work ethic and professionalism we wish him all the best with his new career
7555805 this is an exciting time in the renewable energy business and we feel fortunate to have teamed up with a visionary company in american alternative energy systems that understands the huge potential of our gasifier to revolutionize the waste to energy sector
7555806 the wte technology represents a significant breakthrough in the way we will destroy troublesome waste streams while producing local renewable energy the focus of the waste to energy sector has evolved over the past few years away from incineration with waste heat recovery towards very efficient low emission gasification systems that produce a combustible gas rather than simply burning the material to generate heat to produce steam
7555807 this relatively low btu syngas works extremely well with the new breed of specialized combined heat and power chp systems and maximizes the overall usage of the stored energy in the waste while minimizing the huge volumes of nox nitrous oxides produced by incineration of waste streams with free flowing air
7555808 we at wte canada see an opportunity to provide a clean inexpensive way of converting the most difficult and noxious waste streams into the maximum possible amount of energy with no impact on the environment except a positive one
7555809 we are very excited to offer such a well rounded comprehensive plan
7555810 offers so many extra health care discounts in addition to dental the plan is likely to pay for itself within the first few months
7555811 the addition of our product to their site should be a great fit we already know that most of the existing traffic on the site has limited insurance which means our plans should be very attractive to the consumer as one of the only multi service healthcare programs on the website we are excited about the distribution opportunity with dentalplans com
7555812 we are pleased with the results of this first shipment and look forward to continued increases in the volume and grade of the concentrates to be shipped to the treatment facility going forward
7555813 our organization is dedicated to helping americans with the belief that we cant offer others what we cant successfully do for ourselves
7555814 the goal is to create a poverty free america one community at a time

7555816 whats unique about our offering is that we host it we manage it and we charge just for its use whether there are just a few or numerous contributors at a low per user cost with no contracts and no strings
7555817 there is an incredible demand today for solutions that help businesses to harness the power of a global work force and the challenges that come with the explosive growth of digital information
7555818 by creating an international network of outstanding creative artists we are building a worldwide reputation for quality and originality offering listeners a wide variety of world fusion music we celebrate roney giahs arrival on astranova
7555819 spain has taken a leadership position in promoting solar power and were excited about the opportunity to sell our cpv products and trackers into this exciting market i look forward to reporting on our progress with this initiative in the near future
7555820 i firmly believe the key to improving quality is having nurses at the bedside our current practice has created diversions that pull nurses from consistent bedside nursing
7555821 i was thrilled to learn about vhas rapid adoption network our participation in this initiative has opened a door of networking for our staff that is invaluable
7555822 vhas clinical improvement platform focuses on helping members become leading performers
7555823 our programs and services will help guide members towards success and improve clinical care across the country
7555824 hospitals are working hard to improve the quality and safety of their nursing care return to care is one critical strategy to help them do so
7555825 by focusing on nursing issues we are having an immediate impact on the quality of care that is delivered to all patients
7555826 certification programs of the americas and their position at a global level
7555827 green globe has been the premier 3rd party certification program for the tourism industry and as the owner of the brand worldwide green globe international looks forward to participating with the stsc
7555828 green globe international will continue to advocate for the most stringent accreditation process possible in order to maintain the credibility of global tourism certification programs worldwide
7555829 management is preparing for what we believe will be the signing of the first initial agreement for green globe internationals comprehensive sustainability and carbon neutrality plans scnp for tourism destinations and mr cox will play an important role in the strategic planning process
7555830 we also expect to meet with additional potential corporate partners who wish to align themselves with the green globe brand and we expect to report any developments that result from these meetings as soon as possible
7555831 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year

7555833 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
7555834 theyll touch my hand and theres all this physical contact or theyll run around in their pajamas
7555835 i was painting the hallway right outside a clients bedroom and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them asking me if i had a girlfriend
7555836 its all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough hewn construction guy

7555845 i think that the new allegations have been significantly presented to the police by witnesses who have less than strong credibility
7555846 because they are people who are from what i understand either drug addicts theyve been in and out of jail on parole
7555847 its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more

7555850 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7555851 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7555852 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7555853 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7555854 os advers rios t m que temer o santos e precisamos mostrar que somos uma grande equipe quando assumi o time percebi que esse medo tinha acabado mas isso agora mudou

7555866 under this agreement petrohunter expects to receive approximately 64 25 million subject to falcon exercising its option on our buckskin properties importantly it will help resolve our liquidity problem and transform petrohunter energy corporation into a viable company with a solid future which has been our goal for the past year
7555867 after we completed the sale of our southern piceance properties to laramie energy in may of this year we significantly improved our balance sheet but we still needed working capital to execute our drilling and development plans the falcon transaction will enable petrohunter to become current on all of its trade obligations restructure the amount owed to our senior lender move forward on completing our five buckskin wells and finance further drilling and development on this 20 000 acre project including construction of the gathering system and related facilities
7555868 we also welcome falcons participation with us in australia where weve identified multiple prospects
7555869 where was the original town hall of york located in the 1700s
7555870 there are some 180 000 private military contractors performing functions that once would have been handled by soldiers in uniform
7555871 we are experiencing an extremely turbulent time in the housing market millions of consumers are turning to trulia to make informed real estate decisions
7555872 at trulia our mission is to deliver unique local insight to consumers when they want it how they want it and where they want it todays launch is a big step in this direction
7555873 this is the most luminous and therefore probably the most massive discovered at this epoch
7555874 the light we observe started about 7 7 billion years ago this is about half of the so it is from quite long ago and quite far away
7555875 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7555876 the fact that we do find these clusters is a clear confirmation of dark energy
7555877 this was a very long time ago and its actually about as massive as the most massive ones we observe today without dark energy we would observe much more massive clusters and many more of these massive clusters than we actually do
7555878 dieses erkenntnis ist sehr erfreulich und f r mich nicht berraschend
7555879 im anlassfall kann daher von einer freiwilligkeit des weiteren handelns der beschwerdef hrer nicht gesprochen werden
7555880 and if our european tour had played better here at home she might have been the pick
7555881 we needed the foreign policy on the bottom of the ticket more than we want to admit
7555882 we have enough problems with them as it is putting sebelius on the bottom of the ticket would have been another stick in the eye

7555915 when senator obama positioned himself as the prophet of a new kind of politics he energized millions of young people and even older republicans and people who had become so cynical about politics that they have not voted in recent years but that depended on him being the voice of peace against war social justice against capitulation to the rich and the large corporations and ecological sanity if he now moves to what the inside the beltway crowd call the center he ends up in an election campaign in which he will be trying to prove that he is a better general for wartime than mccain and a better mini manager of the same old system and that will undermine the hopefulness that was the ticket to his political success and the republicans will become republicans again the youth and the cynics will return to their other concerns and obamas political possibilities will be worse not better

7556055 the essence of intelligence is skill in extracting meaning from everyday experience
7556056 meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with
7556057 our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive indifferent life
7556058 what we see depends mainly on what we look for

7556100 if more states would publish breach notification lists there would be more information to study and to help us understand this growing concern
7556101 at this time only three states publish such information additionally more companies are starting to audit their security and network systems and use readily available security measures this pro active approach means that breaches are being identified that might otherwise have gone undetected
7556102 the number of attacks in addition to publicly disclosed breaches continues to escalate as criminal networks mushroom around the world while economies weaken
7556103 a more concerted effort is required among companies to secure and protect customer data regardless of regulatory oversight
7556104 these two cases highlight our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information unsecured networks are a friendly target for such groups additionally insider theft data on the move and inadvertent posting of personal information to web sites add to the problem breaches are not simply the result of malicious attacks but also of human error and poor information handling procedures
7556105 it is critical that law enforcement governmental agencies businesses consumers and legislators understand the causes of breaches with this in mind the itrc has continued to create new database tools to better analyze breach information when we understand how data is exposed or stolen we can avert many breaches because of improved security procedures and safer information handling

7556165 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7556166 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7556167 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7556192 to work with corn in mexico is to enter a historic cultural political and economic world thats very complex something like how they talk about grapes in france
7556193 in philly i was working in cool restaurants along with nice people earning good money at alma de cuba sometimes i had eggs with a little salmon for breakfast now im working in the dust with animals eating corn tortillas and chilies as lunch but i decided to come back to see what i can do for my family and my community from here
7556194 is to help a few farmers market their product differently
7556195 a lot of third world development discourse is grow this grow that but the people of san mateo already know how to grow corn and since we dont have the power to overturn nafta which 99 9 percent of the time works against the community we can turn it into an advantage
7556196 for example with fair trade coffee from chiapas they give the growers a decent exchange rate but the buyer makes most of the money the cool thing about this project is its transnational wherever the money is made it stays in the community because they live here and in mexico
7556197 if you ask people from the north of mexico they probably will not know it only people from puebla oaxaca chiapas the areas with more tradition even in mexico city you wont see this
7556198 its like if you go to mexico city and find someone selling scrapple when i found out peter bloom was selling pinole i thought cool were a mexican restaurant i want to make something with it
7556199 it was a busy time of the evening and there were many young people in the
7556200 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is indeed tragic
7556201 though i think in a few years there will be a dance space because there are so many people in the community trying to make it happen
7556202 if you want to make art you make it any way you can
7556203 if youre not being presented at a certain moment its like screw it ill do it in my living room or in a warehouse or in the street theres been tons of that going on philadelphia for years thats the big thing working with whats in front of you instead of waiting for someone to present you
7556204 thats one of the amazing things about fringe founder and director nick stuccio and the fringe festival
7556205 sometimes they act as if theyre invisible even though theyre not
7556206 its about what people become when they get into their cars
7556207 we generally did two to three rehearsals a week but since june were in lockdown mode ive been rehearsing with two full casts so i rehearse three hours with one cast then three hours with the other cast at least a few days a week
7556208 then there are weeks that we have intensives and work every day
7556209 to be honest i had done a lot of dance pieces and they left a funky taste in my mouth
7556210 my issue is and people have said this to me that a lot of people have done it and everyone always feels like its an afterthought and it looks that way too
7556211 im really proud of that we work really hard on it
7556212 its more like shes doing a site specific dance piece within the video pieces that ive designed for the space thats why theyre so good
7556213 the goal is to make anonymous bodies a small core of dancers that i can have on salary it can be a full time company but i just dont have the financial wherewithal to give everyone full time jobs right now
7556214 but those are my peeps theyre my support system who make it happen
7556215 i think it has a lot to do with wanting audiences physically closer to the work and have a different experience
7556216 to not just sit but walk around the city go on a subway to experience performances in such a way that they arent just sitting and watching philadelphia artists are constantly pushing their audiences to see art in other ways
7556217 shes one of a bunch of artists in the city here whos been really investigating immersing the audience sort of participating rather than just spectating
7556218 thats a big thing nationally and internationally in the performance world i think her work is on the forefront of that
7556219 when you go to see her pieces it just feels really relevant that whats going on taps into our world and our lives thats not true for a lot of dance and even a lot of dance that i make
7556220 and thats not a bad thing often dance can be really esoteric and thats what can be so beautiful about it
7556221 you can make a site specific piece but still have the audience sitting there passively in seats quietly shes really changing the role of the audience it is a site specific piece but also more than that
7556222 it was always clear to me that kate had both strong performance presence and also strong creative ability which is what i look for in my group motion dancers in general but she emerged as someone with her own very particular voice
7556223 the fact that she has entered into site specific work doesnt surprise me she was always very interested in the juncture between art performance and real life
7556224 she was able to show she was making interesting and sophisticated decisions in her work
7556225 and shes so young and the potential in a young artist is always exciting for a panel but kate also seemed to have a certain control and awareness
7556226 listen guys there was some drinking of water and some shifting around youre equidistant from us at that point we can see you youve got to remember that its all a stage

7556240 i never look for steve to wrestle again but as i have said regarding this mattter many times i hope that i am wrong as far as creating revenue no wrestler that i know has ever generated more money than austin in a given year does that make steve the all time best some would say yes
7556241 i have always thought that gail kim was talented and wrote when she left the wwe a couple of years ago that i thought she should have stayed she has improved her in ring work and her interview skills over the past couple of years and if she does officially return to the wwe i feel she will ease right into the mix with the other divas her exotic look and her overall skill set should lend to her marketability

7556302 few people can talk as effectively about middle americas economic concerns as bill clinton
7556303 has two major challenges this week and both are hillary centric
7556304 occupy the space on the political spectrum that hillary carved out
7556305 while obama can continue to try to reassure resistant clinton loyalists in appalachia that hes not a bogeyman from madrassaland he must also move on to the bigger picture for everyone else
7556306 is designed to stoke the resentment of wavering clinton voters and to make sure the clinton controversy remains part of the convention storyline

7556308 run an ad mocking his opponent for not choosing a particular running mate
7556309 an attack ad this transparent will be just the thing to finally get all those ex hillary supporters fully on board with obama

7556547 my husband could black my eye so me and the kid could go to a battered womans shelter
7556548 you dont put up any more barriers for victims wanting to enter the shelter
7556549 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse
7556550 were just gaming the system all they had to do was make up some tale about some man abusing them no proof needed and they could stay up to 2 months at the shelter
7556551 free hostel for women with emotional problems if they are willing to hate their husbands enough and are willing to take out protective orders against their husbands
7556552 after hours some of these women would sneak men into their rooms the same men who had supposedly abused them

7556590 one day kevin invited a bunch of guys over for a poker game and he said hey my little sister wants to play do you mind and they all thought what a cute kid sure and so i played and cleaned up
7556591 it was the first time i realized that being a girl in a guys game has an advantage men underestimate me
7556592 so are you going to be rude to me too
7556593 so were you being the absent minded professor for a minute there looked like you are on a mental vacation
7556594 i was just remembering something i would like to do while i am here
7556595 well i hope it is fun daydreaming about work is a little strange if you as me
7556596 you are in room 1536 it should give you a nice view of the city
7556597 if you need anything just let us let me know
7556598 you should have seen the way he was looking at you especially when you were bent over the file cabinet
7556599 i thought he was going to jump over the counter and take you right here he had that look in his eyes you know what i mean
7556600 boy you two really were distracting each other werent you
7556601 hey dont forget that you were going to have dinner with us after the other shift comes on of course you could always invite him to come along
7556602 oh please i am just going to return a credit card
7556603 if you are not back in fifteen minutes i am going to come up and join the fun
7556604 i have not felt this way about a woman for years
7556605 hi dr anderson this is jennie at the desk downstairs
7556606 good i have your credit card at the desk and i was planning to bring it up to you is this a convenient time
7556607 oh god sorry i forgot to get it from you dont trouble yourself i can come down to get it
7556608 no i am going to return it to you if you do not mind
7556609 i could not remember if this room was one of the newly refurbished ones after having to wait in line behind those snobs at the desk i thought you should deserve a little reward
7556610 of course but i am the manager and i can do anything i want
7556611 i was going to say that i would like to see you non professionally while i am in town for the next few days could we do dinner sometime
7556612 arent you afraid of being seen with some hotel wench by your academic colleagues
7556613 dinner with you is far more interesting to me than dinner with academics
7556614 i was going to ask you the same thing actually i am eating with some of my desk workers in half an hour at the bar and grille place across the sky walk we get a good discount does that sound ok
7556615 is go to meetings and have lunches and dinners with colleagues
7556616 well i have to be around at least but not at the desk every minute
7556617 i told you i was thinking about something fun and well i was thinking about you actually and
7556618 i was fantasizing about you actually and about having sex with you
7556619 so what are the rules about employees having encounters with guests in their rooms
7556620 hmmm none that i know of but if there were i think they should be changed
7556621 we think that the crisis has forced our government to pay attention to local rice production which has been neglected for so long
7556622 i have never seen this kind of price hike in 30 years
7556623 just a few months ago 1 kilogram of paddy unhulled rice was selling here for 110 cfa francs 0 27 and now it is 225 cfa francs 0 56
7556624 in its latest review of the global metals market for fortis bank uk economic research group virtual metals notes that metals had a torrid time in july and early august as concerns about demand being hit by a combination of higher prices and slowing economies have taken centre stage
7556625 given the fact that the us economy is far from being out of the woods
7556626 the abrupt recovery in the dollar can only be explained by a widening investment view that america may offer the least worst haven right now whatever the wisdom of that attitude the higher dollar has also knocked metals back probably to levels at which buying certainly in gold given that inflation remains a threat everywhere might return rather sooner than later
7556627 where would the price be if they etf investors sold
7556628 i have not ceased being fearful but i have ceased to let fear control me
7556629 right now they are being marketed very successfully by water bottlers as a convenience but that convenience in carrying it around is actually an inconvenience to our environment and its a waste
7556630 its not as easy or as convenient to use municipal water in this old building so weve got just a great opportunity with the new city hall to set the standard there
7556631 our community is unique in that the water bottles that we buy in the store literally do come from the same aquifer that were taking our tap water from but were paying more than the price of gasoline for something that we get for free right out of our tap
7556632 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7556633 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7556634 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7556635 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7556636 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7556637 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7556638 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7556639 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7556640 i was just trying to help out the best i could
7556641 ive learned that if you actually take action then someone might listen to you
7556642 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7556643 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7556644 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7556645 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7556646 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7556647 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7556648 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7556649 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7556690 memory operated at room temperature and with only a single layer quantum dot layer is important because it can be used in every day life
7556691 room temperature memory operation of a single inas quantum dot layer in a gaas algaas heterostructure
7556692 low temperatures were needed with single layer quantum dot our idea was to create a system that could work under increased temperatures otherwise you always have to put your samples in cryostats and use long wirings this makes it harder to extract all the information you want
7556693 from this structure field emission is reduced drastically and we are able to observe the memory effect at room temperature
7556694 the trick here is that the material does not match directly to the gallium arsenide you do not have to structure them
7556695 you cannot say in a lateral field where they are placed
7556696 through etching making small holes at pre defined sites it turns out that indium arsenide growth can be controlled laterally
7556697 others have been working on this and we would like to see our method combined with this lateral positioning that is being studied
7556698 this field of quantum dots is being intensely studied right now
7556699 for use in quantum computers and sensors quantum cryptography is another field that would benefit from this work it is also interesting for optical electronics our work may sever as an inter connect for different applications
7556700 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7556701 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7556702 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7556703 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7556704 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7556706 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7556707 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7556708 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7556709 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug

7556748 its different for me i have someone there running things whom i trust
7556749 i am ready to discuss anything with her all issues raised by her party can be discusssed at the highest level
7556750 as a responsible opposition leader you must appreciate that the quick implementation of the tata motors project is very important for the state you must be wanting that this project is implemented in this state
7556751 we are facing a critical situation when many other states have offered the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur which we cannot not afford to lose
7556752 we are ready to join a discussion but land should be returned first
7556753 if he bhattacharjee really wants a solution he should return 400 acre and enable the tata plant to come up on 600 acre without making it an ego issue
7556754 alternate land of 500 acre is lying nearby with the cpi m backed promoters where the vendor park of the tata motors can be relocated
7556755 what can we do if she rejects it she is opposing for the sake of opposition
7556756 at that time there were no victim rights and somebody had to witness an act of violence in order to prosecute it
7556757 the criminal justice system lacked information and training on the dynamics of domestic violence and its effects on the family

7556760 in a new cnn opinion research corporation poll out sunday night 47 percent of those questioned are backing obama with an equal amount supporting the arizona senator
7556761 this month after his rock star world tour before 200 000 people in berlin and after picking as his running mate democratic sen joe biden obama is now tied with mccain
7556762 obama biden 08 going nowhere fast post announcement poll shows biden choice sucking whatever life was left out of obama s campaign
7556763 not only has biden not helped obama it looks like he s actually damaging the ticket with his addition he certainly hasn t added any enthusiasm to the democratic offering
7556764 the real hillary supporters are mad obama s decision to put forth absolutely no effort to vet her would an hour meeting and a request for documents have killed them after suggesting she would be on anyone s short list stings
7556765 how insane it is that nominees have to contest 50 grueling primaries caucuses to win the nomination but the next in line to the throne if they re elected is chosen purely on their own say so if the wisdom of democratic voters is trustworthy enough to pick the top half of the ticket superdelegates notwithstanding why isn t it trustworthy enough to pick the bottom half
7556766 obama did not optimize his chances for winning in november when he chose not to choose hillary clinton all the whining and complaining about pumas is not going to help that
7556767 the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7556768 a strong line of inquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7556769 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children
7556770 quick incremental updates along with heavy user involvement are key characteristics of an emerging software development paradigm championed by a new generation of web 2 0 start ups
7556771 the deployment of section 527 groups as the new vehicle for using soft money to conduct political activities to influence federal elections is simply the latest chapter in a long history of efforts to evade and violate the federal campaign finance laws
7556772 a high number of wrong time errors is not surprising and given the lack of clinical significance of the errors observed is probably not a meaningful indicator of quality
7556773 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7556774 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7556775 moreover limelights slowing revenue growth lack of profitability heightened content delivery network rivalry and emerging competitive threats add to our uneasiness with the stock
7556776 more clarity on these legal matters or at the very least greater conviction that limelights profit outlook is improving
7556777 they got away with it because president carter didnt want to buy anything he was very interested in innovation as long as it didnt require purchasing military equipment
7556778 reversibility of metabolic syndrome depends more on the percentage of excess weight lost than on other clinical or demographic characteristics
7556779 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment
7556780 this represents a 67 percent survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7556781 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
7556782 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7556783 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7556784 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7556800 its terrible that this has happened and i think its due to neglect you shouldnt have guns around young children
7556801 the police have been to question all the neighbours i saw the ambulance arrive and that was the first i heard about it i saw the family quite often and they are quite quiet the rumour is that it was the little girl one of his sisters who pulled the trigger by accident
7556802 there are four people who live there and theyve got two or three of kids
7556803 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle
7556804 i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7556805 they are a nice family and are no trouble to anyone at all the little boy who was shot was a lovely boy
7556806 the family are very upset but it was a complete accident they dont want to talk to anyone
7556807 we were called to an address in washwood heath in birmingham at around 6 40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot he had suffered a serious head injury

7556834 proyectar una imagen de modernidad mantener limpieza y orden crear seguridad y poner en marcha espacios tan incompatibles como un puerto y una ciudad
7556835 nos han dicho que el puerto estaba de espaldas al mar
7556836 muchos a os de constante crecimiento de espa a estamos viviendo una poca diferente
7556837 el coraz n de la comunitat tiene que seguir palpitando fuerte al ritmo que le hemos puesto durante estos ltimos a os de crecimiento
7556838 es una sociedad moderna que aspira a tener un espacio grande en la historia de espa a y en la de europa
7556839 son un tir n indispensable para un sector estrat gico como es el tur stico

7556852 ahora tenemos previsto despejar las gradas de la calle j j domine y las que estan enfrente de los tinglados para que toda esta zona vuelva a la normalidad
7556853 si no hay ning n tipo de problema esto ocurrir durante los primeros d as de septiembre
7556854 se ha tomado buena nota para seguir mejorando el a o que viene
7556855 incremente el prestigio conseguido por el gran premio en su primera edici n ya que
7556856 200 operarios adicionales y 120 equipos mec nicos han trabajado d a y noche en los accesos al circuito en aquellas zonas donde se encuentran los monumentos m s visitados de la ciudad y en el entorno del valencia street circuit
7556857 estos son los datos concretos relacionados con la semana cr tica del plan de seguridad un dispositivo que ya se estableci a principios del mes de julio
7556858 desde el momento en el que se puso en marcha se han realizado un gran n mero de actuaciones muy visibles que han servido como elemento disuasorio
7556859 no se ha realizado ninguna actuaci n que pusiera en peligro la seguridad ciudadana
7556860 durante toda esta semana y semanas previas se han llevado a cabo todo tipo de controles de hoteles de campings de lugares de acceso y de carreteras entre otros puntos trabajo preventivo que ha servido de elemento disuasorio
7556861 importante despliegue tanto cualitativo como cuantitativo previsto de las fuerzas de seguridad
7556862 gran compromiso esfuerzo y profesionalidad de los miles de agentes que en l han participado
7556863 que se maximicen los resultados positivos por parte de todas las administraciones
7556864 la protecci n de todas las personalidades asistentes a la competici n garantizar la seguridad en toda la ciudad y de todos los ciudadano o velar por las instalaciones
7556865 se han llevado a cabo actuaciones en los m s distintos mbitos ya que la concentraci n de centenares de miles de personas conllevaba importantes exigencias de control de tr fico de control e identificaci n de personas y una serie de actuaciones que nos han permitido que podamos decir con rotundidad que la ejecuci n del plan de seguridad ha sido magn fica
7556866 comprando energ a a los pa ses que s que se lo han planteado
7556867 otra limitaci n muy importante que es la del tratamiento de resiudos
7556868 aprobaron crear un almacen central temporal para estos residuos pero resulta dif cil decidir la ubicaci n
7556869 complicado abrir el debate cuando no hay candidatos ni para ubicar nuevas centrales ni para este almacen central de residuos
7556870 un modelo energ tico que garantice el suministro que necesita la econom a espa ola basado en las energ as renovables e independiente de las reservas naturales
7556871 democratizan el suministro energ tico ya que favorece que las medianas empresas construyan las instalaciones
7556872 las centrales nucleares precisan de un per odo de inversi n y ejecuci n largo en el tiempo y muy costoso lo que conlleva que s lo las grandes empresas el ctricas sean capaces de abordarlo
7556873 de hecho somos el segundo productor mundial de energ a e lica y aspiramos a ser el primero en energ a solar y fotov taica
7556874 s lo complica m s el dif cil entramado dentro de las filas socialistas para encauzar a un partido que respira en clave de fracaso
7556875 intentan hacer algo en el desaguisado que tienen dentro de su partido el gobierno valenciano y el ppcv ponen toda la carne en el asador para defender los intereses de los valencianos
7556876 haya esperado hasta el ltimo minuto para dar a conocer sus verdaderas intenciones mientras el socialismo valenciano se derrumba a cada paso
7556877 abren la caja de pandora en el pspv con su dec logo de candidatos el socialismo valenciano se define como un partido estancado sin ideas y lleno de contradicciones que poco aportan al desarrollo de la comunitat
7556878 candidatos a pilotar el pspv que aporten ideas y no disgustos a los valencianos ya que desde hace a os s lo han acumulado fracasos y m s fracasos para la comunitat
7556879 si se tiene en cuenta la premura con la que se ha hecho todo
7556880 hay que trabajar con el tiempo suficiente porque no siempre el resultado se dar como en este caso
7556881 se ha hecho un s per esfuerzo por parte de todos
7556882 m s importante es que se saben d nde est n y c mo solucionarlas por parte de la organizaci n y por parte de la federaci n espa ola
7556883 ya se tuvo una conversi n con los organizadores porque empez la cuenta atr s para el segundo gp de europa
7556884 hacer un balance y empezar a trabajar en las soluciones
7556885 muy poco de urbano es un circuito ocasional con las medidas de seguridad de un circuito permanente pero que est ubicado en una ciudad
7556886 lo que m s me importaba es que fuera una circuito seguro para los pilotos y para el p blico porque adem s se puede adelantar y se puede dar espect culo
7556887 fr a a la grada por lo que respecta a la afici n espa ola
7556888 no se dio una carrera vistosa fue un tanto aburrida pero eso no se puede solucionar
7556889 cuando llegu a la direcci n de carrera ya hab a tenido el accidente
7556890 s que alonso est sufriendo este a o por los problemas del renault y tambi n por la afici n porque un gran porcentaje de los que estuvieron en valencia les gusta la f rmula 1 con fernando alonso
7556891 they wanted to enter europe in a big way and probably this is the reason why they have paid a higher premium
7556892 its a positive sign for the company because they were sitting on a huge cash pile and it was not generating any return
7556893 the objective is to create a leading global sap services provider
7556894 there is strong demand for these sevices and this will allow us to leverage the capabilities and strengths of both to have global reach scale and financial strength to participate in deals that are large
7556895 our stated policy is to move up the value chain move into the consultancy space
7556896 we have already made a lot of investments in this space and this is a continuation of that policy
7556897 si sigue en vigor la oferta de consenso que l mismo hizo en les corts valencianes el pasado mes de julio o por el contrario ahora predominan las declaraciones de los portavoces del pp
7556898 ha quedado evidente que tienen como objetivo la confrontaci n y la oposici n una vez m s al gobierno de espa a en lugar de buscar el consenso para encontrar el mejor modelo de financiaci n que es lo que los socialitas queremos
7556899 hemos dicho alto y claro que buscamos el mejor modelo de financiaci n para los valencianos
7556900 siempre hemos apostado por un acuerdo de todas las fuerzas pol ticas de la comunitat
7556901 ya consider negativo para los valencianos el actual sistema y lo dijimos en 2001 2002 y 2003 no nos ha hecho falta que cambiara el gobierno de madrid para decirlo algo que si le ha costado reconocer al pp
7556902 al consell del pp le ha costado m s pero parec a que por fin estaba dispuesto a sentarse con los socialistas para encontrar un bueno modelo
7556903 de primera mano las ltimas novedades acerca de las oportunidades sectoriales
7556904 para hacer m s gil la inscripci n en estos encuentros
7556905 thank you for doing this for a long time i have been wondering about these awards since i have had some pretty disappointing experiences with wine lists all over the country in restaurants i had chosen because of the award of excellence
7556906 any other decent publication would fire their editor over an incident like this what happened to journalistic integrity
7556907 durante este fin de semana en el que se ha celebrado el
7556908 no s lo el nivel de ocupaci n es excelente
7556909 como este evento atrae a gente con un alto poder adquisitivo tambi n se ha producido una gran repercusi n en el precio medio
7556910 los hoteles de cinco estrellas han registrado una gran ocupaci n y aunque los de una estrella tambi n han estado completos los mejores precios se han obtenido l gicamente en los primeros
7556911 algunos clientes antes de marcharse ya han reservado su habitaci n para asistir a la celebraci n del pr ximo gran premio de europa en valencia ya que saben que es un evento multitudinario y que tiene muchos seguidores entre la gente de alto poder adquisitivo
7556912 para la industria hotelera este evento roza lo excepcional y consigue una promoci n de la ciudad important sima
7556913 llegado a donde zapatero no quiere o no sabe llegar y paliendo las ineficacias de un gobierno que condena al perpetuo olvido a nuestra tierra
7556914 nunca nos cansaremos de reivindicar que los cinco millones de valencianos que somos cuenten para un gobierno que olvida a uno de cada cinco
7556915 se lo debemos a los cinco millones de personas que tienen que renunciar a parte de sus derechos educativos o de asistencia sanitaria para financiar a un mill n de personas que no cuentan
7556916 es el nico partido que se preocupa por los problemas reales que nos afectan y que reivindica un trato equitativo y justo para los valencianos
7556917 que no ha hecho nada ni siquiera protestar por el trato privilegiado que zapatero da a otras comunidades aut nomas
7556918 no sabe salir del lodazal de la financiaci n en que se ha metido
7556919 echa a los leones del congreso de los diputados a su vicepresidente
7556920 damos como los que m s pero no queremos recibir como los que menos
7556921 m s del doble de lo que han aumentado en la comunitat
7556922 nos nos perjudica en absoluto que el nuevo sistema de financiaci n tenga en cuenta
7556923 nos dice que ya sabe cu l es la poblaci n de la comunitat que conoce las estad sticas pero lo que no sabe es actuar en consecuencia y darnos lo que nos corresponde por lo que su actitud es a n peor del que sin saber yerra
7556924 tendi la mano a los socialistas y parece que el portavoz del pspv se la cogi
7556925 bueno para todos porque la uni n siempre hace la fuerza
7556926 nunca dejaremos de pedir que se nos trate igual que al resto
7556927 trato discriminatorio para la comunitat o privilegiado para otras lo denunciaremos y reclamaremos lo que nos corresponda
7556928 somos la comunidad que m s compartimos con el resto
7556929 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show

7556932 an estimated 15 000 backers of the measure most of them members of mormon catholic and evangelical christian churches knocked on doors and distributed campaign literature to registered voters throughout the state this weekend and last according to jennifer kerns spokeswoman for the yes on 8 campaign
7556933 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok
7556934 russia may deny its help to the united states in resolving some major problems for instance the one with iran
7556935 we keep insisting in talks with the russian authorities on the importance of a fast withdrawal of troops from the poti senaki highway the area adjacent to abkhazia and on the necessity to observe the fifth principle of the agreement between the russian and french presidents
7556936 return of the russian armed forces to the line preceding the start of hostilities
7556937 the poti port is a vitally important organ for georgian economys normal operation
7556938 independence and territorial integrity of georgia in its internationally recognized borders
7556939 inne kraje b d pr bowa y ukra nam szkoleniowc w po sukcesach w pekinie ca y wiat patrzy na davea brailsforda ojca sukces w w kolarstwie
7556940 is not trying to orchestrate the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia by other countries
7556941 by recognizing the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we will violate the principle of the territorial integrity of georgia as a sovereign state
7556942 in addition there is a un security council resolution on abkhazia stipulating that the settlement of the conflict must not violate georgias territorial integrity if tbilisi brings the case to court the verdict will not go in russias favor
7556943 russian diplomacy recognizes the right of nations to self determination but not to secession which is possible only if the state has committed crimes against an ethnic group
7556944 russia did not recognize the act of genocide by serbs in kosovo but it may use the argument
7556945 this would suit russia because they would appeal for admission not to moscow but to the union state
7556946 king abdullah has serious problems he knows that if the united states jordans main ally decides to re carve the middle east jordan will be the first victim of that plan
7556947 this will be a major blow for the u s because before the storming of tskhinvali the u s foreign policy was based on the assumption that russia was not a serious player
7556948 however now russia has joined the molding of geopolitical realities
7556949 our immediate goal now is to promote ties with iran and pakistan
7556950 it is a serious political error the reason is russian authorities surprising lack of confidence and failure to understand the current state of society and its own long term goals
7556951 some of our political generals continue to wage war in the deep rear of their own policies an old war which has long been won its a habit stereotype thinking the government isnt ready for modernization modernization goals are very different from restoration of statehood on this path one faces new enemies and new complicated problems
7556952 the lobbyists for khodorkovskys release werent active enough so they didnt gain much
7556953 coming immediately after the armed conflict in south ossetia khodorkovskys release would have looked as a concession something undesirable amid russias current confrontation with the west still the idea hasnt been dropped altogether
7556954 khodorkovskys release would have been a challenge to the system of priorities established by former president vladimir putin it would have meant an end to putins era and a beginning of some other one
7556955 putin has established a simple discussion rule within the political elite the strongest one is always right in a different set of rules the former tycoons release would have meant compassion mercy or humanity in putin view it means weakness
7556956 if he released khodorkovsky it means he succumbed to pressure from someone possibly from george bush therefore the mere mention of khodorkovskys release only sparks irritation in putin who sees it as a form of pressure on himself

7556998 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7556999 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7557000 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7557001 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression of the thirties and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7557002 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7557003 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better
7557004 very much one of financial caution as regards the next year
7557005 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7557006 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels

7557013 i think were going to see a lot of that satire on the fringe next year

7557037 it is a relief because usually in these situations it comes down to the players at the last minute to make the decision
7557038 however in this case the ecb and the icc have come up with the sensible decision a lot can happen between now and then but at the moment the concerns were the security there

7557045 first class facilities first class organization that is what is being said about the games in beijing
7557046 but it was also noticeable that china did not do as well when it comes to human rights press freedom and democratization
7557047 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7557048 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home

7557080 a weaker economy is likely to bring inflation under control in the medium term
7557081 if you talk to warren buffett hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end

7557100 the current funding for sport is partly driven by lottery and gaming revenue which is also used to fund essential services like hospitals schools police and transport

7557102 i dont accept the view put forward by critics of our olympians who produced outstanding results and were cheered day and night

7557118 the world is losing the war i think at the moment the taliban definitely has the upper hand
7557119 this organisation is a terrorist organisation and has created mayhem against public life
7557120 the facts are pretty plain the deals across the border have led to a significant rise in insurgent activities here in afghanistan we know where these guys are being trained and armed to be sent to afghanistan to kill civilians and afghan and coalition troops this is obviously a political hot potato but we would be failing in our duty if we did not seek to counter this
7557121 i can only echo what president bush told the visiting pakistanis the other day that in effect information we share with them seems to end up with the bad guys
7557122 the us is now losing the war against the taliban pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has made it a major threat to us strategic interests

7557140 yahoo s valuation includes a large component for the value of these overseas investments of approximately 8 71 share at the end of 2q 08 under our pessimistic scenario in which the dollar appreciates by a further 10 this contribution to value would be reduced directly by 0 87 to 7 84 share
7557141 another important factor is that the exchange rate impact on operating margins is its asymmetry for a company with 20 percent operating margins 10 percent depreciation in the dollar would give a 182 basis point gain in reported operating margins however 10 percent appreciation in the dollar would cause a 222 basis point fall in reported operating margins this phenomenon happens because more of the companys costs are us centric and this causes the asymmetry as the magnitudes of the overseas costs and revenues are impacted to a different extent by the dollar exchange rate

7557153 we provide many unusual benefits for our employees including meals free of charge we are careful to consider the long term advantages to the company of these benefits expect us to add benefits rather than pare then down over time we believe it is easy to be penny wise and pound foolish with respect to benefits that can save employees considerable time and improve their health and productivity

7557156 youve got a public that on some level has a complex mix of views on this subject admiring of women admiring of traits that they associate with leadership but not yet admiring of women in top leadership roles

7557179 i think its really close to miraculous when you think about what the structure was to begin with and the amount of work thats happened over the last eight months to really transform it for use
7557180 this is clearly a slip form utilitarian structure using mid 20th century technology
7557181 the design intent was to respect that simple character and the exterior accommodations to allow light to get into the structure have been done in the simplest manner to keep it as close as they could to its original appearance
7557182 it was built in 1939 and theres no deterioration to the concrete whatsoever a lot of interior had to be removed

7557218 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever known
7557219 its kind of counterintuitive because people think of the elderly as having a weak immune system

7557266 since obama clinched the nomination its official thursday after the roll call his campaign has become more conventional
7557267 obama has had a change of heart on offshore oil drilling opted out of public financing angered his activist base by backing a foreign intelligence surveillance law and demonstrated he indeed has the stomach to approve negative ads
7557268 he made a set of compromises all in a row that freaked people out on the progressive side of the party said robert borosage co director of the campaign for americas future
7557269 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7557270 long before a little boy was crushed and killed by a falling gate at a public housing project on the near north side inspectors repeatedly warned the chicago housing authority that gates around the development were a problem federal reports show
7557271 six months later 3 year old curtis cooper died when one of the massive metal gates fell on him a lawyer for the boys family has alleged that the gate was dangling by one hinge because the two others had rusted through
7557272 after being alerted to the problem its not clear what steps if any the cha took to get the politically connected firm managing the cabrini green rowhouses to fix the gates urban property advisors or upa is run by the son of developer allison davis one of mayor richard daleys top allies in the african american community
7557273 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
7557274 the deal included 855 000 in development fees for rezko and his partner allison s davis obamas former boss according to records from the project which was four blocks outside obamas state senate district
7557275 mayor richard daley and the city council have forced city workers to take as many as five unpaid days off in the last two years but the mayor and most aldermen have not shared in the hardship
7557276 quite honestly it was an oversight on the part of staff who forgot to remind him to take days off
7557277 senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times
7557278 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7557279 joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there
7557280 if you can reach back into history youll find quotes
7557281 you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other
7557282 gibbs rejected the notion that obama advertisements attacking mccain over the fact that he could not recall in an interview how many houses he owns is an example of the slash and burn politics he once said he would reject
7557283 its a legitimate issue he either forgot how many he has or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters gibbs said youre out of touch if you have seven houses and dont even remember
7557284 kaine who was also on obamas shortlist said on fox that biden would still help obama win votes in his state since he comes from a state delaware that borders virginia
7557285 biden asked mr mccain in 2004 to leave his party and be the running mate for senator john kerry
7557286 kstreetprojector and atrios have both pointed to one of the things liberals should really be cheering about joe biden being on the democratic ticket the man is one of amtraks biggest supporters
7557287 biden commutes to work each day on amtrak and has been a strong supporter of the beleaguered rail service
7557288 biden has been particularly concerned with rail passenger security and has in the words of communications director norm kurz worked furiously to secure funding for amtrak to upgrade its tunnels hire more cops and bomb sniffing dogs build more fences and add lighting to terminals
7557289 amtrak president george warrington presented biden with a champion of the rails award in june 2001 and the american passenger rail coalition aprc a national association of railroad equipment suppliers and rail businesses presented him its rail leadership award in march 2002
7557290 moreover his younger son is on the amtrak board and in that capacity is a major advocate for the railroad
7557291 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going
7557292 in this in the hearings he is unlike ted kennedy in that he doesnt seem driven by some obscure malice uh i uh cannot uh remembuh why i hate you judge alioto but there uh must be a good reason and i will um damn well find it when he peers over his glasses at judge alito he is like an old woman whos unfortunately senile and quite sure the teapot on the stove is plotting against her mr biden is also unlike chuck schumer in that he doesnt ask questions with an air of with this one im going to trap you and leave you flailing like a bug in a bug zapper were going to hear your last little crackling buzz any minute now
7557293 probably the strongest experience i have in foreign relations is the fact that i spent four years living overseas when i was a child in southeast asia
7557294 i think hes right that is his strongest foreign policy credential

7557301 without discounting the seriousness of the charges against jesse ray beard the fact that he now appears to want to take advantage of a means of getting the best education possible is heartening
7557302 the fact that the only way he was given this choice was through a tragic series of events points to inherent problems in our nations educational system that must be rectified
7557303 they say that every dark cloud has a silver lining in this case jesse ray beard is laying the groundwork to give himself a second chance through a quality education at a reputable school this is unfortunately not a choice available to his classmates in jena
7557304 while beard may still be punished for what he allegedly did back in louisiana he is now taking advantage of something that could open up collegiate and career opportunities that were little more than a dream at jena high its a crime that parents and students everywhere dont have a similar ability to go to a school that provides ample opportunity

7557327 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7557328 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question
7557329 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7557330 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely
7557331 will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but things changed very quickly saturday night and if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call
7557332 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7557333 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7557334 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7557335 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7557336 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7557337 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7557338 when you come together it is not the lords supper that you eat

7557349 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7557365 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7557366 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7557367 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7557368 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7557369 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7557370 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7557371 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7557372 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7557373 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7557374 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7557375 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7557376 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7557377 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7557378 in the past we essentially measured quality score once per day
7557379 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning
7557380 we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours
7557381 then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7557382 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7557383 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7557384 she has an absolute commitment to the cause and even though i wouldnt like to say that china has listened only time will tell if they have
7557385 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament

7557402 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7557403 im still pledged to hillary because i was elected by my district to be her pledged delegate and im honoring the voters who voted for her
7557404 the recent gse sell off has been surprising since the only catalyst was apparently a press report suggesting that federal officials are likely to recapitalize the gses soon

7557407 they have to go its just a reality its numbers at 100 over 150 over treasurys these entities cannot survive and the only way you can stabilize them and get those spreads down as private entities is if you go out and raise 400 or 500 billion dollars in real equity and were not going to do that we have to recapitalize the banks so weve got to get the gses government sponsored entities off the table now this week would be good if the treasury can have that 15 minute press conference we can get on with it
7557408 thats how you could quickly get into this darker scenario
7557409 if theres a consensus its probably that prices will fall another 10 percent between now and next summer which would be 25 percent down from peak to trough

7557415 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers jun said
7557416 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7557417 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals jun also said that kdb needed to consider its priorities before pursuing global expansion pointing out that stabilization of the domestic financial markets might be the most urgent issue
7557418 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates

7557426 obama claims he is looking out for our families in an economic downturn but ask yourself this if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his own family first

7557438 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called

7557450 mike palecek has the uncanny ability to convey an understanding of real events through the medium of fiction no one who reads this book will ever feel the same way about our government and will burn to learn how close he has come to revealing the truth about the events of 9 11 the answer alas is all too close

7557470 se enfrent a unas elecciones muy dif ciles permiti que tuvi ramos grupo parlamentario en la anterior legislatura y ha sido capaz de dar imagen de una fuerza pol tica til capaz de incidir en las pol ticas de forma constructiva
7557471 se han ubicado en claves que corresponden a las posiciones de otras fuerzas pol ticas
7557472 sobre censos inflados es f cil tener mayor as pero hay que obtenerlas sobre censos reales que se ajusten a la afiliaci n en cada federaci n y algunos no se ajustan a las afiliaciones reales

7557546 i really enjoyed the training and could tell i was benefiting from the program

7557562 i think any of the people that senator mccain is thinking about for vice president will be more than able to hold their own against senator biden
7557563 his selection will probably finish off minnesota governor tim pawlentys chances to be mr mccains vice presidential nominee since its unlikely that mr mccain would send the relatively inexperienced governor pawlenty into a debate with mr biden
7557564 can you imagine what biden would do to pawlenty in the debate
7557565 well what does that have to do with anything voters wont hold it against mitt theyll just be amazed that in such a corrupt industry mitt was able to stay a shining example
7557566 the difference between romney supporters and everyone else is adaptability
7557567 romney might match up better against biden in debate but its clear that the obama biden campaign is moving aggressively to embrace a traditional democratic populist economic message such a message will have appeal this year especially one supposes against a doubly multimansioned g o p ticket of mccain and romney
7557568 i chose jo e schmoh because s he can take biden to the mat
7557569 i chose jo e schmoh because s he is qualified to be vp

7557578 the problem with looking solely at a companys earnings number is that sometimes earnings are hurt by one time events or depreciation which can muddy the waters

7557583 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan

7557585 the neck is fine and 100 per cent but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning so it would be a very calculated risk should we play richard
7557586 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think hes been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player
7557587 i have a lot of faith in richard to make the right decision

7557591 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7557592 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 thougu i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7557593 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play
7557594 tough position to be in it is a challenging situation playing at home do not want to lose series we know where we are going wrong
7557595 i was a little bit intimidated by sir donald especially the first time
7557596 a reflection of our economic climate and we are now going through a correction in the art market
7557597 we wanted to do as diaghilev did and bring together designers choreographers and composers to create new work
7557598 as soon as i met mrozewski and adam i got a feeling that its going to be a good team were reading off the same page
7557599 when i saw what he had done when i saw the dancers these moments are a source of great satisfaction and pleasure
7557600 theres a simplicity with my work this is very spare and succinct
7557601 ive wanted to tell stories before but shied away from it but it crept up on me
7557602 i needed very strong characters and for them to inhabit the roles
7557603 juliet is thoughtful and eerie shes one of those dancers with great imagination she really brings things to life
7557604 the second movement was an intense adagio with episodes representing a yearning for change
7557605 the third movement was an actual journey to an island and the last movement was a celebration what he called a kind of australian bacchanale
7557606 it makes me think of some kind of crazy laboratory and i loved that image what else is there to do inside a lab but experiment
7557607 fonte probably thought i was wildly eccentric and longing for god
7557608 the excitement for me is the wealth of new experience
7557609 usually when you go to the ballet theres always an element youve seen or heard before its very rare that you start off with a blank canvas
7557610 every time i attempted to make this play neat or more realistic which is a difficult word in the theatre anyway the attempt at realism made it dull and in any case was always reductive the play told me not to write life as it is but life as it seems thats what this play wants to be a vision of life as it seems
7557611 whether we chose to believe in astrology or not its an idea or metaphor that i found interesting
7557612 i was interested in the notion of a more authentic person emerging after this process of upheaval and the consolidation of adulthood what is that movement of upheaval that call to responsibility going to be for this generation this time around who will this more authentic person be
7557613 the play uses the grammar of a dream without ever becoming or being a dream
7557614 very early in the piece it moves into metaphor goes through a few of them and then comes out the other end with the characters having gained some insight through the use of these metaphors
7557615 as a literary and theatrical device thats what metaphor does it shows us that something is something else and in doing so becomes revelatory
7557616 we know each others strengths without having allowed ourselves to become complacent
7557617 we challenge each other there is a continual exchange of ideas i have to share i depend on collaboration it must be a great inconvenience to david that i cant finish a scene without emailing it to him i need to talk about these things
7557618 there were hundreds of pages of tommys experiments that i never got to see i never got to read the version where the central character was a robot or the version where the play was actually set on a moon of saturn
7557619 i was told about this phenomenon and i thought it would be best to shield myself from that experience by writing a play
7557620 its obviously a very difficult moment but its also a very positive moment youve got to check some things and make some decisions about what your contribution to the world is going to be
7557621 all of the evidence and witness statements point to lemus death being a tragic accident
7557622 ontela is lucky to get an executive of damians experience and caliber
7557623 after a six month search led by anderson search partners damian was the clear choice for the role we couldnt be happier
7557624 i approached the ontela team after i heard about their early customer successes
7557625 once i saw the product i was hooked its just that easy to get photos off the phone take a picture and they appear like magic on the computer then when i met the engineering team it sealed the deal the technical talent here is absolutely first rate and growing fast helping the team develop is going to be really fun
7557626 to be competitive michigan needs the best educated workforce in the nation and the fact that one in every four high school students is failing to graduate on time is totally unacceptable
7557627 that is why we have fought for programs like early college and small high schools that will help students specifically minority and economically disadvantaged students where the problem is most severe

7557663 one of our problems last year was we needed a bit of edge dig and steel in the middle of the park
7557664 he has got composure when he is on the ball and he doesnt waste very many balls
7557665 the problem ive got is because im using him ive not been training him to a level where i would consider it to be pre season training
7557666 after every game that he has played he has had a little muscle niggle one or the other and thats because he just hasnt trained

7557671 overtreated why too much medicine is making us sicker and poorer this is a drug that may have a really serious side effect called suicide dont we have other drugs available that are safer and just as effective for such things as the management of chronic knee and low back pain

7557681 the party is still proud of its fiscal direction in the clinton years
7557682 barack obama feels obliged to pay lip service to it but there is no sense that this is the highest priority
7557683 americans should be prepared to raise the taxes invest in productivity and create the jobs but they cant support that theyd rather cut taxes invest in defense and build jails
7557684 the experience of most people is one of stagnation and struggle
7557685 there has been an orgy of private consumption but a deficit of public investment

7557687 our roots are here and as a family weve been looking for ways to honor joe who loved sports of all kinds as do all of our family members
7557688 weve always felt that sports played a key role in fostering teamwork and a feeling of togetherness qualities that a family and in our case a family business needs to be successful
7557689 this is a great morning for the altoona area school district and our student athletes
7557690 the sheetz family has always been so supportive of the district when we need help theyve been there for us and theyre here for us today
7557691 about 70 to 75 of our secondary students are involved in piaa sports or intramurals and all of those young people will be able to use the facility
7557692 were grateful to sheetz for what theyve done and continue to do in giving our athletes another avenue to succeed
7557693 weve had some ups and downs with it but the sheetz family really came through and this will be a great opportunity for our student athletes

7557701 consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
7557702 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7557703 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
7557704 beauty has always been a core part of our front of store offering so this is the next evolution
7557705 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
7557706 they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
7557707 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
7557708 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
7557709 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
7557710 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price

7557712 biogen recently got hammered on bad news that wasnt actually so bad biib and partner
7557713 its important to note here that the two companies had predicted that one in 1000 cases could develop pml and the fda let the drug come to market with this understanding with a strong set of patient warnings and physician follow up
7557714 tysabri has succeeded in the marketplace because it is a superior treatment for ms and the patients who use it agree despite its high cost of 30 000 per year
7557715 biib is still targeting 100 000 patients by 2010 and that would translate into 1 billion per quarter in sales
7557716 biogen idec also has the ability to add new products through licensing or direct acquisition and i expect it to do so in the coming quarters this temporary downturn is a godsend for investors biib is now selling well below the valuations of other large cap double digit biotech growers take advantage of this mistake before the street wakes up
7557717 it was a great top five definitely a great rebound from the last couple weeks
7557718 im real proud we fought hard we just couldnt get the car freed up enough there at the end and brought it home fifth so we will take that
7557719 i could have fought a little harder for third and fourth with denny hamlin and kevin harvick but it just wasnt worth it we had to come home with a great finish a top five
7557720 it wasnt the best race car that we put on the race track but it was a really good race car
7557721 we had good track position through qualifying and great pit stops everything really worked out it was kind of a flawless night in a way
7557722 we just didnt have the car to go up there and battle for the lead but still had a great car it was a good night for us
7557723 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7557724 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7557725 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7557726 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7557727 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7557728 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7557729 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7557730 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7557731 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7557732 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7557733 but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7557734 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7557735 be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7557736 strong performance occurring in the face of negative economic trends
7557737 if the ticket was reversed amp obama was a president in training then this longtime goper might have considered casting a vote for the democratic ticket
7557738 although its a long shot i think recent events open the door for a late surge of interest in mike huckabee if this is really going to be base versus base he could help they desperately need the evangelicals in indiana in virginia in colorado hes the only prominent pub who i dont think biden would easily mop the floor with in a debate i would still bet money on romney but i expect some renewed speculation on huck
7557739 wir k nnen in zukunft noch mehr international punkten wenn wir gemeinsame anstrengungen unternehmen um die donau noch effizienter zu bewerben

7557748 when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure the same
7557749 im very happy to be number one its a big satisfaction after a long time being number two but at the same time nothing changes
7557750 this is the last grand slam of the season so its going to be very important for everybody
7557751 if i play a good tournament here im going to have chances to continue to be number one for longer
7557752 hopefully the champions league will take me on to the next stage
7557753 to win a competition like that is a great achievement for any player we are all in the game to win trophies i am no different
7557754 when i have finished i will look back and see how many trophies i have won and judge myself then
7557755 we have a lot of young players in the team and it can only help us
7557756 hopefully we can take that in to the next few years and make us a better team
7557757 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
7557758 i dont just judge my performance on goals i look at assists and how i have helped the team play that is the way my game is
7557759 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a footballer
7557760 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
7557761 we are in an era of individual appreciation earrings tattoos goals the need to be seen
7557762 it is refreshing someone is prepared to sacrifice that for the team effort
7557763 as affirm our special promise to cherish each other mutual love
7557764 and may our love for each other lasts through the rest of time this we pray
7557765 and with him as a witness and foundation of our love through the holy spirit guidance
7557766 you are precious gift i received from god and i pledge my self in obedience to him to be of help to you and to love you
7557767 we also thank you for the love and patience youre shown to us and for teaching us the knowledge of god
7557768 to bear witness the perfect love that grow with us
7557769 i am sorry but i am busy i really need to get this done

7557772 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7557773 in hindsight yeah but i think it served a purpose and i totally agree with offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer and the rest of the offensive staff that we needed to practice that for the simple reason that on film today as we watched it we could address that weve got to get better at that if were going to do it
7557774 he helped me a lot and im not opposed to mike coming back in some capacity
7557775 i mean it s very unfortunate for him and for the giants
7557776 but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him i think that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the was it occurred i mean he just went down
7557777 hey if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team the guy still looks great hell of a player i mean i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now i mean how could you not want him back
7557778 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend

7557788 that was a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track too
7557789 i think we should be very happy with this result i made no mistakes none all weekend and we maximised our performance
7557790 i think the whole team can be very proud of what we have achieved and hopefully in the next races we can finish in the top 10 again
7557791 it was a disastrous race our most disappointing of the year

7557804 dissent serves a function of illuminating for the public the nature
7557805 given the acceleration of declines in newspaper advertising revenue and cash flow at tribune and no evidence from any participants in the industry regarding the prospects for current pressure relenting fitch believes tribunes credit profile is consistent with a ccc rating
7557806 certainly there are some levers that the management tam can pull that can have a positive effect but the one factor thats most important is the top line operating trend and thats the relentless pressure theyre feeling in the classified space
7557807 until we see a reversal in those trends default is a real possibility
7557808 fitchs estimate that 0 recovery is realistic in a distress scenario
7557809 tribune management has met or exceeded fitchs expectations on the elements of its business over which it has more explicit control expense containment asset sales and exclusive dedication of cash flow toward debt repayment
7557810 fitch believes trb tribune management has distinguished itself from other newspaper management teams by taking aggressive actions across various areas of the company to attempt to preserve the longer term health of the company bringing in new leadership from outside the industry communicating directly with staff about the challenges facing the industry reducing headcount re tooling incentive compensation for sales teams redesigning the product exploring asset monetization utilization opportunities and experimenting with new revenue streams
7557811 while the company could receive an amendment or waiver from the banks if it breaches a covenant in this credit environment fitch is uncertain and cautious regarding the terms of such a potential negotiation for such a highly leveraged entity with deteriorating prospects
7557812 in this scenario the receipt of a waiver or amendment without an upturn in business prospects is not likely to have a positive impact on the rating however failure to receive covenant relief could result in a restructuring not necessarily bankruptcy that would likely further pressure ratings

7557979 fact sheet on the family record of senator joe biden
7557980 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7557981 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters

7558017 by implementing policies and procedures required to make safeguarding a customers identity a top priority banks can immediately add value and increase non interest income
7558018 in south africa one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic accident than in the us
7558019 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7558020 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7558021 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7558022 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7558023 the lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response
7558024 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung
7558025 they accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants
7558026 fundamental breakthroughs in these directions are expected on a time scale of 10 to 20 years and are recognized by the international science community as major milestones on the road to a renewable fuel
7558027 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7558028 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7558029 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7558030 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7558031 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7558032 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7558033 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered
7558034 perspectives provides an additional level of safety to browse the internet
7558035 to the security conscious user that is a significant comfort
7558036 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer
7558037 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
7558038 unable to verify the identity of xyz com as a trusted site
7558039 most users dont have a clue about what to do in those cases
7558040 a lot of them just shrug and go ahead with the connection potentially opening themselves up to attack
7558041 with perspectives even if a clients isp has fallen victim to the attack the client will be able to detect that the public key received from the fake site is inconsistent with the results returned from the notaries
7558042 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7558043 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7558044 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7558045 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7558046 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7558047 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7558048 parents usually dont understand their role in the course of their childs career development and cross the line between involvement and intervention
7558049 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7558050 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7558051 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7558052 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught
7558053 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7558054 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7558055 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7558056 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7558057 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7558058 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7558059 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7558060 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
7558061 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7558062 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7558063 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7558064 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7558065 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7558066 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7558067 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7558068 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development
7558069 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
7558070 tva technology fueled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fiber production in the 60s to 80s
7558071 today fertilizers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7558072 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilizers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7558073 tva followed promising new fertilizers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertilizer industry
7558074 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7558075 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7558076 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
7558077 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7558078 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
7558079 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7558080 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7558081 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7558082 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilizers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7558083 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7558084 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity
7558085 ifdc is in a unique position to meet this challenge
7558086 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7558087 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7558088 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7558089 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7558090 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7558091 i think its great being less famous i blame the fact i had shall we say a meeting with russell crowe i had never seen or heard such bad press about me here and its been great in a funny kind of way and you know a good thing too because i now realize the world does not revolve around me
7558092 it was thanks to him that the fire did not spread any further i was amazed ive never seen him move so fast hes the last person youd expect to have such a lightning reaction to anything unless it was illegal but he stopped the situation from getting any worse
7558093 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7558094 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7558095 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7558096 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7558097 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7558121 there arent five banks in the world that look as strong as we are right now so its not like theres a plethora of banks fighting it out to do these deals
7558122 u s banks have been pummeled and the fragile state of real estate and the economy could mean significantly more pain for some of the regional banks
7558123 well continue to look for ways to grow our businesses either organically or through acquisitions not just in the u s but internationally
7558124 as committed today as we ever were at remaining independent
7558125 we continue to believe that there will be more opportunities for consolidation in the u s
7558126 realistically they likely will not begin to develop until later this year and into 2009
7558127 during the tough times the well positioned banks can actually seize on opportunities and those downturns in the industry can be a blessing in disguise

7558174 children are particularly vulnerable there are reports of children being killed injured or gone missing due to the fighting
7558175 we also received reports from partners which indicate an increase in the number of unaccompanied children who have been separated from their family relatives and communities some of them are very young children under seven years old isolated from their supportive environments these children are most vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse as well as exploitation as cheap or free labour
7558176 lack of access is a major issue that we are facing today although humanitarian interventions are ongoing our ability to respond quickly and effectively with high impact has been undermined significantly due to the deteriorating security conditions
7558177 all parties involved in the conflict must prioritize civilians safety and well being especially children and ensure access for humanitarian organizations
7558178 we are very pleased that the court has allowed us to continue pursuing our objective of holding revonet accountable for its actions

7558187 when the council decided to completely upgrade its voice infrastructure with ip telephony our main objective was to ensure reliable performance
7558188 we needed a way to proactively protect our voice video and data services from internal threats the enterasys identity based approach based on user authentication was a perfect fit and leveraged our existing infrastructure investments
7558189 enterasys makes great efforts to look after products once theyre installed and they constantly ensure backward compatibility their products have always been reliable to configure and operate
7558190 we hear mixed reviews about other industry vendors who shout a lot but dont deliver as much
7558191 enterasys has a history with the council of delivering well thought out easy to use network solutions that are flexible and can adapt to any changes in complexity that develop in the course of conducting government business
7558192 the enterasys products work every day and thats just the way it should be

7558205 the paccar px 8 engine provides the trucks with plenty of power to get around particularly up a challenging hill on a half mile stretch of u s interstate 20 on the west side of atlanta
7558206 as a result weve seen sales increase by an average of 30 percent on those routes now handled by the kenworth t370s
7558207 that means an average increase in sales from the previous 170 000 cases annually for each of those routes to 220 000 cases
7558208 the drivers also appreciate the t370s 50 degree wheel cut which makes it easier to maneuver
7558209 thats pretty important in an urban area like atlanta as it comes time to replace our older model trucks we intend to buy more kenworths

7558254 instead of listening to scientists and thousands and thousands of citizens who painstakingly asked blm all during the planning process to live up to the monuments protection mandate the blm has delivered only half a protection loaf
7558255 the blm is playing fast and loose with public process and the law sadly for all a judge will likely have to instruct blm to take the monuments protection mandate seriously
7558256 the blm has shown that the monument our nations first monument to biodiversity is protected on paper alone because the agency cannot divest itself from a resource extraction agenda that has historically degraded these lands and caused ecological and social disruptions
7558257 in many ways this is just the beginning of public involvement in the monument

7558334 he has an illegal gun in his car hes out at five oclock in the morning on a school night and hes going to a strip club when hes underage hes sophisticated enough to be doing those things yet the defense portrayed him as an innocent na ve little boy
7558335 at no time was she ever coming toward him when he shot her because she was shot from the side and rear
7558336 that tells you right there that the defendant is lying if youre coming toward someone your front would get shot
7558337 if you cant think straight youre not going to do that then he calls 911 does this act on the phone about a robbery and unknown gunman and lies to the responding officer and detectives to me that shows a pretty good presence of mind dont you think

7558353 as hard as it is joey made me feel really comfortable doing the show
7558354 i havent danced in 60 years i want to get my muscles back theyre noodles i need the exercise this is the most pleasant way to do it
7558355 im more worried about this than i was during the 100 meter finals
7558356 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity im a big fan of the show i never thought i had the guts to do it but im going to go for it
7558357 as hard as it is joey made me feel really comfortable doing the show
7558358 we get tons of calls but as much as people think the show casts itself it gets more difficult its become a year round job
7558359 i was at the game and shaun was excellent so he certainly comes back into my thoughts
7558360 it looks as if he has had a new lease of life
7558361 i am going to announce the squad on wednesday and he comes into consideration
7558362 i didnt forgot about shaun the problem was he wasnt playing at aston villa
7558363 hes back playing which is the important thing because if you are not playing then it is very difficult to maintain sharpness but he certainly looked sharp on saturday
7558364 i am going to announce the squad on wednesday and he comes into consideration
7558365 the biggest problem is getting my full team out but nevertheless we had some good workouts and that will stand us in good stead for the qualifiers
7558366 we are not inundated with world class players a lot of our key players have been missing and thats been our biggest headache
7558367 we havent qualified for a major tournament for 10 years and people talk about friendlies but we havent won a friendly at hampden in 12 years so it was always going to be difficult
7558368 what a phenomenal race today the wheel to wheel action was as good as it gets there was really world class competition out there today the racing with romain dumas was incredible as we passed back and forth i guess they ran out of fuel like gil i feel bad for gils team they were so close to winning but well take this fourth win and close in on the point lead very exciting for us
7558369 the last two races have been about fuel and our staff led by duncan dayton and rob hill did another great job of calling the right shot at the end our car was fast all weekend but i got caught some bad traffic and that hurt us david did his usual great charge to get the patr n highcroft acura to victory lane this place is like a throwback to older racing with such fast turns its great for a driver
7558370 we were very close to winning the race today our lowes acura team had a great strategy and my car felt good we had some great racing in the p2 class each race well continue to learn about the acura chassis on these fast tracks we had the lola last year and the new chassis is very good we think we can get better with each race
7558371 we had some problems with the battery and that hurt us a little but the lowes acura was fast today we play a fuel game and i felt luis had a good momentum so he stayed in longer than some of the other acura drivers who switched positions after 45 minutes i decided to save a little more fuel than gil and david or we might have had a shot for the win without the suspension problem at road america we should have three straight podium finishes second feels good
7558372 the xm car was not as fast as i would have liked due to the contact james had in the beginning of the race we lost the front wing we were able to race with anyone in our class until we had to pit late for fuel and tires our strategy came close at the end but the race was one lap shorter than we would have liked another bad break
7558373 the xm car was good in my stint today unfortunately i was racing with sharp and we were passing a ferrari in turn eight i dont know if he didnt see me but he ran into my cars left front we lost a dive plane that hurt the aerodynamics a little bit overall we just missed a bit on our fuel strategy and we had to settle for fourth
7558374 it shows how much racing can get you sometimes we will take a lot from this weekend we learned a lot the whole week we had some problems but team had a great strategy and the car was very good in the race i thought gil was outstanding today too
7558375 it was particularly cruel when you consider that we missed the checkered flag by just about a second that made us take another lap and we ran out of fuel it was always going to be tight for us on fuel but the team did a very good job working the numbers i tried to keep the proper fuel reading that they wanted and we ran great laps and saved fuel we thought the race would end one lap sooner unfortunately that didnt happen today our guys did great in calling all the right moves including getting us back on the lead lap in the early portion of the race we have been struggling all weekend with the car but in the race it felt good and our lap times were very good i was feeling very comfortable in the lead and i had a good rhythm in the cockpit it felt good to run up front again i think we can do more of that in the future it is a tough way to lose

7558380 for years ramirez abadia and his organization made billions of dollars by exporting misery to the united states through drug trafficking and murder
7558381 his illegal operation included drug manufacturers couriers money launderers and accountants and he and his cohorts resorted to bribery kidnapping torture and even murder to further their goal of making as much money as possible now he will be held to account in a u s court of law
7558382 the norte valle cartel is a sophisticated and dangerous cocaine trafficking organization that for almost two decades has smuggled more than 10 billion worth of cocaine from colombia to the united states
7558383 as one of its leaders ramirez abadia oversaw the complex drug trafficking operation and use of violence to preserve the cartels power and control
7558384 today one of the most violent and prolific narcotics traffickers in the hemisphere has been extradited to the united states to be held accountable for his crimes ramirez abadia a long time drug kingpin now faces justice in a u s court of law

7558386 food fuel and water crisis in an increasingly populated world
7558387 action is crucial because much is at stake and time is running out five thousand boys and girls under age 5 die every day around the world from diseases spread by dirty water and inadequate sanitation this morning more than a billion people woke up without clean water to drink
7558388 i believe we are at a tipping point the specter is of a food fuel and water crisis in an increasingly populated world facing climate change it means the private and public sectors have a shared interest in working together to solve the worlds water and sanitation challenges
7558389 in an increasingly urbanized world water conservation involves both demand and supply side management between 40 percent and 70 percent of water distributed by city networks in emerging markets is lost to leakages and theft reduce the losses by 20 percent in jakarta and some 800 000 people can have reliable access to drinking water
7558390 now that companies are seeing water as a business risk they are making comprehensive water strategies an integral part of risk management they are going to governments and asking how can we be part of the solution this is what gives me confidence

7558405 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7558406 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7558407 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7558408 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7558409 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7558410 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

7558432 gt conference of ministers of gender and womens affairs which began today while more than 25 government ministers are expected to take part in the ministerial portion to take place on 28 29 august

7558434 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7558435 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7558436 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7558437 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7558438 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7558439 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7558440 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7558441 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7558442 linking ourselves to vivitar will strengthen our presence on the retail shelf while also enabling retailers to buy more product from a single source

7558457 we needed a little redemption because we wanted to get not only physically ready but get in the right mindset for the regular season
7558458 its important to build on everything and i think we did that tonight
7558459 tonight it was about us executing and showing people how good we can be

7558472 and bikes are going to be part of it its not everything
7558473 were a family that likes to fish and play in the outdoors and i was worried about the mercury that was showing up in idahos waters
7558474 it would have gone forward without the idaho conservation league
7558475 many of us got into this work thinking that one person can make a difference
7558476 heres where one person who makes a difference makes a difference around the world
7558477 from that moment on we got the sense that epa was really working aggressively on this
7558478 these events demonstrate not only that the incentives weve built into the program are producing early emissions reductions but also that the regulations contain strong enforcement provisions
7558479 this is exactly how the program was intended to work
7558480 clear skies ahead boise leaders predict healthy valley outlook in 2008
7558481 we have had an almost unparalleled two decade run of just blistering economic growth and weve grown very accustomed to it
7558482 now were going through an episode of cyclical correction that happens from time to time
7558483 how could we have been so stupid in all honesty we should have all realized what was happening sooner
7558484 but none of us know how to predict the turning points
7558485 we are not immune to whats going on on the national front
7558486 knock both pillars out at the same time and its a pretty difficult situation
7558487 we slowed down enough that it snapped back and you have the same multiplier effect on the downside as you do on the upside
7558488 that 650 million just disappeared its gone to oil producing companies and big oil companies
7558489 we have seen employment go from zero to thousands and were afraid that well see it go from thousands to zero
7558490 there is no doubt that the semiconductor business is going through tough times but until we have better information i am not going to predict the demise of micron
7558491 a lot of the businesses said we havent given up on idaho but were not making that decision now
7558492 they see people fishing in the river and they freak out this is a cool city
7558493 let me tell you what you guys inherited when you came to power
7558494 youre not going to leave me with an albertsons a washington group a jabil a zilog a santa clara plastics an ore ida youre going to hand me a simplot maybe a micron and st lukes and saint als whats happened
7558495 thats something that normally occurs in every economy and sometimes a little downturn may be good the growth weve experienced in the last several years has caused problems too it may be good to slow a little bit so we can catch our breath
7558496 i cant justify doing that at the expense of our citizens when they have little or no capacity to provide more support for government
7558497 you tend to your knitting you invest in education you have as fair a tax structure as possible and you get creative with partnerships
7558498 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7558499 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are
7558500 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway

7558505 its whether or not the public has a right to be involved
7558506 the no 1 priority for the bush administration aside from logging has been to reduce public accountability
7558507 the united states seeks to shield from judicial review certain rules that bar the public from participation in federal management decisions affecting national forests
7558508 bensmans preclusion from participation in the appeals process may yield diminished recreational enjoyment of the national forests
7558509 because environmental injuries and hardships become imminent only to the extent an environment disturbing project is proposed factual challenges to rules based on theories of environmental damage are seldom justifiable
7558510 we wanted to figure out a creative way to build something that was sustainable
7558511 this method has been used for 10 000 years people all around the world have been building their houses like this
7558512 its labor intensive but thats not always a bad thing

7558517 si somos capaces de influir desde extremadura para que no se desvirt e esta figura de los ingenieros t cnicos habremos cumplido el objetivo que hemos venido a transmitirle al presidente
7558518 suponemos que la inmediatez del pr ximo curso va a acelerar el desarrollo legislativo de los ciclos de las ingenier as porque la idea es que en el curso 2008 2009 empiecen a funcionar estas ense anzas para los ingenieros
7558519 se podr a retrasar un a o m s pero crear a un grave problema a todos aquellos estudiantes que quisieran empezar a estudiar o a aquellas familias que conjuntamente quisieran decidir con sus hijos qu camino emprender
7558520 no hay ingenieros t cnicos industriales en extremadura para cubrir la demanda que hay en la regi n
7558521 nadie se va a embarcar en una carrera de como m nimo cuatro a os sin saber como va a quedar la estructura de las nuevas titulaciones

7558525 naomi wants to get more clients who are fun and who get her
7558526 there were continuous decisions given against us and i reacted badly
7558527 i know this season we are to respect the referee rightly so and i didnt react in a great way
7558528 but i was disappointed with phil dowd who is a very capable referee i was disappointed with his performance in the first half
7558529 i reacted in a way that i shouldnt have i will be punished for that no doubt and i will take that
7558530 it is very difficult to say if i regret my reaction i should have maybe sat down and thought about it a bit longer
7558531 but i defy any manager when it gets like that just to sit back
7558532 we did show some good movements and it was a pity to lose because we had a good start
7558533 however we lose and win together so we cant point the finger against someone in particular because it was the whole teams fault
7558534 we are going to analyse the game with coach stefano colantuono and then we will try to learn from our errors
7558535 this team has got quality and we want to give our best to the fans and the president it is understandable that they are upset now but things will improve
7558536 nous avons parl de la possibilit daugmenter leffort pour la culture en

7558539 je lui ai dit quil fallait aller plus loin que a et faire arte entre
7558540 ce serait une b n diction pour tout le monde
7558541 la vraie dimension de ce projet va arriver le jour o lorchestre pourra se produire dans tous les pays qui y sont repr sent s
7558542 we dont want other people to have to learn the hard way
7558543 i worked for 11 years and the most i made per hour was 11
7558544 she sends me e mails and says how much she admires me and how much she appreciates all the hard work i do
7558545 i feel like i can do any type of business now with the experience i got here
7558546 unlike the conventional act of making a photograph which holds still time in an instantaneous moment my photographs explore sublime landscapes using long exposures ranging from 5 minutes to 18 hours these extreme long exposures reveal the passage of time and its effect on the landscape
7558547 when i did the french version i sent an email to 50 friends three months later it was the most popular french language site in canada
7558548 we arent making a big deal out of it the media are waiting for us even if we have a quarter of the success we had in french we will be happy
7558549 we have scottish british texan indian the accents will make it interesting for people from all over the world

7558559 i paid 12 to see radiohead perform in the ucr gymnasium
7558560 if i were barack obama right now i would be hoping against hope that the celebrities would just keep quiet about me
7558561 its true that after mccains celebrity ad every single hollywood person who comes out on the obama bandwagon is more evidence for mccains argument that he is a celebrity
7558562 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
7558563 the mccain people decided to take the things that are obamas assets hes charismatic hes likeable the press adore him all that stuff and turn that into a liability
7558564 obamas people should respond by saying this is a really good thing
7558565 being popular should be a good thing if youre running for president
7558566 if john mccain could draw 250 000 people in berlin he would do it if he could fill up a football stadium at his convention he would do it
7558567 i think obama could very easily say whats wrong with being popular
7558568 the republicans are appealing to a sense that hollywood celebrity popularity are on the left liberal out of touch
7558569 whether its al gore or john kerry the democrats have a history of not being able to play on the same terrain as the republicans
7558570 somehow they think that if you take the high road its going to appeal to people that people dont like negative ads
7558571 to scare the heck out of you about the democratic nominee
7558572 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7558573 but ultimately this election is not about me its about you and whether we are going to allow ourselves to watch this country get run into the ground
7558574 whether we are going to do the same old things over and over and over again and somehow expect a different result or whether we are finally going to decide not this time this time were going to try something different
7558575 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7558576 it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the american people are going to face in november
7558577 i have respect for john mccains service i dont have respect for john mccains policies because they represent four more years of the same
7558578 the same attitude and the same out of touch policies
7558579 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair
7558580 so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7558581 expressed deep sorrow and condemned in the strongest possible terms
7558582 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be re regulated based on bilateral agreements
7558583 the limits of authorities and responsibilities of the international forces must be regulated under bilateral agreements based on international and afghan laws
7558584 air strikes on civilian targets unilateral searches of homes and illegal detentions of afghan civilians must be stopped
7558585 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7558586 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7558587 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7558588 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7558589 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
7558590 the release of this group fills us with joy but we will not be satisfied until all prisoners are released the 11 000 who are still waiting
7558591 there will be no peace without the release of all our prisoners
7558592 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence
7558593 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released
7558594 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years
7558595 it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks

7558606 un disco complicado que se diferencia de otros trabajos anteriores de metallica en que se siente como algo vivo
7558607 grabamos cada tema como si lo estuvi semos tocando en directo era pr cticamente un espect culo
7558608 es una canci n m s cl sica quiz tiene un sabor m s parecido a la vieja escuela de metallica y en ella james hace un gran trabajo con la guitarra
7558609 hay gente que nos dice que es una canci n demasiado larga para un single 7 58 minutos para ser honestos no nos importa este lbum no est basado en singles es un material m s cl sico igualmente parece que la gente la est aceptando bien

7558626 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7558627 you know to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires is what he did but i tried to get him back i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7558628 its too bad we tore up the car a little bit after the race but i guess he wasnt happy about it and i can understand i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take

7558639 das biosiegel liefert keinen ausreichenden hinweis f r einen klimafreundlichen konsum von lebensmitteln
7558640 nach unseren berechnungen w rde es reichen wenn wir so wenig fleisch wie die italiener essen
7558641 dann ist deutschland auch zu 100 prozent mit bio ern hrbar

7558644 they will be playing for a home semi final if they win this week
7558645 gets most of its effectiveness from using tight feedback loops and enforcing information accuracy
7558646 coming in for dids and shawry maybe but it doesnt really matter weve got three wins on the board and hopefully well win next week and then play finals
7558647 we had the runs on the board against sydney i think wed won our last five so we just needed to get on top early and put the pressure on we did that and came away with a great win
7558648 in the first game i only played about 58 per cent of the match and i was spent extremely tired
7558649 but as you play more games you adapt better and im starting to find the pace a bit more now but it was definitely a big step up from the vfl
7558650 mick malthouse told me that people say its fast but its actually faster than fast so i was prepared
7558651 its very high intensity the tackling and everything is so ferocious
7558652 some of the best playing ive ever done has been in the basement with ed and ray
7558653 thigpens tasteful swinging sensitive and well recorded drums continue to amaze his style remains thoroughly eloguent
7558654 a technical thing first but a matter of relationship and communication
7558655 joe and i were on the same page with a lot of stuff
7558656 feel good pulse this feel good pulse or rhythmic beat is the unifying force that binds the ensemble the soloist and the audience together
7558657 at this age you feel yourself in the position of a mentor whether you like it or not the youngsters who are now the new names want to sit down and listen to what you have to say you know one thing sure the jazz tradition will never die this music is too good
7558658 ed thigpen was a reflective yet complete percussionist he wasnt really a drummer he was a percussionist he had that feeling all the time that it wasnt just drums that he was sitting at he sees his drums as a complete not instrument but orchestra whatever he wants it to be ed thigpen has a touch on the drums that you seldom hear jo jones had that same thing
7558659 i was listening very carefully to ed thigpen with the peterson trio there were two albums in particular the trio plays and night train both on verve those two albums just killed me
7558660 ask cobham to name the drummers who inspired him while he was developing his craft and he reels off an impressive list max roach roy haynes elvin jones tony williams stan levey kenny clarke louie bellson gus johnson don lamond grady tate connie kay and ed thigpen
7558661 so that ruins what i feel about jazz those heavy drum solos and that shit id much prefer to hear somebody like ed thigpen drummer with new york session group stuff and featured on innumerable hits take a solo i mean thats what it is id much rather hear that than the jazz rock thing because its blowing an aspect of jazz that i really like the level where you can snap your fingers to it and you can groove to it you can do anything to it
7558662 ive had many wonderful teachers and mentors including my first drum teacher billy flanagan to gary chaffee alan dawson ed thigpen jim chapin fred gruber pete magadini and efrain toro
7558663 he comes back and forth to the united states all the time and i was lucky to catch him when he was in new york ed thigpen has been out there for a very long time when i asked him to play drums on my date i pulled on his tasteful expression of rhythm
7558664 hamilton and erskine both credit ed thigpen as an important influence through his pioneering work as a member of the oscar peterson trio from 1959 to 1965
7558665 the most startlingly outstanding acquisition though was the thigpen side out of the storm
7558666 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs

7558678 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7558679 while we still need court approval of our plan we believe the end of this complex bankruptcy is finally in sight
7558680 the end result is really regrettable after a long time we were finally able to once again fight for a meaningful position on the upside we collected points and the next rounds at motegi and autopolis should suit the car well i want to fight at the front again and aim at becoming series champion
7558681 with the trouble we faced at the start i thought we had no chance i can tell you those 62 laps i drove were hard i pushed with all my might and the team responded with excellent work in the pits in addition of course seb philippe also fought very hard to do so well in front of so many people is superb this win is absolutely fantastic
7558682 our strategy was to go for the win with five pit stops however the cowl lock coming off was something we couldnt have imagined because of that trouble we couldnt achieve our aim that was our best chance of taking a win so the result is deeply disappointing however michael krumm put on a gallant fight right to the very end and showed the speed that has returned to the 23 car therefore i dont think that the race was bad overall we will still have the three races and aim the championship of this year
7558683 leveraging nvidia cuda technology to accelerate our application on the gpu has dramatically improved the filtering speed of the tmpgenc 4 0 xpress software
7558684 cuda technology has helped us deliver this result in a relatively short development time because it is intuitive to c programmers

7558701 these comments please me because they come from a former coach and colleague which thus make them even more important
7558702 everyone involved in this project wants to see it as a great environmental success story and hopefully it will be in the longer term but there are some short term negatives that are being glossed over
7558703 but id be cautious because these are potentially very toxic concentrations were seeing
7558704 i certainly dont believe anyone is trying to cover up things but i think people really underestimated the complexity of this river system
7558705 epa can no longer ignore the overwhelming evidence of uncontrolled release of hazardous substances
7558706 pplm demands that epa undertake immediate actions to limit the risk of erosion of significant amounts of impacted sediments from the milltown site
7558707 my overall impression of the removal to date is that the well intentioned desire to do something outstripped some very real cautions offered by knowledgeable scientists
7558708 whether there will be long term negative consequences from the removal and its aftermath remain to be seen
7558709 a relatively simple model was applied to a very complex problem but the first time i walked that upper reservoir area it was obvious to me that the sediment there was highly mobile and a lot of it would be scoured once the dam was breached

7558752 considering roberto mancinis dismissal at inter despite winning three scudetti in a row carlo ancelotti must be pleased that he is employed by the citys other footballing giant ac milan after a fine first half of the season winning the european supercup and the club world cup the rossoneri collapsed into mediocrity and put up a half hearted challenge for the league title changing their objective to the fourth champions league qualifying spot before missing out on that at the last hurdle milan had a desperately disappointing ending to the 2007 2008 serie a season ending in a disastrous fifth position two points behind fiorentina in 4th not to mention inter roma and juventus thus missing out on the very lucrative uefa champions league qualifying spots despite a determined 4 1 win in the final game of the season against udinese the rossoneri would find their only path into europe was through the uefa cup milan were conditioned by a fiercely fatigued squad that had taken part in and won the club world cup in japan defeating boca juniors in the final this forced the rossoneri to miss three crucial serie a games which had to be caught up on their return unfortunately for the milan players the jet lag seemed to stay with them throughout the rest of the season playing a match virtually every three days between league coppa italia and champions league commitments the rossoneri were eventually knocked out of europes top club competition by a youthful arsenal team players like gattuso and pirlo were visibly exhausted and were not able to provide their usual match winning contributions as often as in the previous years the lack of champions league football will be a particularly hard pill to swallow for the rossoneri when considering their illustrious history and their dominance of the competition in recent times maldini and company won europes elite competition in 2003 and 2007 losing in the final in 2005 in terms of the scoring charts the usual suspects did what they do best with kaka ending the season as milans top scorer in serie a with 15 goals young brazilian prodigy alexandre pato came into the picture for the milanisti in january making an automatic impact with a goal on his debut against napoli the 18 year old ended the campaign with an impressive 9 goals to his name filippo inzaghi had a difficult middle of the season with injury keeping him from giving his usual contribution in attack this all changed however with the last third of the season producing vintage inzaghi displays allowing the player to score 11 goals before end of 2007 2008 in terms of achievement the previous campaign cannot be written off as a total failure however as silverware was still abundant in the form of the european supercup and the much sought after club world cup these victories may have been overshadowed by the lack of achievement domestically but they do still add an element of prestige to 2007 2008 summer activity milan coach carlo ancelotti will still be at the helm of the rossoneri at the beginning of this campaign the former milan player his been in charge of the team since 2001 making him the longest serving coach currently in serie a milan have not been quiet in the transfer market during the summer making waves with a number of high profile signings and impressive captures the rossoneri have pleased the fans securing the signatures of various top class players in all positions the team have addressed problems in squad depth and injury depletion by scouting the market for high quality cover in all departments gianluca zambrotta has been brought in from barcelona to strengthen the back line allowing ancelotti the added tactical edge of playing the italian international on either the left or right flanks zambrottas attacking qualities and technical skills will be a bonus for the teams offensive game mathieu flamini who many consider the most ingenious transfer move of the summer has been signed on a four year deal strengthening a midfield that is already rated amongst the best in world football previously with arsene wengers arsenal the frenchman will need to bring balance and bite to a midfield that can boast some of the most creative players around as far as attacking players go the rossoneri have added the name of marco borriello to their team sheet for the season ahead a striker with a real sense for goal and a strong physique borriello scored 19 goals for genoa in serie a last season to finish third in the goal scoring charts behind the juventus pair of alessandro del piero and david trezeguet milans most exciting transfer swoop was the signing of brazilian superstar ronaldinho from spanish club barcelona the player was on the wanted list of numerous other clubs but the ever vigilant adriano galliani made sure that the 28 year old made the switch to milan the brazilians move may be an attempt to jumpstart a career in need of fresh motivation this may serve the rossoneri well as a rejuvenated ronaldinho was seen at the olympics captaining brazil and enjoying his football once more another throwback signing was that of andriy shevchenko who re joins milan from chelsea the ukrainian has had a miserable two years with the blues since signing from the rossoneri in 2006 for a whopping 45m the forward has been a shadow of the player who wowed audiences at san siro between 1999 and 2006 scoring 127 goals in just 208 games it remains to be seen whether shevchenko can roll back the years given his age but he certainly is now back in an environment that will give him every chance of flourishing the return of goalkeeper christian abbiati may help to solidify a role that has been problematic for the rossoneri over the last two seasons his displays in pre season have been very impressive indeed standard de li ge have signed defender dig o on loan from the rossoneri with yoann gourcuff also sent on loan to bordeaux gilardinos high profile move to fiorentina opened up a gap in attack for borriello and ronaldinho to fill cafu and serginho retired at the end of last year but luca antonini and zambrotta have been recruited to fill the shoes of these great wing backs lastly milan signed two uruguayan youngsters tabar viudez and mathias cardaccio to improve the depth of the squad analysis amp prognosis milan began pre season training on 16 july playing their first friendly a few days later drawing 0 0 with cremonese the rossoneri went on to win the tim cup triangular tournament including juventus and inter only to disappoint in the russian railways tournament in moscow coming last and adding insult to injury losing 5 0 in a nightmarish game against chelsea on 9 august milans bad form against english opposition continued with a friendly against manchester city ending in a 1 0 loss the diavoli began to show the kind of form that the fans have been expecting when they won the 2008 edition of the trofeo berlusconi last sunday beating the old lady 4 1 at the san siro the birra moretti trophy produced a win for the rossoneri against napoli and a penalty shoot out loss against juventus although many of the players used in the round robin tournament were from the youth team milan have had somewhat of an injury crisis during this pre season period and may be forced back into the transfer market due to certain gaps left in the squad one of the positions that seems most unstable at the moment is that of the centre back role missing the qualities of injury prone alessandro nesta and suffering to a certain degree from the lack of a true centre back with full backs often having to deputise in the middle of defence a central defender may still arrive before the transfer window closes but it is a surprise that the purchase of a top class centre back was not a priority the season ahead will have milan fighting for titles on three fronts in terms of the league italian cup and uefa cup since the failed champions league qualification the team has made it clear that this years objective is the scudetto with uefa cup success becoming a secondary objective as usual the milan club will give little importance to the italian cup using it as a stage to blood younger players and give squad outsiders a game after the fantastic transfer campaign and the club establishing the serie a title as the seasons main objective anything short of a winning finish or at least second place and an automatic champions league spot would be disappointing for milan and its fans the players will surely have the champions league places in mind and will want to return to challenge europes finest in the competition next season a first place finish is certainly not beyond the rossoneri and with the advantage of being the only favourite for the scudetto that is not in the champions league milan could be crowned champions of italy at the end of 2008 2009

7558942 the ski team was an important and formative part of my harvard education although skiing is an individual sport i liked the way the team always had a strong sense of community and shared goals it was also nice to have something that got me out of the library and away from many of the stresses that come with college my teammates were among my closest friends in college and remain so to this day
7558943 that was quite a while ago as an individual sport that requires a lot of off season training skiing relies on athletes to be self motivated and responsible this makes being a captain go pretty smoothly in most cases even so there are plenty of opportunities for leadership and to develop new projects and goals as a coach i definitely depend on my captains for these kinds of things
7558944 ive been competing at the masters level for a number of years and i find that it helps keep me motivated to train throughout the year skiers in new england enjoy a very competitive and robust masters racing circuit some of the fiercest racing is right here in the boston area at the weston ski track we get up to 70 masters skiers out for a regular tuesday evening time trial the new england nordic ski association nensa has built a strong regional circuit of races that range from sprints to 50km marathons i enjoy the challenge of racing and i hope to keep doing some racing to the extent my coaching responsibilities allow
7558945 skiing changes constantly training waxing technique all of these are in constant flux its really important to stay current and one of the best ways is through continuing coaching education fortunately theres good support for coaches through nensa the us ski team has also been doing a good job of reaching out to coaches skiing is a lifetime sport not only can you ski long after your playing days at some other sports are over but you can learn something new every time you go out i think thats very exciting
7558946 sure i was one of three coaches that split the job shortly after i graduated from harvard in 1994 the team looked a bit different then we were largely working with new skiers and trying to develop a team from within today we have skiers who come in with a high school racing resume that often includes racing at junior nationals or top performances at their state or regional championships i enjoy working with skiers at each of these levels but to be competitive in our league the eisa we need to recruit and develop skiers from the latter group
7558947 it was a tough decision but at the time i wanted to explore other avenues im glad i did it i found law school to be tremendously engaging intellectually and i continue to build on what i learned there and in law practice in my academic research im a doctoral student in geography
7558948 i really enjoyed working with peter peter was great with our student athletes he also did a great job of building up this program over the past six years peter helped raise the visibility of the program and working with our alumni helped to build a stable network of support for the program as a head coach with a national reputation peter was able to attract some outstanding new skiers over the past few years peter is a great friend to skiing in20general and i know hell continue to be a great friend to our team
7558949 im very excited to be back at harvard the athletic department here has been very welcoming harvard is a very vibrant and exciting place to be and theres a lot of interesting things going on here all the time i have always enjoyed working with college age students and athletes its one of the primary reasons im in education its also nice to give something back to a program that was so important to my own development as an athlete and an individual

7559064 yet food petrol and rents are skyrocketing pensioners are struggling to keep their heads above water
7559065 age pensioners were struggling in may when the federal government handed down its budget and things have deteriorated since then especially in terms of high fuel prices and the flow on effect for the rest of the economy
7559066 a range of other costs have gone up along the way weve already had the treasurer and the prime minister saying they couldnt live on 273 a week
7559067 the question we keep asking is if you cant then why should you expect our oldest and most vulnerable citizens to do so
7559068 there are legitimate questions to ask about what the state government is contributing to their pensioners such as the need for better and more accessible public transport services
7559069 its not just the commonwealth states have responsibilities as well
7559070 there is clearly an argument developing that people living on their own are facing higher cost of living pressures and we welcome the federal initiative
7559071 about this time next year we will make a decision on which city gets put forward

7559085 the changes announced on wednesday were certainly not made in response to any perceived threat to government and the stability of the nation
7559086 in view of comments and speculations in the media concerning the recent changes in the command structure of the armed forces the presidency wishes to affirm that the changes were made in the normal course of affairs and were not a reaction to any particular occurrence
7559087 the changes announced on wednesday were certainly not made in response to any perceived threat to government and the stability of the nation attempts to tie the changes to statements by some politicians should therefore be disregarded as mere mischief
7559088 the fact is that a change of guards in the armed forces had been on the cards for sometime since both the former chief of defence staff general andrew azazi and the former chief of naval staff admiral ganiyu adekeye became due for retirement several months ago
7559089 the changes were not made earlier because of the presidents insistence that things be done properly at all times he demanded proper background checks and briefs on all those recommended as replacements for the outgoing service chiefs and also undertook necessary consultations
7559090 the former service chiefs are respected professionals who did their jobs to the best of their abilities and president yaradua met with them on wednesday afternoon to thank them for their services to the nation that was at least about two hours before their meeting with the defence minister alhaji yayale ahmed
7559091 in keeping with his abiding belief in due process president yaradua has directed that the army council as well as the navy and air force boards should meet early next week to ratify the promotions of the chief of defence staff and service chiefs to their new ranks he will decorate them with the insignias of their new ranks thereafter
7559092 we mobilized our people for the election and that is why we have free and fair election as early as 8am 9am our people were ready waiting for the materials that arrived on time though some units were relatively low but it was orderly there was no rigging no rancour and opposition parties participated in the elections
7559093 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us

7559095 but in their new role as bloggers the papers editors seem to have all the intelligence and reason of the average daily kos diarist sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons and dragons
7559096 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
7559097 if my comments caused any harm or hurt to the hard working americans who play dungeons amp dragons i apologize this campaign is committed to increasing the strength constitution dexterity intelligence wisdom and charisma scores of every american

7559109 este lbum tiene ingredientes del sonido antiguo de metallica tiene su sabor pero a n as cuenta con elementos diferentes tiene mucha personalidad y es muy din mico para crearlo james vocalista y guitarra y lars tuvieron que dejar de huir de su pasado y aceptarlo
7559110 un disco complicado que se diferencia de otros trabajos anteriores de metallica en que se siente como algo vivo

7559117 we will have a dozen or so people including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will be able to address scientific questions at the frontier of modern astronomy
7559118 we now have these great telescopes that have taken beautiful pictures of spiral galaxies
7559119 our research group will be unique because we will be able to look at different types of supermassive black holes those generating lots of light and those that are quiet
7559120 dark matter could possibly be the link between black holes and galaxy structure
7559121 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7559122 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7559123 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7559124 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7559125 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7559126 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways

7559156 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7559157 its extremely important to just keep making forward progress rather than prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7559158 ultimately gaza has to be resolved and it has to be resolved on the basis of abu mazens abbass programme for it
7559159 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7559160 i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7559161 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
7559162 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
7559163 not as far as im aware regarding what ea needs to do i cant comment on that ea takes piracy very seriously and people deserve to get paid for content they create but as far as im aware we have no plans that i know of to partner with atari and codemasters and chase down consumers
7559164 a further complaint to higher authorities in the state will be made by the family
7559165 the eye witnesses know that there was more than one soldier involved in the rape and murder but the case is now being handled by army authorities without any trial
7559166 this is not justice five hundred dollars and some rice is no compensation for what nhkum hkawn din went through
7559167 her father was distressed and said my daughter was exchanged with this money when army authorities gave the compensation to them the family wants justice not money
7559168 there is still no proper investigation and senior soldiers involved in the case are literally getting away with the murder
7559169 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster

7559200 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was

7559276 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
7559277 its satans ultimate desire to cause christians to believe that living under grace has abolished the necessity of obeying gods law or that it is of no consequence what you believe as long as you believe in jesus the bible disagrees with both of these notions
7559278 obedience to gods law will never save however the law plays an integral role in pointing out what sin is thus creating a need for christ the saviour the fruit of accepting this invitation is living in obedience to gods laws

7559329 the american energy act provides for more domestic oil drilling in an environmentally responsible manner in the outer continental shelf and alaska and it allows greater development of our oil shale resources it cuts red tape that prevents new refineries from being constructed

7559331 most importantly the american energy act does all of this without raising taxes or increasing federal mandates in a way that would increase costs to consumers
7559332 we are at a unique moment in the recent history of energy policy in america for the first time ever there is a bipartisan majority in congress that would vote for comprehensive energy legislation that includes more domestic drilling congress should return to washington d c immediately and give the republicans and democrats who support energy legislation that gives the american people more access to american oil a vote nothing less than our economy our security and our energy independence are at stake

7559365 in fact weve found that more than two thirds of all giant ragweed seedlings emerge from earthworm burrows
7559366 our study shows that nightcrawlers are some of natures most effective weed farmers
7559367 they actively forage for weed seeds pull them into their burrows and then plant them under up to several inches of soil

7559369 but they have three special favorites giant ragweed bur cucumber sicyos angulatus and sunflower helianthus annuus

7559474 what does it matter if i can buy a hydrogen car if i cant get fuel for it
7559475 die hochschulpr sidenten haben die notwendigen kompromisse gemeinsam mit dem ministerium erarbeitet das gilt auch f r die frage wo die nth k nftig ihren sitz haben wird
7559476 das projekt nth ist auf initiative der beteiligten hochschulen entwickelt und nicht von oben verordnet worden es bleibt dabei dass die politik die rechtlichen und finanziellen rahmenbedingungen schaffen kann aber die hochschulen werden die nth selbst mit leben f llen m ssen
7559477 es war mir gerade in diesem projekt besonders wichtig die beteiligten universit ten fr hzeitig und kontinuierlich einzubinden denn eine konstruktive zusammenarbeit von universit ten die auch eine wissenschaftliche schwerpunktbildung bewirken soll ist nur m glich wenn die professorinnen und professoren die angestrebten vorteile wollen und erkennen
7559478 vielmehr erwarte ich dass bereits bestehende kooperationen noch weiter ausgebaut werden und neue hinzukommen
7559479 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
7559480 zentralen baustein f r eine intensivere individueller f rderung von sch lerinnen und sch lern der grund und hauptschulen
7559481 die f rderlehrerinnen und f rderlehrer unterst tzen die kinder dabei in deutsch und mathematik ihre f higkeiten zu erweitern
7559482 die individuelle f rderung ist heute die zentrale element f r eine gelingende schulische bildung
7559483 auf die gestiegenen anforderungen von wirtschaft und gesellschaft im 21 jahrhundert bereitet die neue oberstufe des bayerischen gymnasiums die sch lerinnen und sch ler vor
7559484 mit den geoinformationssystemen ist die digitale welt im bestm glichen sinne im unterricht angekommen
7559485 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
7559486 i am not looking back i am only looking forward
7559487 so go ahead and indulge just plan on some extra time on the treadmill and you will be back to your pre holiday weight
7559488 the only other time i can remember somebody having turned down oscar because of financial reasons at least since 2000 when i was involved with oscar
7559489 was shane mosley who then went on to go and fight winky wright we all know what happened he could have made substantially more money but he went on to fight winky and he lost
7559490 a proposed robinson carmen basilio iii never happened because of rays money demands and i believe thats also the reason that robinson vs archie moore never happened even though it would have been a big payday for moore
7559491 gene fullmer and basilio hated his guts and fullmer had to fight for virtually nothing when he won the title in 57 from robinson those guys had a lot of pride even if they could have made more fighting robinson they just didnt want to be insulted the way he could insult people it wasnt like they werent proven fighters robinson was always like that and i guess he outpriced himself and then he wound up fighting for almost nothing and losing the title to paul pender
7559492 these guys turning down oscar fights are not exactly paupers
7559493 its not like hattons fighting for 200 000 or 300 000 the money is pretty incredible these days
7559494 good id like to see a cart driver win this race somebody different would be nice
7559495 this is how to pass on a roadcourse and this is how not to pass on a roadcourse
7559496 goofus forces his way past people on the road pushing them into the dirt gallant always checks his mirrors and makes sure he has plenty of room before he merges back in
7559497 specifically and unequivocally prohibits all commercial activity in any state park without the written permission of the department of conservation and natural resources
7559498 this court must conclude that the camp is precluded from engaging in commercial activity inside the state park without the department of conservation and natural resources written permission as a matter of regulatory interpretation
7559499 apparently pennsylvanians cannot rely on their constitution when the government suppresses their freedom simply to increase the profits of favored private businesses
7559500 excluding the camp from rafting is about the financial interests of four commercial outfitters
7559501 resolved to find a solution that allows our campers to get back on the river
7559502 this unfortunate ruling denies our campers the powerful sense of accomplishment and lifelong memories that have been an integral part of our program for more than 30 years
7559503 im not looking for crimes im not trying to do a stakeout order chinese food and sit outside a guys house for three days
7559504 the private investigation industry obviously has grown and now we have people involved in private investigative work that do utilize computers and things of that nature
7559505 if a mother brought her sons computer to me and asked me why the son got a virus or what web sites the son was visiting if i check that out id be conducting an investigation for a third party
7559506 i own it and from head to toe i do everything on the vehicle
7559507 they operate under rules set by the company and they have to report to that company
7559508 it isnt as if they are really independent contractors who run their own businesses they have all the obligations of employees without any of the benefits of being employees they dont have access to workers compensation and other rights employees have
7559509 its gotten harder im looking for a part time job now
7559510 some guys are paying 50 or 60 a day for gas in some cases the leases are 130 per day that is 180 a day before you can receive even 1 profit
7559511 proportionally the lease today is less than it was 10 years ago if you take into consideration vehicle maintenance and the cost of insurance
7559512 being an independent contractor means you have no legal protection
7559513 if you and your cab company have a problem you cant go to the labor board and you cant go to the dot its just you against them
7559514 state law prevents you from starting your own company even if you work hard enough and have enough cash
7559515 you have to go before this board and that board is partly made up of officials from the cab companies so if you go to the board and they say no we dont need more cabs here more likely than not youre out of luck
7559516 that driver got here at 8 a m this morning
7559517 if you came back tonight at midnight he would still be here i guarantee it
7559518 i dont know what to do to prove necessity and convenience
7559519 what else do they want my customers all said they needed my services what do they want them to do cry
7559520 our company has 12 vans and other companies have vans
7559521 some companies have town cars which carry more luggage than the van
7559522 every new business wants to take work away from an existing company
7559523 thats what it means to start a new business they want to provide better service or market themselves differently or they want to pick up customers in areas where the company isnt doing a good job
7559524 its the exact equivalent of making burger king and mcdonalds fight over whether a city needs new fast food restaurants
7559525 if you and your cab company get into a fight or any beef you have nobody to protect you
7559526 if you do the work the dot will issue your permit
7559527 everybody in the country is getting screwed because of gas the drivers need to make a living if theyre paying 60 a day for gas its got to come from the customer
7559528 from what im hearing at least preliminarily there is a problem with the regulatory climate under the dot
7559529 there have been anecdotal reports of a dot regulator who was very responsive and aware of issues in the taxi program but he retired a couple of years ago in 2002 or 2003 since that time the regulatory climate at the dot hasnt been all that effective the people involved havent seemed all that knowledgeable or interested in the taxi industry that seems to be a theme ive heard from different drivers in the state
7559530 those with no right to be in the uk will be removed
7559531 surreys close proximity to london and the ongoing national threat means everyone has to play a part in keeping the county safe
7559532 an attack can come at any time at any place without any warning
7559533 crowded places with little or no protective security measures which means high streets and busy shopping centres such as main square in camberley are at risk

7559539 llevo pr cticamente toda mi vida viajando en avi n y nunca hab a vivido algo as no tengo palabras para definir esta experiencia
7559540 lo primero que se me pas por la mente es el reciente accidente en el aeropuerto de barajas
7559541 people think that this will be an easy fight for lamon not the case
7559542 esperamos que las nuevas herramientas del reciente paquete de medidas promovido para estimular la vivienda despierten una tendencia de crecimiento sostenido de las ventas en los meses venideros
7559543 plus color et plus direct plus proche du t l spectateur
7559544 a pesar de no ser una bajada considerable este dato marca el inicio de una tendencia positiva en un momento en que la morosidad de las entidades financieras est creando mucha tensi n en el mercado interbancario

7559547 creo que un referendo es crucial no s lo por la necesidad de obtener los puntos de vista de la gente sino porque mediante ste se educa a la poblaci n algo que permitir comprender qu es la epa
7559548 esta nueva posici n proporcionar a santa luc a y el resto del caricom un oportunidad para renegociar el acuerdo y centrarse en los aspectos m s pol micos
7559549 solicitamos que los l deres se re nan y debatan este asunto tan pronto como sea posible
7559550 en los m rgenes todav a hay casos donde existe peligro de hacer trampas en el sistema
7559551 esperamos que las nuevas herramientas del reciente paquete de medidas promovido para estimular la vivienda despierten una tendencia de crecimiento sostenido de las ventas en los meses venideros
7559552 if an economist tries to tell you where the stock market will be in a year you can safely ignore that but if he tells you a gas tax holiday is an unambiguously bad idea thats worth listening to especially if economists on both sides of the aisle agree
7559553 una cautela y una sensibilidad especial porque nos quedamos m s tranquilos acudiendo excepcionalmente aunque no vamos a hacerlo siempre que un md82 tenga un problema
7559554 some say dont be hasty with effort to curb eminent domain
7559555 if youre investigating or analyzing data then you should need a little more credentials than someone who just repairs computers
7559556 information through the review and analysis of and the investigation into the content of computer based data
7559557 if i bring my kids computer into a shop to see what hes been looking at online does that constitute an investigation
7559558 the review of computer data for the purpose of investigating potential criminal or civil matters is a regulated activity
7559559 theres clearly a live legal dispute here because theyve given us specific examples of what they say are regulated services
7559560 based on their public statements our clients are concerned and were seeking a declaration of our rights from the court
7559561 i dont care what it says if it had been dogs playing poker on the side of the building itd still be a problem
7559562 you cannot erect what amounts to a two story piece of graffiti
7559563 if this were advertising mcdonalds or beer or the cardinals thered be no discussion or debate
7559564 the city just cant stand that someone is protesting what theyre doing in such a loud way
7559565 it tells local governments youd better make sure youve done your homework before you try to take a property
7559566 when some of our tenants started getting letters from the city last year saying once again the city was interested in acquiring their homes i felt like something drastic needed to be done
7559567 ive had city officials tell me that if the mural were smaller and painted on the front of the building then itd be ok
7559568 provides information on the citys geography history historic sites historic structures historic objects or other places of interest
7559569 i f the department determines that the educational program and method of evaluating tour guides is equivalent to or exceeds the written examination required by this section
7559570 thats a pretty broad definition of content based as i understand it a tourist guide is required to pass the test no matter what subject matters he or she includes in his or her tour that looks a lot closer to content neutrality to me
7559571 any person who provides information on the citys geography history historic sites historic structures historic objects or other places of interest
7559572 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
7559573 the dcnr has the authority to regulate activities within its own parks
7559574 unfortunately for the camp pennsylvania law specifically and unequivocally prohibits all commercial activity in any state park without written permission of the dcnr
7559575 excluding the camp from rafting is about the financial interests of four commercial outfitters
7559576 the court ignored our constitutional argument that the government cannot interfere with your liberty unless it has a good reason and protecting commercial outfitters is not a good reason there is no evidence the camp was harming them no evidence the camp was unsafe or harming the environment
7559577 the life of the constitution depends on courts being willing to enforce constitutional rights
7559578 the essential feature of the camps trip down the river is moral instruction and that is completely absent in a commercial outfitter trip
7559579 its an important tradition that was seen as a rite of passage for campers
7559580 summers best two weeks has an outstanding safety record and all we want to do is what weve always done safely and peacefully raft the river
7559581 this unfortunate ruling denies our campers the powerful sense of accomplishment and lifelong memories that have been an integral part of our program for more than 30 years
7559582 because the owner clicked on a malware loaded kiddie porn site
7559583 and dont forget the it guys that cant get bonded due to a shady past but are technically competent who will turn to crime to feed their families
7559584 you disk is in order your seektimes should be better
7559585 for the foregoing reasons we vacate the trial courts judgment and remand with direction to enter judgment for the plaintiffs enjoining horne from expending public funds pursuant to the school voucher statutes
7559586 el parkinson es una enfermedad costosa que tiene una enorme carga para los cuidadores y la sociedad en general necesitamos gobiernos que se den cuenta de que tomar medidas para reducir esta carga asegur ndose de que las personas reciban los mejores cuidados y tratamiento disponible aporta los mejores beneficios en los entornos econ micos y sociales
7559587 hay casi 1 2 millones de personas que viven con parkinson en europa y con una poblaci n en fase de envejecimiento esta cifra seguro que aumentar es el momento de tratar las desigualdades en el cuidado y tratamiento de la enfermedad y mejorar las vidas de los afectados por parkinson ahora y en el futuro
7559588 siempre me impresiona c mo el parkisnon es tan visible socialmente y aparentemente invisible a la sociedad es una enfermedad dif cil y se necesita ayuda en europa esta iniciativa de la epda es crucial necesitamos mejorar la comprensi n necesitamos ampliar el perfil necesitamos personas no s lo para mirar sino para actuar
7559589 hemos intentado todo lo posible para salvar la coalici n para que la democracia floreciese en el pa s pero todos los esfuerzos han fallado
7559590 baby bull in march but am i the only one that questions whether part of the loss can be attributed to diaz overextending himself being a full time student is admirable and a great story for the sport but cant he go part time he cant get these years back especially the way he fights
7559591 what kills a skunk is the publicity it gives itself
7559592 if politicians and public figures could sue anyone who criticized them everyone in america would need a lawyer
7559593 under the first amendment you shouldnt need a lawyer to speak out about politics
7559594 insulted by the behavior of our elected officials and ashamed of their conduct
7559595 having to defend ourselves from the very government that was designed to protect and defend us as citizens the ability to protect what is rightfully ours depends on the right to speak freely
7559596 the leaf chronicle ad was an attempt by cprc to communicate with the people of clarksville and urge them to contact their council representatives and voice their opinion regarding the redevelopment plan and the enabling legislation of the ordinance
7559597 the information in the ad is accurate and factual this lawsuit is frivolous and threatens our civil liberties and first amendment rights
7559598 dont want anyone else playing in their sandbox and attempt to silence their critics with frivolous litigation we are involved because is not only our right but our obligation to be enlightened and engaged citizens
7559599 to stand in silence when they should protest makes cowards of men

7559654 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters
7559655 we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7559656 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7559657 too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream
7559658 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7559659 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7559660 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7559661 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7559662 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it
7559663 these are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex they are building more and more into their operating systems and with that comes more complexity and more challenges but what i think is most important here is the response
7559664 at this time we are confident there is little risk to fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed fedora packages

7559668 this redevelopment plan is about private development our city government is controlled by developers
7559669 mayor johnny piper councilman swift and ddp member wayne p wilkinson are all developers
7559670 designed to and did falsely attack the good reputations of wayne wilkinson and richard swift
7559671 but their response to that criticism belongs in the court of public opinion not a court of law
7559672 was brought to bear on certain councilmen to expedite matters
7559673 mere allegations that someone is using political clout to advance his self interest cannot have a defamatory meaning as a matter of law
7559674 theyre the cprc not implying that they wilkinson and swift were exerting pressure
7559675 what else but malice leads you to include wayne wilkinson and richard swift how was the public debate and discussion advanced in anyway
7559676 expressed an opinion that swift and wilkinson were utilizing their political clout to advance a plan that served their self interest
7559677 find me a politician in america who has never been criticized of acting in their own self interest
7559678 personally attacked for voicing my concerns all we stated was the truth
7559679 the only thing we had was to speak and now theyre attacking us for that
7559680 what we have here with this developer driven government is a group of thin skinned bullies that dont want anyone playing in their sandbox
7559681 all citizens have a first amendment right to speak out against government abuse without getting sued for their speech by the very people whose actions they are protesting

7559697 i just kept saying that this is too weird leo was like oh get over with it and i am going while i said yeah but a little reminder you are my best friend and he mendes is my husband so this is a bit weird
7559698 weve been working southbounders for the money and weapons that are going back to mexico
7559699 october 2001 105 000 november 2003 99 000 october 2004 668 000
7559700 weve helped the schools with cops in school and vehicles
7559701 i think every year weve bought three to four vehicles all of our equipment guns high powered rifles all bought with forfeiture funds
7559702 you dont want to take the money from any john doe
7559703 if you cant prove that its been a criminal activity reasonably suspicious probable cause you dont want to take it cause itll look bad in court
7559704 as i was driving south i noticed a dark bluish unmarked car that was taking radar he basically got behind me followed me for a while
7559705 he asked me to get out of the car i did
7559706 he asked me for my drivers license and insurance i gave it to him he asked me if i had weapons drugs or large amounts of money i told him i did
7559707 he suspected we were using the money to go south and buy drugs
7559708 so at that time we got in our car and we left still trying to figure out what just happened we got officers that took our cash we got officers that told us we cant get an attorney so im thinking are these guys officers of law did i just get robbed of my money
7559709 i believe a lot of these stops are fishing expeditions nothing more they figure they stop enough people out there that they can profile for whatever reason sooner or later they are going to hit on something
7559710 the laws are made now such that anybody that has cash seized from em the burden of proof shifts over to the person whose money is seized to prove that its legitimate money and frankly a lot of people dont want to declare they have a lot of cash for other reasons not related to drug trafficking
7559711 look man heres the deal were gon take this money into our possession ok
7559712 oh no im not giving you authority for you to take that money into your possession
7559713 they just told me it looked like drug money that was all
7559714 its an abuse of power and were not gonna let them hide behind their police powers and the legal system were gonna keep pursuing this until we get justice
7559715 it was my hard earned cash they had guns and badges and they just took it if i would have been a drug dealer i would have just left them and let them have the money
7559716 i can tell you i never see a complaint like this filed in the eastern district of virginia in fact even if they had loads of evidence theyd probably hesitate to file a complaint against 5 000 just because its a waste of time but to file it when theres so little evidence as in this case is really striking
7559717 something is rotten down there i can tell you that
7559718 i think a lot of people thought after passage of federal reform law that most if not all problems with civil forfeiture were solved and i simply dont think thats the case
7559719 theres still a lot of abuse there are large parts of the country where prosecutors can get away with bringing bad cases because judges tolerate them
7559720 that a drug trafficker whos bringing money from the u s to mexico whos carrying hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars in cash in their pickup truck who just sold dope and crack and cocaine to children in your playgrounds and his money is being taken away that troubles you
7559721 they open my car engine and they try to find something
7559722 but i dont have nothing in my engine and i dont know what they thinking after that they said they would take me to the office
7559723 i think maybe they see money like that maybe they thought i was dealing with the drugs how can a black man have this much money in his pocket i think they robbing me i cant understand they can stop someone and take his money
7559724 the deputies with all their training and experience were acting in good faith as sworn officers doing their job they were not trying to take mr annans hard earned money they were simply trying to verify that the 43 000 was not money made in a drug transaction
7559725 he didnt talk to anybody about putting his sign before he just did it he shot first and asked questions later
7559726 it was clearly illegal you dont have two story high signs in the city i dont care what they say it just happened to say something about imminent domain it could have said i hate the chicago cubs
7559727 attempting to shut down a protest of its abuse of eminent domain despite the fact that they didnt have any authority to do that makes what they did even more egregious
7559728 it certainly doesnt immunize them from any kind of legal liability
7559729 suggest case be submitted on governments brief unable to obtain any money from clients to be present and argue case
7559730 in the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a sawed off shotgun has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say that the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument
7559731 appropriation of public money in aid of private or sectarian schools
7559732 as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt fully mentally focused
7559733 i like to use the football field and practice and being around the guys as a place to get away but i still had something lingering
7559734 but weve handled it everyone has learned from their mistakes and were ready to move on
7559735 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7559736 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7559737 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder
7559738 it was tough to have a killer instinct when you have other things in your head
7559739 but after the preliminary hearing in may 2007 when no one testified against him and the judge still held him over that was the only time i saw a negative emotion
7559740 the message theyre sending is that football players can do whatever they want and theres no accountability
7559741 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7559742 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that
7559743 this year youre probably looking at 70 80 percent of them that are going to be that size at least 2 1 2 inches
7559744 if we get a little bit of water in the next week or so that could change theres still time for them to put some size on

7559751 d r belz the great ideas that never got off the ground catalog
7559752 whatever extension we get this program is going to end and i think everyone now understands that
7559753 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
7559754 the habeas process the court mandates will most likely end up looking a lot like the dta system it replaces
7559755 the test for determining the scope of the suspension clause must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain

7559757 it is always a risk to like someone it involves time patience and understanding to get someones heart to open up at times it will work other times it wont but thats why you call it a risk you invest something and theres a possibility you wont win however you still get something in return strength of heart and mind and the assurance that you wont have any regret from not trying
7559758 kung may balak kang gawin ngayon wag mo na ituloy para may gagawin ka pa bukas
7559759 hostility to private property rights and a resulting flight of capital that has largely drained the city of its economic lifeblood
7559760 what would have happened all over the city had the tax breaks given to the favored few been available everywhere to everyone
7559761 dumping ground for poor less educated people with a higher incidence of criminal behavior
7559762 you need some kind of tool to be able to accumulate the amount of land you need for massive redevelopment
7559763 every day we look out and see the value that resulted from its use
7559764 i know for sure for a fact im gonna break out this year
7559765 im gonna do what i do tell the people in philly to get ready i feel like theyve forgotten me i need love from my city
7559766 i cant say i was happy getting hurt but im glad it happened
7559767 the left knee thing went back to west catholic then it got worse at hargrave i never did anything about it ive been working so hard im in the best shape of my life
7559768 i had everything easy in high school this showed me the flip side this is giving me a whole different look at things with the struggles now i appreciate what it takes to be no 1
7559769 weve been battling all camp one things for sure im
7559770 when i get my turn im going to make it happen for myself my family my team and philadelphia thats who i play for i didnt have the success i was hoping for as a freshman sophomore or junior but this year dont even worry about it its gonna be nice
7559771 i wanted to get hit i was looking forward to it i wanted to see how id react
7559772 i broke off a pretty long run got tackled no problems it was a big weight off my shoulder im still good no aches no pains
7559773 hes got that philly mentality id put anything on the line for jim mckenzie and i know hed do the same for me even at his young age hes a leader hes one of the guys giving me confidence
7559774 seeing what hes doing that pushes me if i didnt think making the nfl was still possible for me i wouldnt be playing anymore this is hard work its what pushes me
7559775 if steve slaton can make the nfl curtis boonah brinkley can do it too
7559776 this makes no more sense than allowing burger king to have a say in whether a town needs a new mcdonalds
7559777 i think we would really try to keep him there
7559778 brayden comes first and i think it would be worth getting a loan and almost treating it like its college but it would be tough
7559779 now on the weekends he asks if he can go to school he loves it so much
7559780 otherwise there is no way they can afford to put their children here and they are so happy and doing so well and the families are so happy with their lives at home
7559781 no 1 the kids dont like change and no 2 theyre here because the public school system failed them bottom line thats just the reality and to put them back into an environment where theyve been bullied and teased and tortured
7559782 its going to disrupt our whole plan we were working really hard on getting her talking
7559783 two city officials showed up and said we are going to tear down your fence and put up a block wall
7559784 that would be my initial reaction that he would have a quite a strong case
7559785 under arizona law in order for a municipality to condemn land number 1 it must be for a public use and 2 it has to be necessary for that public use
7559786 no tax shall be laid or appropriation of public money made in aid of any church or private or sectarian school or any public service corporation
7559787 anyone who performs an investigation according to the state without a license is subject to up to a year in jail and 14 000 dollars in penalties
7559788 the private investigation industry obviously has grown and now we have people involved in private investigation work that do utilize computers and things of that nature
7559789 the lawsuit we filed today is challenging the effort by private investigators to have a law passed that now criminalizes perfectly legitimate computer repair work and makes criminals out of hard working men and women and their customers
7559790 quantifies the number of medicare part d plan enrollees in 2007 who reached the doughnut hole
7559791 we need somebody whos got the heart the empathy to recognize what its like to be a young teenage mom the empathy to understand what its like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old and thats the criteria by which im going to be selecting my judges
7559792 i intend to nominate judges who have proven themselves worthy of our trust that they take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the peoples elected representatives

7559796 the sports hernia where i go online to get my laughs
7559797 the sports hernia does what good satire should it makes you laugh hardest at yourself
7559798 i dont blame anyone in the public schools they can only do what the district and state allows them to do but it never helped my sons
7559799 they can only do what the district and state allows them to do but it never helped my sons
7559800 as these kids grow up the social gap between them and their peers becomes wider he has been subjected to teasing and bullying
7559801 my daughter is a typical kid and public school is just right for her she shines in that setting but that is not the case for all children including my son
7559802 i am aware the public schools are required to give every child a fair and appropriate education but the reality is that it is not happening for all special needs kids
7559803 no tax shall be laid or appropriation of public money made in aid of any church or private or sectarian school or any public service corporation
7559804 obviously we have a bit of a legal disagreement here with the ags office but the bottom line is that both horne and parents will be going to court to try to keep the scholarships going for this upcoming school year
7559805 there are many annoying and frustrating things about living in new york city but every once in a while they are balanced out by something incredible something that is completely unique to new york and only has the real impact the it does because it takes place here

7559810 we have 12 000 people on our forums theyre very active
7559811 there are a few hundred freelancers working on the site were open source no matter what our goal is to bring base line code that you can plug modules on top of it
7559812 the hold up is the availability in commercial volume of vdsl 2 modems which hampers our ability to pair bond
7559813 the reason for that approach is that east of the mississippi river most plant cables fiber optics etc are all buried the west is all buried plant
7559814 now contrast that with verizon you have a different story because most of verizons plant is aerial housed on telephone poles we cant afford to tear up everybodys neighborhood its not a question of desirability to fiber to the home its whats affordable to consumers qwest has 75 percent to 80 percent of its plant buried verizon is the total opposite
7559815 we could say well do 30 percent fiber to the home but we wouldnt have the same architecture
7559816 thirty mbps allows you 3 or four hd streaming channels and other information coming into the house
7559817 thats not deficient and meets demand at an attractive price we feel that qwest is future proof for most services unless theres something else like a killer app
7559818 the cable guys are playing a marketing game talking about peak speeds
7559819 if you have 100 mbps in peak speed and its going into a cable node of 500 homes and 150 subscribers are using the coax segment you have 150 customers sharing that stream video across all of it and you have a problem
7559820 with what we are doing with fiber to node the experience is far better
7559821 we should not be harming customer experience by picking and choosing what they see unless its illegal
7559822 we would not take p2p and restrict it its very valid our high end subscribers use p2p
7559823 what i think the industry goes to is a cap
7559824 we have no clue what application is taking place among customers but we do have flag reports
7559825 every carrier is using that approach as part of network management strategy
7559826 a thin layer of intelligence can provide real value to customers

7559833 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty

7559835 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7559836 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7559837 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7559838 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset

7559841 the board takes the position that dentistry is dentistry is dentistry
7559842 horse dentists remove teeth without the ability to prescribe antibiotics i dont know of anyone who would have a tooth removed without antibiotics
7559843 i think that if youre providing a service that affects the health of animals the public should have a recourse
7559844 because there is no legal licensing or regulation you could be an equine dentist tomorrow
7559845 texas absurd licensing scheme is a lose lose lose for entrepreneurs horse owners and horses
7559846 wrapped in its bureaucratic cocoon of arrogance and indifference the board acts with total disregard for the best interests and clearly expressed desires of the horse owning public
7559847 they want to come to school but are worried about being able to work the vets want to make it to where only they can do dentistry and i dont think thats right
7559848 they get eight hours of dentistry out of eight years of vet school
7559849 most of that is observation and anatomy our students get almost 300 hours before graduating
7559850 theres more to it than just filing off the edges
7559851 it seems like the vets are trying to use their license to say theyre the only ones who can do it its unfair and its a little deceiving to the public
7559852 grave digger look forward to working together with their new label napalm records we have observed the excellent work of the label in the past few years

7559856 they feel a lot more comfortable having the evidence to support them
7559857 more of their time can be spent in the room or adjacent to the room
7559858 vendors like hines dont get paid until the product is sold at the retail level if the plants remain unsold for any reason home depot does not pay considering the care plants receive at my local home depot i am not surprised that there are many unsold plants
7559859 wake up call here people stay away from the box stores if you want to stay in the business make those one on one relationships with the indy folks grow what they want and sell it at a price that they can also make a profit
7559860 its really geared toward the digital audience that wants to be the ultimate decider of what order they watch it
7559861 what it really is is a one stop shop for news fanatics about whats happening right now in the country and the world
7559862 although the investigations have not been completed and the department has not yet reached a conclusion with respect to all the alleged abuse and neglect of the more than 400 children involved in these cases numerous parties propounded interrogatories and other discovery requests
7559863 a copy of the motion was not provided to the undersigned attorney until the day after the department obtained an ex parte order from the court
7559864 all fail to require productive communication for the vast majority of cases
7559865 in a case with more than 140 mothers and 400 children all of whom have lawyers we maintain and hope to show at the hearing on sept 4 that formal discovery is virtually impossible
7559866 as it happens i am fine you did not hit me because i saw you but you did not see me and this could have been a very messy and terrible accident i could be dead or badly injured right now because you never even looked i am not going to tell you not to talk on the cell phone while youre driving i do that too everybody does note shastas future mother in law does not i am just going to suggest that from now on before you start moving your vehicle and before you start talking on the cell phone in a moving car that you take a moment to look around you and make sure youre not about to run over any little children or little old ladies or sarcastic young men
7559867 so you happy with that petell pick you up about eleven and take you over

7559880 thats where the villagers keep their animals common grazing ground and its also where the stocks are theyre not used now any trouble and you get carted over to portsmouth or sometimes winchester not much scope for trouble here really though everyones family of one sort or another so any bother gets sorted out by the families

7559902 obamas a much better choice than republican presidential candidate john mccain but im very concerned that he wants to go into places like afghanistan and pakistan in a war like way
7559903 i wish we had more of a seat at the table and were allowed inside the zone without being put in a cage
7559904 i would like to see the democratic party stand up for the policies it said it would stand up for
7559905 we had two choices to try to do something or to do nothing
7559906 we had a set of standards it was a crime to let them sit on a shelf
7559907 of no value if your concern is security against insider threats
7559908 as just the epitome of how government money goes down a rat hole
7559909 were not going to sacrifice any of our stringent requirements to satisfy election administrators or manufacturers

7559912 he wants to be the best performer on the show if he cant live up to that he wont do a match if he can be the old stone cold then youll see him wrestle at wrestlemania xxv
7559913 there are a lot of fun stories told here beyond just the usual tidbits of telling his story as a wrestler some of the stuff added in focuses on his family life the mr perfect vignettes and much more by the end of the documentary you really are going to have a whole new level of appreciation for mr perfect i found myself trying to walk around and whack the gum as it came flying out of my mouth later in the day needless to say it isnt easing being perfect

7559918 sitting in such good company on this blue and beneficent day i am glad angus
7559919 very glad but i still feel what i felt before we came what this place meant to me as a boy has vanished from here it did so the day i left these great trees did not shade me back then the grass under our feet and the water beyond in the mere are not mine i carry all i have ever owned with me
7559920 i know i take pleasure in remembering what we did as lads even if you did cast me as the loyal populace and yourself as the strict autocrat
7559921 you must forgive me for that jim i took my duties as the young master of this domain seriously
7559922 a man could see the whole world in a solitary lifetime at such a pace one day there will be railways that run to the very limits of the earth
7559923 the scene of your coming big day eh jim is this old heathen still invited
7559924 quite easily it seems but if this winded horse has the earth under his feet rather than on his nose hell happily see you wed
7559925 such talk theres no point in thinking things of that sort we live and trust in god there is nothing else
7559926 im sorry angus take no notice of me trust away
7559927 you make light of my belief and belief is all we have
7559928 yes you are right no reason for us to argue yet again answers will come in one way or another but i believe too you know i have not convinced you and it seems i never will but you must allow me that god is not absent from my world god is the world ive stared god in the face my whole life and felt the glory of it it is here with us now it is all around us you only have to look you only have to look
7559929 i say frankly on a private level that i always intend to stay true to these statements i do always say what i actually feel at that time after each metal gear when i say i am going to move on to the next project but its like when hayao miyazaki says he is not going to do more and then always ends up doing it i think i am kind of in a similar situation i have ideas other than metal gear and i want to go on to make other new games but for political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return but i have to say my feeling hasnt changed i would like to pass on the metal gear series to younger staff members and then go on to produce the title and not be so attached to it
7559930 storytelling is very difficult but adding the flavor helps to relay the storytelling meaning in a cutscene with a set camera and effects you can make the users feel sorrow or make them happy or laugh this is an easy approach which we have been doing that is one point the second point is that if i make multiple storylines and allow the users to select which story this might really sacrifice the deep emotion the user might feel when theres a concrete storyline and you kind of go along that rail you feel the destiny of the story which at the end makes you feel more moved but when you make it interactive if you want multiple stories where you go one way or another will that make the player more moved when he or she finishes the game these two points are really the key which i am thinking about and if this works i think i could probably introduce a more interactive storytelling method
7559931 tiger williams ive covered the super bowl nba finals and stanley cup finals ive had former bears lineman stan thomas act like he was going to squeeze my head like a zit ive interviewed roger clemens hank aaron and donald trump ive been cursed at by mike keenan ive watched denis savard go into the hockey hall of fame ive been yelled at by bill wirtz i talked sports with ben affleck at the world series of poker and i cry almost every time i see jim craig skate up the ice looking for his dad in the stands as the 1980 u
7559932 trade only goods that physically exist no virtual items such as software licenses or wow accounts
7559933 your governments historic commitment to lead on global warming in europe and around the world
7559934 as proposed these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the uks carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult if not impossible building new conventional plants and setting the uk up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the us all the more difficult
7559935 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair
7559936 as a live planning case i cannot comment on the merits or otherwise or on the timing of any decision
7559937 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
7559938 nous avons tous la responsabilit de sauver notre pays du stade actuel
7559939 i mean edwards knew that in effect he wouldnt be elected president the story was out there it might be kind of interesting if somebody some contributor would bring a class action suit on behalf of all these people who essentially were led to send money to a many under totally false circumstances false pretenses ive seen a lot of class action suits than this particular case
7559940 that girl could wash her hair with a brillo pad and it would still look good
7559941 looks like someone had a little trouble parkin their boat
7559942 eso no te pasar a si te acostaras a tu hora
7559943 no tomes pastillas para dormir porque sino a los 40 a os ser peor
7559944 but this just feels almost unseemly to me its non stop to the point where it feels like political idolatry or something i dont remember ever feeling like any one politician is just being lobbed at me incessantly like this
7559945 you cant just say its x86 so its going to solve the massively parallel computing problem
7559946 with an os they dont control and applications coming from everywhere
7559947 theyve put out a certain amount of technical disclosure in the past five weeks
7559948 but although they make larrabee sound like its a fundamentally better approach it isnt they dont tell you the assumptions they made they talk about scaling but they disregard memory bandwidth they make it sound good but we say you neglected half a dozen things
7559949 every gpu we make we always consider this type of design we do a reasoned analysis and we always conclude no thats why we havent built that type of machine
7559950 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much
7559951 its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7559952 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics
7559953 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much
7559954 its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7559955 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics
7559956 youre working out what you can really afford to put on a cpu and youre selling it to a customer who doesnt care the economics dont make sense
7559957 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics
7559958 no idea maybe she was hoping youd say that you were dying to see her again so that you can ravish her repeatedly or something
7559959 nous avons tous la responsabilit de sauver notre pays du stade actuel
7559960 i used to get a lot more on the right
7559961 if youre a little bit critical of barack obama you get really a pie of vilification right in the face
7559962 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7559963 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7559964 california will give barack obama and joe biden the biggest victory in the history of our country the most votes ever for a presidential candidate are you ready to come together in unity and support barack obama and joe biden i bring this up because reporters ask me all day about this but as we gather here remember its not just about us and what our feelings are about the campaigns its about the hopes aspirations and challenges of the american people and they are looking to us to come out of this convention with unity organized and focused to take this country in a new direction we owe them that this is about our country
7559965 if people want to talk about drilling offshore dont come around california with that kind of talk lets talk about the connection between oil which belongs to the people and the record profits from the oil companies and how they take it out of the ground with no royalties in california
7559966 a little over a year ago i was in maximum security prison solitary confinement now im out and were talking about putting karl rove in
7559967 this is not about me this is about restoring justice and preserving our democracy

7559970 i just had some subcutaneous fat injected into my penis to increase its girth so thats pretty good
7559971 the hunting of the president the 10 year campaign to destroy bill and hillary clinton
7559972 i thought get over yourself i had literally written out a check to the obama campaign and then i saw him in front of an evangelical group in anaheim
7559973 my partner looked over at me and we tore up the check
7559974 if we always vote for the lesser of two evils if we accept their crumbs and platitudes if we write checks to candidates who dont stand up for us arent we being self destructive
7559975 obama is much more gay friendly than hillary ever was
7559976 people vote for a person if they know the person if they trust the person if they believe the person is going to strive to find pragmatic solutions to problems
7559977 do not have anything in common with obamas liberal policies
7559978 because i assume barack obama is going to be president for eight years
7559979 i hope no one is going to leave not unified at the end of this week because we are going to come together and get this done

7559983 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7559984 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office
7559985 they took our pensions it wasnt right so were trying to find somebody to take their place to help us win the fight for the working people
7559986 we are confident that we are well positioned to continue serving the columbian clients and communities
7559987 hey im as surprised as you all are to be running with a darkie but i have to tell you hes one of the good ones like cosby or byron allen hes like the new family friendly ice cube not the old angry ice cube that your daughter would date to get back at you for not buying her that mini cooper she wanted

7559996 how does this fit within the whole context of gods revealed word
7559997 the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul
7559998 and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him
7559999 according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries
