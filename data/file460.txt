4600000 well that doesnt make any sense and anyway by that logic hitler should be here somewhere shouldnt he
4600001 well some people are so far gone that they couldnt enjoy being here since there is no sadness here they just cant be here
4600002 mark this cant really be heaven this must be a test
4600003 i dont like it here any kind of heaven that allows a terrorist in is not the kind of heaven i want to be a part of
4600004 you said yourself that theres no unhappiness here well im unhappy there must be someplace else i can go
4600005 but if you just give it a little more time
4600006 it would only help convince me further that i need to leave you can look at it however you like but i know myself and i know my god and i just dont belong in a place like this i dont think he does either
4600007 and there arent all sorts of people like there are here

4600015 i will presidente and then i have one for you
4600016 so there i was a senator in a country trying to resurrect itself having dinner in washington d c one evening at the inter american development bank
4600017 what project would you like us to fund here in the name of the bank
4600018 we know what we want to do with the money
4600019 you didnt understand what you need are improvements like electricity running water sewers telephone and telegraph
4600020 everyone plays a musical instrument on sundays after mass we all gather for la retreta a concert in the church patio first we make music together after that we can talk about problems in our community and how to resolve them but our instruments are old and falling apart without music so will we
4600021 europe will be there next year its not going anywhere when are you going to get another chance to do anything like this
4600022 juanita asked if so what did this have to do with her the traditional country music of the colombian
4600023 tell me gustavo how do composers creative passions which are born of random nonlineal emotion deal with the structure of music which is mathematical and therefore lineal
4600024 as what happens at gaviotas people who dare to build a utopia use the same materials available to anyone but they find surprising ways to combine them thats exactly what composers do with the twelve tones of the scale like you theyre dreamers in a dream you arent limited by what is assumed to be permissible or possible
4600025 utopia literally means no place in greek the prefix u signifies no we call gaviotas a topia because its real weve moved from fantasy to reality from utopia to topia someday you need to come see it
4600026 dont wait to retire come sooner youre exactly what we need
4600027 ive been studying the history and literature of utopic communities
4600028 neither were any of those other places they were attempts
4600029 was taught to sing or to play a musical instrument music was the loom that wove the community together music was in school at meals even at work musicians accompanied laborers right into the corn and yerba mate fields theyd take turns some playing some harvesting it was a society that lived in constant harmony literally its what we intend to do right here in this forest thats why i asked you to come
4600030 do you have any idea how perfect a place this is to make music
4600031 and suddenly i realized that i could hear distant voices as though they were amplified i clapped my hands then i yelled i made lugari whisper theres incredible resonance in there we dont know why maybe the forest canopy vibrates maybe it has to do with the physics of unorganized spaces paolo wants an engineering student to write a thesis about the effect i just want to build a bandshell to focus it
4600032 probably need to encase the whole thing in mosquito netting too
4600033 theres no such thing as sustainable technology or economic development without sustainable human development to match
4600034 over twenty five years gaviotas has accomplished much but we need so much more
4600035 now i know for certain that we live in paradise
4600036 so now gaviotas will become a choir of angels when i went there the first time
4600037 i merely saw prophets but i have a weakness for prophets like you who preach in a desert it was like id heard a message i immediately wanted to convert all colombia into a gaviotas
4600038 i never thought that the process we began would be completed during just one presidential term over three or four decades peace was systematically destroyed in our country it was like an ovillo a ball of wool that had been unraveling for years to pretend that one could roll it up in four years would have been an illusion but we had to start somewhere

4600042 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4600043 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions

4600048 much of what is now considered hip hop is pure garbage that has transformed the american dream into a living nightmare

4600090 rhythm and blues and shaped the careers of stars such as ray charles and aretha franklin has died aged 91 a record company said today
4600091 the history of atlantic records and of sound of contemporary music would be very different without the impact that jerrys great ears uncanny intuition and true genius had on countless artists and their music atlantic said
4600092 he will be deeply missed by those who knew him and more importantly by the millions who knowingly or unknowingly have heard his phenomenal body of work
4600093 rhythm and blues before joining atlantic as a partner in 1953
4600094 dusty in memphis album and later he and ertegun signed led zeppelin to atlantic
4600095 he understood music and musicians in a way few label executives did and was able to inspire them to do their best and most original work atlantic said
4600096 our condolences go out to jerrys family and friends during this sad and difficult time
4600097 the guy in the middle who is neither an engineer nor a musician but an ear to hear what is happening
4600098 you keep it rolling you know the choices that must be made he said in my analysis the final determination is that if you cant go out and change the music you arent a producer you are merely presiding at a happening
4600099 i think its fair to say that 2007 marked the tipping point as far as mobile music adoption was concerned far more subscribers began downloading and subscribing to music content in developed markets and it must be said that that the publicity surrounding the iphone launch undoubtedly contributed to consumer awareness of mobile music services per se
4600100 with some operators now offering full track downloads at a comparable price to itunes there is little justification for a ringtone retail price point that is in many cases two or even three times this level
4600101 furthermore those aggregators whose portfolios are largely dependent upon the polyphonic ringtone will be unable to survive in the medium term unless they both rethink their pricing strategies and substantially diversify their product portfolios

4600193 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government

4600202 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4600203 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4600204 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic

4600697 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4600698 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game

4600763 the cooperation of all of these agencies made operation loccust the huge success that it was
4600764 the national park service alone would not have been able to attack this problem with the ferocity and resources that this cooperative effort was able to provide
4600765 it was a real honor to have the opportunity to work with sheriff wittman and his staff
4600766 the professionalism and hard work that went into the planning and implementation of this operation was outstanding operation loccust did send a clear message to drug trafficking organizations that tulare county will not allow our public lands to be ruined or used to grow marijuana

4600775 every age creates as an utopian image a nostalgic rear view mirror image of itself which puts it thoroughly out of touch with the present the present is the enemy the present is the and this will delight you norman the present is only faced in any generation by the artist the artist is prepared to study the present as his material because it is the area of challenge to the whole sensory life and therefore it is anti utopian it is a world of anti values and the artist who comes into contact with the present produces an avant garde image that is terrifying to his contemporaries

4600812 together we are embarking on a project that will not only impact the ethnic make up of the healthcare system but undoubtedly increase the quality of care provided to the minority populations that are underserved by the current system
4600813 increasing the number of nurses from underrepresented minority groups is a key strategy for addressing health disparities
4600814 the fact that we are talking about a partnership between a top hispanic serving institution and an historically black university illustrates and solidifies the union of dr louis sullivan and the healthcare industry as a top priority
4600815 to offer quality healthcare to someone you have to be able to efficiently communicate with them and understand their social needs
4600816 weve found that this is more easily accomplished when a healthcare professional shares the same ethnic background as their patient
4600817 fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4600818 the impression given to the voters is that this is a guarantee that the eliminated local taxes will be permanently replaced by new state revenue on a permanent basis the proposed amendment does not do this

4600827 my thing was to try to get the men back over here during the month because the women come here every day
4600828 today the risk is very small its a warning sign
4600829 could new devices be hackable we have no definitive evidence to suggest one way or the other but we expect the risks to increase as wireless ranges increase
4600830 its important to understand the risks so you can protect against them
4600831 today the chance of a patients implantable cardioverter defibrillator being reprogrammed by a malicious hacker is remote and the safety and benefit of these devices outweigh the current risk of this kind of interference
4600832 we think its important to think about these types of things
4600833 we dont want to leave ourselves and our patients vulnerable
4600834 its never happened in the real world you would literally have to be standing on top of somebody to make this work

4600839 mr murtha was playing into the hands of the enemy and putting the u s government stamp of approval on what the enemy was doing
4600840 i disagree with that because the role of a politician is not to follow public opinion but to lead it
4600841 were treating our natural resources as though they are a biohazard
4600842 there are a lot of people who are saying its time for a change
4600843 ive heard that from democrats who voted for jack for 20 or 30 years
4600844 this has been an ongoing discussion in the community for about three months
4600845 we were very impressed with the work that houlton has completed in regards to a similar affordable housing project in that community and we are exploring the feasibility of a similar type of project here in st agatha
4600846 in a criminal investigation only a judge or a prosecutor can issue a subpoena duces tecum

4600849 the actual employees can shoot these animals in lieu of wages
4600850 with the economic meltdown these guys are getting paid about seven us dollars a month way below the poverty line they shoot the animals and sell the meat to the locals
4600851 the people have to survive there s no food in the market so what are they going to do they are going to shoot the animals that you can understand but this is something else where is it there s a market somewhere and somebody s buying all the stuff
4600852 it is heartbreaking that the wildlife is paying the biggest price of all in the economic collapse of this country
4600853 elephant numbers appear to be stable or currently slightly increasing in zimbabwe at the moment
4600854 we have never had any reason to think they have something to hide
4600855 it s clearly a country that s under a lot of pressure from a variety of directions i m sure they are up against it in places given the socio economic problems there it would be astonishing if there wasn t poaching taking place
4600856 the poaching of elephants is just as much motivated by a desire to acquire the meat as it is to acquire ivory
4600857 it s certainly true that zimbabwe every year kills a large number of elephants as part of problem animal control but i wouldn t have thought it was 1 800
4600858 if zimbabwe has decided to engage in culling to control its stocks that s a matter for zimbabwe they are completely entitled to do that
4600859 eugenics is the study of agencies under social control which may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations either physically or mentally
4600860 in the first great enthusiasm for eugenics liberals were prominently to the fore
4600861 i t would appear that by contemporary standards eugenics was one of the least sexist fields of the day in a number of countries
4600862 humanitarian legislation or practice requires to be supplemented and its inevitable evil effects emphasis added counteracted by eugenic practice and ultimately by eugenic legislation
4600863 that the great condition of the decline of any civilization is the inadequacy of the qualities of the people who are bearers of it
4600864 may we do nothing to permit our blood to be adulterated by the infusion of blood of a lower grade
4600865 eugenics in its early years exerted a broad influence upon american thought as a sort of scientific reform among the many other reforms of the progressive era
4600866 the great problem of civilization is to secure a relative increase of the valuable as compared with less valuable or noxious elements in the population this problem cannot be met unless we give full consideration to the immense influence of heredity
4600867 the major factor in the decline of eugenics was undoubtedly hitlerism
4600868 we used to think that our fate was in the stars now we know that in large measure our fate is in our genes
4600869 i am determined to take advantage of these things im going to win and im going to do it now
4600870 im going to get up every single day and make some progress on this issue thats so important
4600871 if the important project starts taking up additional time leaders with a sense of urgency know to get low priority stuff off their calendars

4600893 many of the people from the highest reaches of the party told me that they felt theyd made a mistake and they wanted to make it right if they want to win the riding i dont think they couldve gone any other way
4600894 i think the essence of a vibrant national party is you would have to encompass a wide range of views probably one of the worst things is a monolithic party where everybody stands up and nods at the same time and says the same things
4600895 i strongly believe that we have to open up the party to the ordinary people the grassroots and we have to touch a chord if were going to be effective as a national party
4600896 going to have to do something very different than the way its been done if were going to get beyond having a single member from this province
4600897 it has been announced that tomorrow im going to replace asadullah khalid

4600900 there was a question to maybe have a new governor
4600901 afghanistan is a sovereign state that makes its own decisions about government appointments i can assure you that canada fully respects this and is not calling for any changes to the afghan government
4600902 there remain very serious allegations against the former governor that he may have been directly and personally involved in serious human rights violations including torture
4600903 like all other government positions in afghanistan there are changes being made randomly at a times when its necessary
4600904 today i am sitting on my chair being a provincial police chief and next time there will be someone else

4600906 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4600907 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4600908 however i would be satisfied if apple makes it possible for me to register an apple care protection plan after the 1 year warranty period furthermore i could also figure me to participate up to 50 of the repair costs
4600909 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
4600910 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position
4600911 shuttleworth main point was that linux and use of ubuntu was on the rise he also had lots of interesting things to say about open evolution after myspace amp facebook comes
4600912 i see my colleague preston gralla is looking for the best linux for a windows pro thats a good question with several good answers
4600913 the difference is that the linux install 101 or how i helped build refurbished linux pcs f
4600914 building and using linux based pcs is a rewarding and fullfilling pastime for open source enthusiasts but spreading the gospel to microsoft has serious plans to do away with windows
4600915 the plans which are far from being finalized indicate the microsoft is really running scared of mac os and linux on the desktop
4600916 in my last article i looked at gaming on ubuntu linux and concluded that it is alive and well
4600917 i see my buddy in technology writing preston gralla is having trouble getting his new wubi based ubuntu 8 04 system to work with the end run around the os is underway
4600918 the operating system may be losing its luster in fact you could argue that the operating system linux os x and windows will become an vaster than empires and more slow
4600919 i should know better by now but it still amazes me how brazen some freeloaders can be the only burden on anyone who wanted to gaming on ubuntu linux
4600920 after my last few articles on how to connect ubuntu linux to network shares and a network printer i want to have a look at some of the
4600921 i wonder what your son and grandkids think of muslims knowing your opinion of them islamaphobic perhaps
4600922 its difficult to know where to start in attacking this ridiculous viewpoint do you honestly think that white kids wont encounter hate prejudice etc simply as a result of your nightmare multiethnic society middle class liberal types arent filled with hate except when its aimed at working class whites and yet they keep diversity at arms length scummy leftist collaborators such as yourself can never give a single valid reason why white people should embrace such a society you describe yourself as old is this true any chance youll to croak soon itd be a cause for much merriment at the rwb if you could manage it before the weekend
4600923 but with little leverage in the face of an emboldened moscow washington and its friends have been forced to face the uncomfortable reality that their options are limited to mainly symbolic measures such as boycotting russian hosted meetings and events that may have little or no long term impact on russias behaviour the officials said

4600925 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
4600926 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
4600927 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
4600928 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
4600929 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
4600930 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
4600931 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
4600932 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
4600933 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
4600934 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
4600935 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
4600936 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
4600937 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
4600938 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
4600939 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
4600940 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
4600941 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
4600942 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
4600943 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
4600944 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
4600945 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
4600946 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
4600947 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
4600948 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
4600949 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
4600950 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out

4600952 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4600953 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4600954 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4600955 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4600956 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday

4600958 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4600959 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4600960 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee

4600962 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4600963 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4600964 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4600965 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4600966 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4600967 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4600968 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4600969 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4600970 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view

4600974 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments

4601016 hey i think you broke a pipe theres water coming through the ceiling downstairs
4601017 the dominance of english teams will be less than last year because real madrid barcelona ac milan not this year but in other years and inter will not just sit and watch the champions league
4601018 i was at the ajax tournament and inter had 18 players out on the bench they needed another bench for the players who were not involved
4601019 when i looked at the 10 names who were not involved they were 10 real names and patrick vieira wasnt even on it
4601020 basically we balance the budget in the way we run the club
4601021 i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with that target i think every manager should do this
4601022 we have gone three or four years into a different policy of bringing on our own players which we have to see through
4601023 but i am convinced we have opted for stability with young players who have spirit of our game the spirit of our club
4601024 every season is a season when you have to win something
4601025 but the difference between winning and losing is very small at the moment
4601026 for me the two massive trophies are the premier league and the champions league we were close in both competitions last season so lets go and try again we want to win things but had we made 70 points and won the carling cup people would have said for me it is not satisfying
4601027 we will not play every year like last year and lose out in the end
4601028 i love you too but im gonna have to mace you both in the face
4601029 i think you always want to buy the players at the right price
4601030 when you want to move a club forward as i think i have done here in the last 10 years some investment is needed not only to buy players but to spot players when they are not necessarily stars the quality of a manager is as well to develop players
4601031 for example when we bought adebayor who was thinking that he is a great player we bought him for what you can call at the time a reasonable price
4601032 but it is not necessarily linked with the price of the players it is linked with the how well the player develops how good he becomes and then you assess the situation of the player once he plays
4601033 manchester united are in the 20 30 million bracket of the market chelsea are in an unlimited bracket and we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd
4601034 of course i have made mistakes there are players i should have done but none at 30m

4601094 i have every intention of running in 2010 and hopefully will be running with mayor abramson at that time for a full four year term
4601095 ive known about this for two or three months now that irv maze was going to be getting this appointment and so if i knew about it for two months then i know they knew about it longer
4601096 we handled that process and that appointment the way weve handled every other appointment
4601097 we take our time we make sure were doing the right thing
4601098 to label his appointment as that of a crony demonstrates that this gentleman has little knowledge of me the mayor and this process
4601099 i would say if i was a crony i wouldnt say i was a crony

4601102 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
4601103 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
4601104 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest
4601105 there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
4601106 what russia really wants is essentially to be able to do as it pleases in world affairs and to answer to nobody
4601107 it wants a totally free hand particularly in and around the cis it also needs to conjure up the idea of an enemy to justify its regime the fact of the matter is that the most immediate threat here is to georgia because the russian government could pack forces into the north caucasus to threaten georgia
4601108 we heard statements that the russian railroad troops that had entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there on a humanitarian mission and now we know the truth about why those forces were there it was to rebuild the railroad to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
4601109 i am afraid that there is a very strong possibility that military activity will happen this year probably in the next month
4601110 this is a war that russia wanted and clearly had planned for
4601111 the evidence ive seen indicates that the russian army was sitting there waiting for this that this was essentially a provocation launched by the south ossetians who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the georgians who are easily provokable obviously to attack
4601112 and the russians were waiting there ready with an operational plan and with forces in place land sea and air to do what they have subsequently done
4601113 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
4601114 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
4601115 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility
4601116 its to elect a democrat to run for president of the united states
4601117 its not some extravaganza out there theres actually a lot of work to be done

4601121 its more right to use his campaign funds than taxpayer dollars

4601123 i dont know if we are the most effective civic group ever as one member of the constituency for change declared but we have absolutely moved philadelphia in the positive direction
4601124 of course our full speed ahead advocacy has ruffled some feathers among the connected and contented crowd but our approach has been to speak for philadelphia not for the special interests and to break free from the go along to get along mentality that had doomed philadelphia to decades of decline

4601130 so there are some very modern elements to the album and its mixed and mastered the way a record needs to be now but again its a total concept album i wanted to make something like a pink floyd record where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey

4601157 is you have an expert witness from the music publishing world talking about had jackson browne granted permission what would the license fee have been given his stature the famousness of the song and the use of it in this case jackson doesnt give permission for commercials which means the value had he done it would have been very high
4601158 the ohio republican party prepared the ad as an agent for and in concert with the national party and john mccain
4601159 ohio as you know is a key battleground state in the election and google lists plenty of examples of the close relationship between the national party and the ohio party our information and belief is that none of the state parties are sending stuff out that has not been approved by the national campaign and particularly in a key battleground state its inconceivable to us that this ad was done without the knowledge and consent of the mccain campaign
4601160 but i dont believe for a second that barack obamas campaign would have taken a jackson browne song and used it without his permission jackson has played concerts for barack obama they know each other
4601161 y prepared the ad as an agent for and in concert with the national party and john mccain
4601162 jackson has played concerts for barack obama they know each other
4601163 im entitled to wealth created by others because its not fair others have more than me
4601164 of course some people wont make the distinction which is why mccains administration should be preventing this sort of thing from happening just one more fumble for mccain and his gaggle do you really think this man can run a country
4601165 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
4601166 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
4601167 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts

4601228 these are small employers they are not sophisticated people they are trying to start a business and create jobs for people
4601229 there are whole industries in new york in which violations are the norm and labor law compliance is unusual
4601230 what we want to do is change the culture with our enforcement efforts change the culture so that compliance becomes the norm
4601231 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4601232 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4601233 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4601234 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4601235 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4601236 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4601237 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4601238 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4601239 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4601240 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier

4601250 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4601251 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4601252 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4601253 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4601254 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4601255 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4601256 who are open to doing something on the production side
4601257 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4601258 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

4601266 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4601267 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4601268 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4601269 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4601270 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4601271 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4601272 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4601273 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4601274 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4601275 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4601276 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4601277 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4601278 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4601279 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4601280 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4601281 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4601282 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4601283 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4601284 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4601285 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4601286 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4601287 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4601288 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4601289 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4601290 it is not a regular dictionary approved by any university or a pundit of linguistics it is a modern concept aimed at demolishing the man made language barrier and thereby fuelling mutual understanding and co operation among people from all over northeast india
4601291 we are more interested in inclusion of words in everyday use
4601292 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4601293 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4601294 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4601295 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4601296 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4601300 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4601301 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4601302 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4601303 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4601304 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4601305 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4601306 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4601307 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4601308 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4601313 it was good to practice against them because youre not used to the way they do it which is a great way to do it obviously theyve done it that way for a long time
4601314 the technique that we teach to them if they do that technique against a team like this the denver offense will run them right off the field so we have to literally get hooked so to speak and come on up the field
4601315 i just want him to get used to the defense and getting used to playing
4601316 you know hes a little rusty on defense and we have two more preseason games that id like to see him return some especially at home starting out
4601317 mike shanahan sees the benefit of it and we do too mike initiated it because we were set up to play last year i really like this playing denver home and home because we are different styles and helps both teams
4601318 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4601319 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4601320 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4601321 we forget we are friends if we dont have contact isolation doesnt work for anyone
4601322 i dont think its about winning its about playing and being with other kids
4601323 even though were so different the kids here love baseball as much as we do
4601324 its kind of hard because its like charades to figure out what guys are saying
4601325 this game was just like a battle to see whos going to fight to the end
4601326 actually we enjoyed it because we played so badly in the first few minutes
4601327 human is my most personal album to date i have grown so much since my last album being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe with this new chapter of my life it feels good to have rodney a familiar face by my side again he brings out emotions in me like nobody else
4601328 it feels good to be back in the lab with brandy again weve always made great records and im humbled and honored to be continuing our legacy the sound might be new bigger and more uplifting but weve kept our musical promise by making great songs and great music once again there is no musical combination like ours
4601329 a real life mirror of brandy as a woman an artist a musician and a performer communicating what it means to be fully
4601330 it is in line with what lower first rounders signed for already this year
4601331 his signing bonus includes our covering all four years of a college education
4601332 were excited that ownership gave us the resources to sign talent that was way above where they were drafted
4601333 we knew that drafting 29th overall in each round we had to find ways to be creative in getting players we feel weve accomplished that
4601334 i makes everyone feel like they still have a chance and i think thats a wonderful thing
4601335 we might not have a chance but we think we have a chance so thats half the battle im thinking maybe theres an outside chance you never know
4601336 im driving the ball in the fairway hitting a lot of good iron shots making some putts
4601337 as a coach you always want three points of course and we were well on the way but overall i think it was a fair result
4601338 in the situation we are in with a lot of young players and the late arrival of so many players who were involved in euro 2008 then i think we have to be happy
4601339 the opening spell was almost paradoxical because we should have scored at the start and then straight away we were a goal down from a move that began with a throw in
4601340 it was the worst possible scenario especially when youre playing away at bayern munich so to come back from that and get a point youre always going to be happy
4601341 its just a lot of fun like it was with the national team theres a lot of adrenaline but as a coach you dont want anything different
4601342 its hard to compare the feeling at this arena with anything because its one of the best in the world
4601343 there are perhaps a few like it in england such as manchester uniteds but we coaches love the pressure anyway otherwise we wouldnt do the job
4601344 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the offseason
4601345 but hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4601346 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far police inspector cornelius charles said
4601347 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4601348 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far police inspector cornelius charles said
4601349 an even greater percentage of voters than in june now see mccain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
4601350 i dont know where he stands he may be good he may not be but its hard to tell because he is not specific enough
4601351 the reason the polls are close is partly because of the sense of antagonism that obama might serve interests other than white interests and the doubt about should you really take a risk on someone who is very different from us
4601352 most american voters will vote for a president they perceive as being like them
4601353 small businesses have traditionally been the engine that has driven our economy out of recession
4601354 we dont get credit for that and neither party seems focused on the interests of small businesses
4601355 so far theres just not been much in the way of specifics to see where obama or mccain would go on issues that are important to small business
4601356 then after the campaign we get put back in the closet for another four years
4601357 im an entrepreneur and i want politicians to stay out of my way so i can get on with my work
4601358 john mccain will get in my way but less so than barack obama
4601359 20 year reign as the number one problem for small business owners
4601360 both presidential candidates have said their health care proposals take the needs of small business into account and thats a good start
4601361 the sba has almost been wiped out by funding cuts under the current administration
4601362 this is tremendous news the fact 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4601363 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time
4601364 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4601365 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4601366 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4601367 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4601368 were just absolutely delighted that they put suzanne lyall on this one the law of 2003 was suzannes law those are two federal laws and you know every time that they do that and every time the name is brought up somebody is going to remember that shes still missing
4601369 this bill isnt going to be the solution to all problems its not going to automatically make campuses more safe but i thin its a step in the right direction
4601370 to help other families basically thats the bottom line we want other families to have the same info that we have gathered over the years right away we didnt have in the beginning
4601371 i already have several of his cars that did not win the 500 i will wait for the daytona 500 winner car
4601372 the fact that the nra feels compelled to plant spies in organizations like ours borders on paranoia it reminds me of the days when general motors spied on ralph nader when he was trying to make automobiles safer
4601373 if they are doing this in an organization like ceasefirepa it makes you wonder what they might be doing in harrisburg where they have had so much influence in thwarting common sense handgun safety reforms
4601374 our members including some who have lost loved ones to handgun violence have been violated by this breach of trust we will not allow the nra to undermine our efforts to make our communities safer places to live

4601421 he got a bootleg copy of our video from a friend who wouldnt shut up about our presentation and he wanted to see what all the fuss was about

4601428 the primary culprit in marine environments is nitrogen and nowadays the biggest contributor of nitrogen to marine systems is agriculture its the same scenario all over the world
4601429 farmers are not doing it on purpose theyd prefer to have it stick on the land
4601430 nitrogen is very slippery its very difficult to keep it on land
4601431 we need to find a technology to keep nitrogen from leaving the soil
4601432 its possible for nue crops to produce the same yield with half as much fertilizer
4601433 its a big economic benefit for farmers if they use only half as much nitrogen as well a big beneficial impact on nitrogen runoff into waterways
4601434 a reasonable expectation is that there would be a dramatic reduction maybe by 2018
4601435 if you look at agricultural ponds you can aerate them to prevent low oxygen
4601436 but thats a pond were talking about open systems with tides the water doesnt just stay there

4601442 our aim is to do our part in helping to reduce carbon emissions
4601443 shipping via ground produces far less emissions versus air and because we have fulfillment centers located on both coasts in napa california and also in albany new york we are able to deliver to 82 of the wine consuming public within 2 days using ground transportation
4601444 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia
4601445 haitian fight song potrebbe anche intitolarsi afro american fight song lassolo che io prendo in questo pezzo pieno di concentrazione non posso suonarlo nel modo giusto se non penso al pregiudizio allodio alla persecuzione e a quanto tutto ci sia iniquo in esso c della tristezza e ci sono delle grida ma c anche della determinazione quando finisco di suonare di solito penso io glielo ho detto spero che mi abbiano ascoltato
4601446 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

4601449 some of the data we have seen has been very encouraging the new york fed data was quite surprising
4601450 the u s data has not been outstanding but it has been positive enough not to stand in the way of those dollar gains
4601451 bond investors believe the worldwide commodity price boom is at an end as the prospects for growth outside the u s start to dim
4601452 if the economy is weakening then bonds are always the place to be and investors are jumping into the bond market with both feet today

4601463 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask

4601465 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4601466 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4601467 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4601468 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee

4601472 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4601473 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4601494 este foi um jogo muito potente tanto individual como colectivamente tivemos algumas dificuldades diante de uma grande equipa como o inter mas estou satisfeito porque o benfica est muito mais competitivo e em crescendo desde o in cio da pr poca
4601495 se o jogo terminasse empatado a eus bio cup deveria ficar na luz mas como quiseram os pen ltis vai para o meu gabinete
4601496 era dif cil ao benfica ganhar este jogo porque defendemos muito bem e at poder amos ter ganho eles tiveram de facto uma bola barra mas n s conseguimos duas ou tr s oportunidades muito boas de fazer funcionar o marcador
4601497 defront mos tr s grandes equipas bayern de munique sevilha e benfica e n o sofremos qualquer golo
4601498 espero que o inter seja de novo campe o j introduzi algumas altera es que ir o melhorar o rendimento da equipa exemplo disso o facto da defesa defender agora bem mais frente os jogadores estavam demasiado preso l atr s assimilaram bem as minhas ideias

4601507 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others
4601508 but chelsea are the most experienced and they might be our biggest threat
4601509 we dont need to get much better to achieve what we did last season but the challenge for us is to improve
4601510 you would think with young players like anderson cristiano ronaldo wayne rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that
4601511 i am expecting a natural progression and there is no doubt in my mind this team will win championships long after i have left
4601512 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times
4601513 he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem
4601514 that is the kind of individual you are dealing with he has that great desire to play anywhere
4601515 there has been no problem with cristiano at all he has slotted straight back in

4601527 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4601528 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4601529 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4601530 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows

4601532 in order to stabilize the situation in georgia we need international observers on the scene fast and eventually we need a more robust and impartial international peacekeeping force that would follow those monitors i count on russian cooperation in getting those monitors in

4601538 not necessarily taking up the articles of impeachment because that would have to be approved on the floor but to have some hearings on the subject

4601551 theyll have too many kids to really pay attention to thats where a lot of problems break out right now i like that the schools are small and theres not too many kids in there

4601606 mccain is as liberal on abortion as obama and has even considered former pennsylvania gov tom ridge who is pro choice as a vice presidential candidate
4601607 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4601608 the challenge will be much greater for mccain because hes not comfortable in those circumstances
4601609 obama has spoken in churches hundreds of times and he feels at home look how many times youve seen mccain give speeches in churches he wont be able to talk about offshore drilling and keeping taxes low those arent those peoples issues they want to talk about poverty and abortion

4601615 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4601616 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4601617 do you think these fellows would come this far and put their reputations and their jobs on the line if they didnt have what they say they have
4601618 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4601619 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4601620 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4601621 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4601622 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4601623 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4601624 for the most part these people have done their time
4601625 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4601626 i think student safety should be a top priority for all schools
4601627 be it resolved that we shall demand actively work for and support reliable fraud free elections by requiring that all voting systems shall provide a paper ballot marked and verified by the voter as the ballot of record

4601634 one way street in which he could not give me information but he could receive information from us
4601635 ultimately the proof of the pudding is in the ballots
4601636 my suggestion would be to re tabulate from the original records this should tell us very quickly whether the gems results were fudged what is the difficulty with this approach
4601637 as for the white wash i would agree with you but the party to the civil law suit that discovered this problem is very much on board they want the data base to be looked at and they have approved the scope of the project the most vocal local naysayers have bought into this process
4601638 regarding your questions the initial issue is about the absentee ballots that were run before the joint summary report the next question is whether after the summary report there was a flip of the fields so the accuracy of the absentee ballots is questioned and the accuracy of the subsequent ballots may be an issue
4601639 shall be used by the secretary of state or attorney general to preclude fraud
4601640 there was gross vote count manipulation that had a great impact on the results of e2006 significantly decreasing the magnitude of what would have been accurately tabulated a democratic landslide of epic proportions
4601641 suspiciously large voter turnout in many elections affecting the outcomes in local and state races
4601642 the time for accountability is now prior to the november election of our next president many counties allegedly destroyed ballots before the election was even certified why would we trust these people with the upcoming elections
4601643 whether we challenge these offenses in court or run for public office we must replace those who would show such contempt for the law

4601660 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4601661 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4601662 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4601663 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4601664 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4601665 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4601666 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4601667 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4601668 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4601669 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4601670 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4601671 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4601672 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4601673 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4601674 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4601675 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4601676 news feed when there are not 5 or more you may remove the 5
4601677 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4601678 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4601679 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4601680 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4601681 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4601682 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4601683 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4601684 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4601685 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4601686 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4601687 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4601688 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4601689 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4601690 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4601696 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
4601697 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
4601698 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4601699 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4601700 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4601701 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4601716 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
4601717 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
4601718 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once

4601737 the creative staff at frozen codebase has really showcased the versatility of vicious engine through zombie wranglers and fresco beach

4601764 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4601765 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4601766 things just didnt work out thats all i can tell you
4601767 were all happy we were able to figure this out within the first four months instead of dragging it out over four years
4601768 now its all over and we can all move on i sincerely wish daniel nothing but the best in life and i hope he feels the same toward the district
4601769 i love this community and my family does too so we hope to stay in the community for a long time
4601770 my two children start school in indian prairie unit district 204 in just over a week and were excited about that
4601771 this is a situation where daniel and the board realized that they did not see eye to eye on the basic direction of the park district and how it should be managed there is no one event that caused this realization but rather a series of things over the past few months
4601772 betts recognized that the board had the right to an executive director with whom it saw eye to eye the board recognized the fact that daniel had relocated his wife and two young children to naperville from denver and that once he left the park district finding another comparable job would likely be difficult
4601773 that woman is incredible but its not fair to her
4601774 id really like to see someone come in and give that woman a break if we had two mindys that would be great
4601775 as much as naperville likes to make fun of the park district we are still one of the most outstanding districts out there

4601782 so bin laden set about spinning the revelations contained in the quran and the sayings of the prophet muhammad known as the hadith which provide much of the context for actual religious practice in the muslim world
4601783 the new islam the children of muslim immigrants who came to america in the 60s are coming of age both pious and modern they are the future of the faith
4601784 online and on campus in suburban mosques and summer camps young american muslims are challenging their neighbors perceptions of islam as a foreign faith and of muslims as fiery fundamentalists or bomb lobbing terrorists
4601785 that image problem may be this generations biggest challenge in the new world
4601786 two muslim women at barack obama s rally in detroit on monday were barred from sitting behind the podium by campaign volunteers seeking to prevent the womens headscarves from appearing in photographs or on television with the candidate
4601787 i was coming to support him and i felt like i was discriminated against by the very person who was supposed to be bringing this change who i could really relate to the message that i thought was delivered to us was that they do not want him associated with muslims or muslim supporters
4601788 abuse of detainees has never been is not and wil ever be the policy of this government
4601789 torture is illegal every enhanced technique that has been used by the cia was brought to the department of justice and they made a determination that its use under specific circumstances and with safeguards was lawful
4601790 we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place but we all want to move in the same direction towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren
4601791 what you wont hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge
4601792 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans for example have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging they have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly they need specific reassurances that their citizenship really means something that america has learned the right lessons from the japanese internments during world war ii and that i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
4601793 weve had numerous incidents with major events and concerts taking place here where ticket brokers have purchased up the tickets and local folks cant get to them they have to go to brokers to get them
4601794 so i think hopefully this will level the market a little bit for folks in denver trying to buy tickets
4601795 you can go online and buy tickets now from the brokers and thats why brokers are snapping up these tickets when they go on sale in denver

4601800 the armies and raiding parties sent by the messenger of allah between the time he came to medina and his death ten years was forty eight
4601801 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
4601802 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
4601803 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
4601804 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
4601805 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
4601806 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other

4601823 although most of our riders are under contract until december 31 2008 and we are not obligated to release them prior to this date we have decided that even though we think we will have a new sponsor signed by the end of november for continental team status in 2009 we do not want to put the riders in a position of not being able to obtain employment in the event our sponsorship contract is not ultimately signed leaving the riders in a bad spot
4601824 its truly a pity that we were not able to get a contract signed in time to keep our family together going forward even though we have a couple of sponsors who can potentially sign in the coming months
4601825 in any other industry this rule would qualify as age discrimination but not in the world of cycling where a team cannot race without a uci approved team license governed exclusively by uci rules and issued by each countries home cycling federation who are required to enforce such rules today i was forced to tell my riders that although i have money burning a hole in my pocket to support the team and we have contractual commitments from many of our current sponsors for 2009 we cannot give them a job because they are either too old or we dont have enough time to sign our new sponsor by the imposed uci deadline to become either a continental or pro continental team in 2009
4601826 if our team continues we will certainly have some significant changes due to the new uci rules we are looking forward to securing a new partner for the 2009 season by the end of november who can benefit from and build their brand by being associated with our world class organization we are confident another sponsor will capitalize on the value united pro cycling team generates with our 25 000 registered fans eight figure annual measurable media exposure 3 3 million annual onsite spectators and the charitable work our team does in the communities we race in

4601866 i mean youre pale and your hair is dull and lifeless but im guessing you always look like that
4601867 as i can tell from your silly little scrunched up face and crossed eyes you are obviously trying to fathom why im here
4601868 im going to cut to the chase abigail jake told me to stop by and make sure you were alright but i have a few things id like to get straight with you
4601869 jake mcintyres wide eyed secretary doting on him making his calls and hiding his dirty little secrets and now every fly in his web has had that first little movement that captured his attention hes good looking powerful cocky with balls to back it up there are lots of girls like you i bet you dont know that hell his wife is like you so obedient never asking questions though between you and me she knows everything the funny thing is shes not even on his radar so the question little girl is what you did to you so to make the big guy take note
4601870 the mousy girl who writes down all sorts of shocking little secrets in her little book i can imagine what happened knowing jake he saw it and he told you to bring it to him you fought it and beat yourself up and eventually you did
4601871 youre wrong i didnt fight it i gave it to him right then and there
4601872 poor thing do you think of jake being the one
4601873 you are completely unaware arent you you are just getting his coffee and keeping a schedule of his rendezvous and writing in your little diary all the dirty things you think about
4601874 you dont even know that men would fall over for you if you just dressed yourself up look at those lips big pouting bee stung lips those eyes huge and innocent not to mention that bottom
4601875 you think jake wouldnt fuck you he would he will youre just not ready yet hes not for beginners jakes a bad boy he can trample a woman i see the boys in your office they fuck the nineteen year old cigarette girls and the coat check girls and the doe eyed junior secretaries jake likes women he likes someone who can take roughness and isnt going to break
4601876 no he spanks me he slaps me he never hits me
4601877 no i suppose he wouldnt he has a lot of rules in that head of his anyhow i dont want to know if i dont read it then i can just think the worst the dirtiest
4601878 well mister jacob mcintyre asked me to stop by and wanted me to give you the message that he is sorry you are feeling under the weather and he hopes that his assignment yesterday wasnt too difficult and he hopes it wasnt that which led to your absence
4601879 he said that when you come back tomorrow everything can go back to the way it was but if you return with what he requested he may have additional responsibilities for you
4601880 i think because of my relationship with your employer and the fact that we hardly know each other you should probably answer me in a way that your bosss clients and friends are used to being addressed
4601881 well i suppose i will be seeing you abigail or not
4601882 youre a pretty girl abigail its too bad you dont have much luck with love

4601891 when you cut a program you have to rebuild it some other way creating new programs takes months and months
4601892 its appalling that these cuts come during the olympics when all eyes are focused on the world stage
4601893 you cant compete without investment in years of training and long term support the arts are no different
4601894 gravely concerned by these recent decisions and will be seeking meetings with both heritage and foreign affairs ministers to encourage their reconsideration given the size of our market and the current state of our industry now is the time to strengthen not abolish such key programs
4601895 canadians depend on our artists and their work to communicate canadian values government investment is a crucial element of cultural diplomacy in every developed nation including canada
4601896 whats being considered is to examine how we can create a new program or new avenues that will be more efficient and with a stronger impact for our culture abroad

4601913 that era to my understanding and certainly among my clients is over
4601914 they are coming after these guys for tons of money over record keeping violations
4601915 these are small employers they are not sophisticated people they are trying to start a business and create jobs for people
4601916 there are whole industries in new york in which violations are the norm and labor law compliance is unusual
4601917 what we want to do is change the culture with our enforcement efforts change the culture so that compliance becomes the norm

4601924 you can get practically any idea accepted if doctors are in favour

4602094 indias performance in chartering a plane to take the players back home in the event of an independent judge finding against them in the harbhajan singh case counted amongst the most nakedly aggressive actions taken in the history of a notoriously fractious game
4602095 it is high time the elders of the game in that proud country stopped playing to the gallery and considered the games wider interests india is not some tinpot dictatorship but an international powerhouse and ought to think and act accordingly

4602097 over the years india have often been represented by gentlemen with high principles and a strong sense of sportsmanship australia have not been so fortunate but it seems that power has corrupted
4602098 it was not an implied threat to the justice system it was a direct challenge to it india took part in the creation of the legal framework they disregarded if the indians had packed their bags australia should have refused to appear in india next season
4602099 indias conduct was deplorable that the australians have been carrying on like pork chops for years was no excuse india had every right to stand against them but not to undermine the rule of law posturing has cost them the high ground

4602102 once the microphones and umpires could not back up the charges the case was doomed that does not make harbhajan a hero it is high time his seniors took him in hand he has become a hothead with an unpleasant tongue

4602131 at this weeks annual station meeting one of the participants stood up and commented on how the board and npr sr management seemed to lack joy i think its time we all reconnected with that source of enthusiasm and creativity again
4602132 its been my experience that few listeners understand our love hate owner servant links to the member stations or why the move away from local stations has put so much strain on that relationship also and i dont think im exaggerating much here i still get asked about what happened to bob edwards on an all but weekly basis

4602148 we remain bullish on gold with a 2009 price forecast of us 950 oz driven by a return of fabrication demand after the price correction wealth effects in developing nations and negative real interest rates
4602149 the underlying driver of commodity intensive infrastructure investment in developing countries remains unchanged short term risks remain but the opportunities are there for investors corporates that can look through the haze of negativity
4602150 the super cycle bull market for commodity stocks that has been underway since early this decade has not been a one way street with a number of meaningful corrections that have tested the resolve of the market
4602151 trading these spikes and troughs in the mining stocks is not without risks but is undeniably a highly rewarding strategy for those that are nimble enough and have the courage to look through the current negative haze surrounding the sector
4602152 the only reason for not stepping up and buying the sector after this recent correction is a belief that the cycle is not well and truly over and commodity prices will fall further
4602153 this point is critical as china is after all the key driver of the commodity super cycle

4602173 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4602174 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4602175 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4602177 this receiver is not good at receiving weak signals receiver noise and intermodulation tends to obscure the weak incoming signal also it is vulnerable to the nearby computer noise image interference is quite obvious in this single superhet many broadcasting station can be heard in the 28 30mhz portion of the dial but they are the 2nd harmonics of 15mhz band broadcasting for international broadcasting with at least moderate signal strength however it admirably plays the sound from 16cm speaker is quite smooth and rich especially the full bodied bass clear high tone may be also enjoyed with treble control up if theres no adjacent interference now i find the rf 1150 being one of the best receiver for my purpose relax and enjoy the cozy listening of my favorite shortwave programs

4602182 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds 3 because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance 4 perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything 5 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him 6 but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind 7 that man should not think he will receive anything from the lord 8 he is a double minded man unstable in all he does

4602190 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4602191 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4602192 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4602193 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4602194 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos

4602217 the studio team is willing to take creative risks invest in quality and do what it takes to create iconic innovative shows
4602218 it stems from the support that anne and bob gave us
4602219 its symbiotic between the network and the studio steve and i both want to win steve and his team offer a lot of things creatively and they offer an unbelievable marketing machine thats been a game changer in the network business over the last few years and kudos to them for what theyve done
4602220 and i think its been recognized in the community that if we do get on the air someplace else our partners will be satisfied by the quality of the production that we bring to the table

4602224 she has the ability to write a show that appears old fashioned and earnest without a lick of irony but if you listen carefully the show is filled with dialogue thats hip and crisp as if youre listening to a real cell phone conversation between two teenagers
4602225 i like all of our actors and the younger ones in particular have opinions
4602226 theyll come to me and tell me if some of their dialogue doesnt sound right to them
4602227 wrapped themselves in the vestments of irony and comedy to sidestep the difficult issue of an unwanted pregnancy
4602228 id rather get good ratings and bad reviews than bad ratings and good reviews

4602238 you start with the muezzeins call to prayer followed by a shot of men praying in a mosque followed by explosions in iraq then a shot of shiites flagellating themselves in the street during the festival of ashura you end the sequence with a crowd burning an american flag
4602239 ive seen those shots too but let me describe how turkish tv views america
4602240 no but i can guess you start off with a long shot up 5th avenue in new york when the crowds are thickest then you go to a shot of the chicago grain exchange with floor traders going berserk screaming and selling shares then theres a shot of the statue of liberty followed by a night shot of vegas you finish with a shot of scantily clad women roller blading along a sidewalk in venice beach california of course you have to show an american fighter jet dropping bombs or staffing civilians in vietnam

4602352 i often look back and realize what it did for me
4602353 i really appreciated my years here and theres too many teachers to sit here and name and count but so many of them definitely put an extra effort to make sure kids succeed here
4602354 they were actually my favorite team growing up and i looked up to wayne gretzky as a little kid playing there would be a dream come true
4602355 youre going to see more and more players year after year
4602356 many of the kids played at the grassroots of hockey in small towns
4602357 i looked up to them as a kid so i think junior a hockey is getting a better profile the past few years and i think thats wonderful there are so many teams in this great country
4602358 on occasion we have left one of the kids waiting someplace thinking somebody else was going to pick them up

4602372 but i got the chance in practice all the time and i had a decent amount of success in the american hockey league
4602373 things are going pretty well for me in the games that ive played i really cant complain
4602374 it was up to them im happy it worked out the way it did yes going to a contender with a chance to win the cup was an exciting possibility but when i signed here two years ago it was to help this team to improve and make the playoffs i just wanted them to do whatever they felt was right it hasnt quite worked out the way i wanted it to work when i signed here but theres a lot of young talent here a lot of young skilled players and weve just got to get some pieces in around them to help them improve
4602375 the young guys here just have to make the next step
4602376 guys like alexander frolov anze kopitar jack johnson and mike cammalleri these are the guys who get the minutes and they just need to take it to the next step with the right people around them

4602466 zionisme dulu adalah sebuah pengkhianatan atas tanah air mereka yahudi dan sinagog para rabbi
4602467 zionisme ingin menamai orang orang yahudi sebagai sebuah lembaga nasional
4602468 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkan kitab taurat di dalamnya ada petunjuk dan cahaya yang menerangi
4602469 pemerintahan yang mulia memandang pentingnya pendirian di palestina sebuah tanah air nasional bagi orang orang yahudi di palestina
4602470 kita harus membunuh semua orang orang palestina kecuali mereka tunduk tinggal di sini sebagai budak
4602471 sesungguhnya aku tidak menyia nyiakan amal orang orang yang beramal di antara kamu baik laki laki atau perempuan karena sebagian kamu adalah turunan dari sebagian yang lain259 maka orang orang yang berhijrah yang diusir dari kampung halamannya yang disakiti pada jalan ku yang berperang dan yang dibunuh pastilah akan ku hapuskan kesalahan kesalahan mereka dan pastilah aku masukkan mereka ke dalam surga yang mengalir sungai sungai di bawahnya sebagai pahala di sisi allah dan allah pada sisi nya pahala yang baik

4602474 the origins and evolution of the palestine problem 1917 1988
4602475 theyre now transmitted laterally and collaboratively via the internet you once had a series of gatekeepers in the adoption of a trend the innovator the early adopter the late adopter the early mainstream the late mainstream and finally the conservative but now it goes straight from the innovator to the mainstream
4602476 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4602477 obstructions and incidents that militated against realisation of full potential of the country in terms of crude oil production
4602478 maintained at an average of two million barrels per day
4602479 it was very disturbing a few weeks ago when for the first time nigerias daily oil production dropped to below 1 8 million barrels per day

4602490 i did make a request actually when that incident happened on that particular day
4602491 i asked his that it should be handled if it can be sorted out whatever the issues but it went up to the match referee and there was a case his response was it had already been reported having played cricket for this long i knew such an allegation would definitely spiral into what it has now i anticipated that
4602492 and i envisaged that it would blow up into a larger issue so that was the only reason there was a hearing and now weve made an appeal im sure things will be sorted out now
4602493 it is important that ricky and i get together and speak about it and then get together and address it
4602494 it was not that the spirit of the game was attacked but the focus has been to ensure that better spirit prevails in the game we are all equal partners in ensuring that cricket is played in the right spirit and im sure moving forward everybody will stick to that on behalf of my team im sure well play it in the right spirit
4602495 i have no problems whats the problem there it was just a temporary setback we need to move on the game is bigger than the individual as a nation weve played good cricket im proud of the way indian cricket teams have played over the years and well continue to do that the relationship between india and australia has always been good
4602496 it was only meant for the sydney game ive respected australian cricketers i have great respect and regard for all the players who have played for australia it was just one of those incidents which everybody has seen and if people think i had a biased opinion there has been a poll and people who have seen the game have also said it could have been better
4602497 we enter our period of time before our convention in a very strong position
4602498 every public survey we have seen indicates that we have effectively consolidated the base around john mccain we have a higher intensity of support around our republican base than the democrats have around theirs
4602499 young people throughout the primaries and caucuses were overwhelmingly on obamas side over hillary clinton and the other democratic candidates
4602500 and in the polls so far in the general election there is a huge age gap with younger people backing obama by double digits and older people people over 50 and people over 65 for sure supporting senator mccain
4602501 it probably makes them as serious and as bad as theyve been since the cold war ended since the early mikhail gorbachev days
4602502 now that kind of engagement that kind of strategic dialogue becomes far more difficult because political sentiment in the united states and in europe has again seen russia as a fundamental problem even potentially a threat and an adversary and needs to be treated as such
4602503 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest
4602504 and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4602505 we need russia in a number of different areas in balkan policy in our relations with iran and trying to prevent the development of nuclear power in iran
4602506 so we dont want to jeopardize that relationship and yet by encouraging georgia particularly by promoting georgias entry into nato we have seriously antagonized the russians and now we dont have that many cards to play basically the ball is in russias court
4602507 in order to stabilize the situation in georgia we need international observers on the scene fast and eventually we need a more robust and impartial international peacekeeping force that would follow those monitors i count on russian cooperation in getting those monitors in
4602508 never georgia will succumb to their pressures never ever we will surrender never ever we will give up our freedom and independence never ever we will give any piece of our territory and freedom will go to every part of georgia to every ethnic group to every community in georgia and we will definitely get rid of this invaders for good i am totally convinced of that one
4602509 we came from the black sea to reach our airplane in armenia
4602510 i dont want to die here and stay i cant
4602511 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4602512 this is one more example of the national democratic party embracing policies that threaten the stability of families
4602513 voters should remember this donation advocating for homosexuals to marry in california when democratic candidates attempt to woo evangelicals with talk of faith and values this donation does not line up with biblical truth
4602514 christian groups have the same first amendment rights as anyone else
4602515 the only wall that separates religious groups from public meeting rooms is the wall built by government officials who fail to understand the constitution
4602516 i was very nervous and i needed something to calm me down and i listen to the harry potter books because your mind goes off to a magical world and its great because i was able to keep my nerves in control
4602517 were hard wired physiologically and preconsciously to recoil from threats like photographs of skin cancer or blackened lungs but humor acts like a trojan horse getting the threat past that initial response so we can assess it and protect ourselves
4602518 a lot of humor is based on truth so its an easier way to connect than getting overly serious or dramatic about a product
4602519 i am a layman thankful to his church anchored by his faith and his humble background
4602520 im virtually convinced that when fernando lugo finishes his term he will return to religious life
4602521 i have no need of this money which belongs to more humble people

4602523 the talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4602524 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4602525 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4602526 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4602527 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4602528 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4602529 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe
4602530 this is too good of an opportunity to pass up

4602559 exchange of ideas and robust debate on matters of public concern
4602560 the current government likes to play the part of the all powerful provider if you take tax of the workers and hand it around you might make more enemies than friends you may bribe students increase the number of people on welfare and instead of simply cutting taxes for nine years hand out billions in badly designed packages such as working for families
4602561 returning new zealands living standards to the top half of the oecd is up to us we can achieve this by working both harder and smarter its time we stopped looking to the government with outstretched hands and got on with the job ourselves

4602566 how incalculable have been the negative results of ill directed criticism in the catastrophic divergences it has created in religion in the equally contentious factions it has spawned in political systems which have dignified conflict by institutionalizing such concepts as the
4602567 the aggressiveness and competitiveness which animate a dominantly capitalist culture the partisanship inherent in a fervidly democratic system the suspicion of public policy institutions and the skepticism towards established authority ingrained in the political attitude of the people and which trace their origins to the genesis of american society the cynical disregard of the moderating principles and rules of civilized human relationships resulting from an excessive liberalism and its immoral consequences such unsavory characteristics inform entrenched habits of american life

4602673 hay un resurgimiento de los movimientos ind genas y campesinos
4602674 en las estructuras eclesi sticas desde el vaticano hasta las conferencias episcopales es una opci n menos expl cita menos clara sigue existiendo en los movimientos populares en las comunidades cristianas de base pastores curas y evang licos
4602675 es una tendencia terrible hay racismo y una fuerte discriminaci n de las personas a partir de una clase social que es producida fabricada y que aplica esa marginalidad esa miseria humana en las periferias hay una guerra social hay una lucha muy injusta
4602676 estas clases sociales oprimidas explotadas en una sociedad en la que muchas veces infelizmente la iglesia esquiva

4602684 we need meaningful action on this issue from washington but it looks like mr tonko is in the corner of house speaker nancy pelosi who is blocking a simple vote on domestic drilling in favor of a five week vacation
4602685 parang ayoko nang pumunta sa graduation nila bahala na sila

4602687 weve seen little of her life and less of her death
4602688 they village officials supposedly want to clean up the borders
4602689 no hay necesidad de apagar la luz del pr jimo para que la nuestra brille
4602690 and now i will show you the most excellent way
4602691 who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god but made himself nothing he humbled himself
4602692 for god is not a god of disorder but of peace
4602693 under his control all the different parts of the body fit together and the whole body is held together by every joint with which it is provided so when each separate part works as it should the whole body grows and builds itself up through the love
4602694 but where there are prophecies they will cease where there are tongues they will be stilled where there is knowledge it will pass away
4602695 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
4602696 when i was a child i spoke and thought and reasoned as a child
4602697 now we see things imperfectly as in a cloudy mirror but then we will see everything with perfect clarity all that i know now is partial and incomplete but then i will know everything completely just as god now knows me completely
4602698 now i know in part then i shall know fully even as i am fully known
4602699 but to all who believed him and accepted him he gave the right to become children of god they are reborn not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan but a birth that comes from god
4602700 dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit lives in you if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy him for gods temple is sacred and you are that temple
4602701 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control
4602702 now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good
4602703 the baptism of the spirit refers to the placing of members into the body at the moment of their conversion
4602704 the jews were first baptized into the body at pentecost acts 1 5 and acts 2 the gentiles were first baptized into the body at the household of cornelius the centurion acts 10 44 and 11 15 16 and ever since whenever a sinner trusts jesus he is made a part of that same body by the operation of the holy spirit
4602705 if the whole body were an eye where would the sense of hearing be if the whole body were an ear where would the sense of smell be
4602706 in fact some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary
4602707 jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
4602708 for when we place our faith in christ jesus there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised what is important is faith expressing itself in love
4602709 if one part suffers all the part suffers with it and if one part is honored all the parts are glad
4602710 you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ
4602711 and so dear brothers and sisters i plead with you to give your bodies to god because of all he has done for you let them be a living and holy sacrifice the kind he will find acceptable this is truly the way to worship him dont copy the behavior and customs of this world but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know gods will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect
4602712 for where two or three come together in my name there i am with them
4602713 dont be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles expensive jewelry or beautiful clothes you should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is so precious to god this is how the holy women of old made themselves beautiful they trusted god and accepted the authority of their husbands
4602714 for man did not come from woman but woman from man neither was man created for woman but woman for man
4602715 but among the lords people women are not independent of men and men are not independent of women for although the first woman came from man every other man was born from a woman and everything comes from god
4602716 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse
4602717 how much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the son of god under foot who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him and who has insulted the spirit of grace
4602718 a man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup
4602719 so then my brothers when you come together to eat wait for each other
4602720 if anyone is hungry he should eat at home so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment
4602721 if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him
4602722 and remember when you are being tempted do not say god is tempting me god is never tempted to do wrong and he never tempts anyone else
4602723 follow the way of love and eagerly desire aspire eagerly after spiritual gifts especially the gift of prophecy
4602724 everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening encouragement and comfort
4602725 if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels
4602726 then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language
4602727 utterly amazed they asked are not all these men who are speaking galileans
4602728 through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people but even then they will not listen to me says the lord
4602729 anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says
4602730 for god is not a god of disorder but of peace
4602731 the gift of proclaiming gods message should be under the speakers control because god does not want us to be in disorder but in harmony and peace
4602732 your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you
4602733 speaks of the womans instinctive inclination or passionate desire towards her husband of which he takes advantage so as to dominate her
4602734 as in all the churches of gods people the women should keep quiet in the meetings
4602735 by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word i preached to you
4602736 and i have the same hope in god as these men that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked
4602737 do not be amazed at this for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned
4602738 after his suffering he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive he appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of god
4602739 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
4602740 but whatever i am now it is all because god poured out his special favor on me and not without results for i have worked harder than any of the other apostles yet it was not i but god who was working through me by his grace
4602741 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace to me was without effect no i worked harder than all of them yet not i but the grace of god that was with me
4602742 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies and whoever lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this
4602743 performed or suffered by one person as a substitute for another or to the benefit or advantage of another
4602744 how are the dead raised with what kind of body will they come
4602745 but god gives it a body as he has determined and to each kind of seed he gives its own body
4602746 we will not all sleep but we will all be changed in a flash in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet
4602747 for our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies
4602748 i asked the campaign this journamalism sic thing actually works sometimes

4602827 the resolution calls attention to the intolerable dilemma that torture presents when those who are supposed to be the healers in our society are involved in the abuse of prisoners
4602828 as professional licensure and codes of ethics are regulated by states california has the obligation to notify members of laws concerning torture that may result in their prosecution
4602829 this is an important advance not just in the u s but internationally as well
4602830 more doctors abet torture than treat its victims and it is time for them to be called to the mission of medicine not to practice torture and to be reminded that they will be held accountable to international law

4602864 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4602920 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4602921 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4602928 saat ini masalah itukan masih ditangani oleh komisi a jadi mengapa harus menggunakan hak angket
4602929 belum saatnya hak angket dilakukan itukan masih tugasnya komisi a lain halnya kalau komisi a menemukan jalan buntu baru kemudian bisa direkomendasikan ke pimpinan dewan untuk segera di paripurnakan saat itulah akan dilakukan penggalangan penggunaan hak angket
4602930 hak angket memang perlu tapi sebaiknya pemkab segera mengklarisifikasi dahulu soal pemutasian guru itu kalau memang harus ditindaklanjuti dengan penggunaan hak angket saya siap mendukungnya
4602931 karena tidak ada alasan lagi bagi dprd untuk tidak menggunakan hak angket melihat tidak adanya tanggungjawab pemkab menangani masalah itu baik secara administrasi maupun secara hukum

4602934 these are the budgets for the year but they are estimates because we have this new cut to absorb
4602935 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4602936 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4602937 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4602938 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4602939 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4602940 you can go anywhere in the world and people will say canton
4602941 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4602942 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4602943 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4602944 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4602945 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4602946 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4602947 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4602948 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4602949 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4602950 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4602951 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4602952 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4602953 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4602954 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner
4602955 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4602956 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4602957 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4602958 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4602959 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4602960 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4602961 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog
4602962 we all have our ups and we all have our downs and when youre up you reach out and when youre down you allow others to help
4602963 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
4602964 i think sometimes as a teacher i forget that it is my responsibility to help students to create meaning
4602965 friends are like stars you cant always see them but you know theyre there
4602966 the knee is fine and i am happy with this return to football
4602967 at first i was a bit anxious but a little fear is normal and my confidence grew after the first 10 or 20 seconds
4602968 at the moment i can feel a few small pains but i have been missing tackles and pressure from opponents
4602969 but things are getting better like this if i continue on this level then i will definitely be back for the italian super cup on august 24
4602970 i have heard talk about this for a month in the newspapers but the negotiations took ages
4602971 jose mourinho has shown that he is a great coach but i just hope he doesnt do well for inter this year
4602972 the scudetto race wont just be a question of two teams this year because juventus milan and fiorentina are also in contention
4602973 i see its out of stock online and not available in stores how can i get it
4602974 if its out of stock why dont you get more
4602975 yes place the money in the cd tray of your computer close it if you re open it and the moeny is gone then we have accepted your payment
4602976 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner
4602977 j tais tr s fatigu davoir jou tellement de matches et javais mal l paule mais jai jou de mieux en mieux
4602978 were at the phase right now where its time to start moving back into classrooms into the gymnasiums and into the storage areas this is the point where we need volunteers today we scheduled a four hour work session from eight to noon last i check we were in the fifties as far as the number of people who showed up
4602979 some people heard it on the radio this morning or on the news i didnt even know it was going to be on there and people stopped by ive never even met before with no affiliation but decided they wanted to help
4602980 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4602981 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4602982 i came through so many battles and so many injuries standing next to the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4602983 first 1 the concept of covenantal nomism is used to highlight the irreducible particularity of pauls polemic against works of the law rather than to promote a view of judaism as a religion of grace second 2 it is argued that divine agency plays a more direct and immediate role in pauline pattern of religion than in the judaism paul opposes third 3 the phrase works of the law is here understood to refer to the distinctive way of life of the jewish community but without any special orientation towards boundary markers such as circumcision food laws or sabbath fourth 4 paul is said to advocate a sectarian separation between the christian community and judaism rather than an inclusive understanding of the one people of god as encompassing uncircumcised gentiles these emphases were all central to the first edition of this book and i now propose that they point us beyond the new perspective
4602984 i have used the part of social identity theory which describes how groups maintain a sense of identity for their members by strengthening the boundaries separating them from outgroups to explain the situation in galatia and pauls response to it
4602985 this is the main reason why francis watsons significant attempt at a social explanation of romans may be ultimately unsuccessful he utilizes the model of transition from reform movement to sect which works well on galatians with respect to romans a text to which it is not well suited the major problem with watsons view is whether his insistence that paul is seeking to persuade his judean readers to drop their judean identity can be correlated with the data in romans where paul seeks to establish an overarching common identity that embraces judean and greek subgroup indentities without extinguishing either
4602986 led to problems because the leaders did not foresee the problem of what happens when uncircumcised and circumcised believers engage in table fellowship
4602987 the lutheran insistence on the centrality and radicality of divine grace is not wholly in error the claim that judaism is a religion of grace will prove to be at least as misleading as the older language of legalism or works righteousness while there should be no reversion to the lutheran paul of the old perspective one does not read paul aright merely by criticizing luther and emphasizing gentile inclusion
4602988 agree with sanders that paul moved from solution to plight discovering first in the death and resurrection of christ the sole reality of salvation especially from the pervasive sinfulness of the present evil age gal 1 4 even though he himself had not been sinful philip 3 6 and then developing the implications of this for his gentiles
4602989 i just wanted to step on it the first 50 a little bit and try to get out to an early lead
4602990 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4602991 if phelps wasnt in this sport i dont think i would be as good just because hes up there and i just want to become better than him
4602992 he pushes me in practice in everything i can say that without him i wouldnt be where i am right now
4602993 it was my first individual olympic gold medal i touched the wall and i was just like thank you finally i felt really good the whole way
4602994 for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and just having us miss going 1 2 its a pretty incredible swim its a pretty incredible day for him im glad to see him get his first gold its a cool moment i know hes happy
4602995 ryan swum a wonderful race and i swum the best race i could possibly swim im proud of what i did but he swam a beautiful race and im proud of him
4602996 it just happened and it felt great i just tried to stay relaxed and not rush through the water just keep my strokes strong and power through them
4602997 you are welcome to come and spend some money in my shop
4602998 this is no time to give a kid with barely a learners permit the keys to the car
4602999 i mean its a waste of energy to have a 10 000 sq ft house with an acre of grassy lawn

4603093 scheunemann prepped his boss for an april 17 phone call with the president of georgia and then helped the presumptive republican presidential nominee prepare a strong statement of support for the fledgling republic
4603094 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4603095 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4603096 e thics experts have raised concerns about former lobbyists for foreign governments providing advice to presidential candidates about those same countries
4603097 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
4603098 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4603099 as a private lobbyist trying to influence lawmakers and bush administration staffers scheunemann at times relied on his access to mccain in his work for foreign clients on capitol hill he and his partner reported 71 phone conversations and meetings with mccain and his top advisers since 2004 on behalf of foreign clients including georgia according to forms they filed with the justice department
4603100 the contacts often focused on georgias aspirations to join nato and on legislative proposals including a measure co sponsored by mccain that supported georgias position on south ossetia one of the georgian regions taken over by russia this weekend

4603127 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4603128 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4603129 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4603130 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4603131 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4603132 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4603141 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4603142 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4603143 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4603144 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4603145 sri lankas sinhala language newspaper the divaina said prime minister ratnasiri wickramanayaka invited to his office the inventor who claimed that a miracle hydrogen generator making use of water he made is capable of running an internal combustion engine replacing gasoline the newspaper published a photograph that showed the young inventor thushara edirisinghe showing the new apparatus that he claimed having the capability of producing hydrogen from water that could be installed into a car to convert the vehicle from a gasoline run car to a water run car earlier newspaper reports said how the inventor ran cars with water after borrowing cars from others since he did not have his own car to convert and test drive the reports said how the owners always wanted him to return their vehicles thushara edirisinghe reportedly told the prime minister that his converter could run a car for 80 kilometers 49 7 miles from one liter of water 4 liters is 1 056 gallons so using his method would let you drive almost 200 miles per gallon of water jwd if thushara edirisinghes invention is true that could also provide a solution for another problem the global warming created by burning fossil fuels like petroleum which are hydrocarbons made from ancient animals died in a catastrophe

4603149 the time is now to do something about our environment while we still can
4603150 we need a clean source of energy and this is certainly a way of going about it
4603151 a manufacturer of direct drive generators that convert the mechanical energy produced by wind turbines into electrical energy ocycle technologies inc also designs power electronics converters that transform electricity into energy adapted to everyday needs the firms invention is based on the innovative adaptation of a transverse flux configuration and the use of permanent magnets in the generator assembly this patented technologys very high low speed torque eliminates the need for a gearbox on the wind turbine the transverse flux permanent magnet tfpm generator developed by ocycle technologies inc is lightweight maintenance free and stands up to even the most extreme climates historically wind turbines have relied on an assembly composed of a gearbox and a high speed induction generator to convert the mechanical energy from the low speed wind turbine rotor into electrical energy the gearbox is constantly under high stress and its failure is often at the origin of wind turbine breakdown ocycles answer to the gearbox problem is the combination of a high torque permanent magnet and a power electronics converter its line of generators uses an innovative adaptation of a transverse flux configuration a specially designed power electronics converter is matched to the generator to benefit from the superior efficiency of variable speed wind turbines
4603152 based on patterns of associations between building related symptoms and certain volatile organic compounds indoors we hypothesized that increasing levels of outdoor ozone would lead to higher prevalence of building related symptoms among the occupants within a building
4603153 the study estimated that removing both risk factors higher ozone in outdoor air and polyester synthetic filters could reduce brs by 26 to 62 percent
4603154 this research is a first step and it needs to be replicated in other studies with a statistical design specifically to address the ozone symptom association and with accurate information on filters and ozone levels the strongest studies would involve controlled interventions on these two factors
4603155 however if future research confirms these results then we may have a path toward reducing building related symptoms as well as illness caused by chronic exposure to ozone in the indoor environment through the use of ozone removal technologies in ventilation systems

4603158 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
4603159 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
4603160 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
4603161 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
4603162 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
4603163 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
4603164 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy
4603165 the project is under progress we do not yet have any timeframe for launch

4603172 we cannot tolerate the democratic process in which a terrorist muslim probably born in indonesia or africa or somewhere whose real name is obviously barry soretos and doesnt even qualify to run for president under the constitution slayed our goddess hrc in the primaries and expects to get away with it were not angry or resentful even though we didnt get our way and were not unduly obsessed as our detractors claim

4603180 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4603181 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4603182 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4603183 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4603184 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4603185 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4603186 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4603187 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4603188 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4603361 all mike schattenkerk needs to increase a cars gas mileage is simple chemistry and electrodes distilled water a sturdy container and some wiring to deliver it the device itself is basic enough inside a hard plastic one quart container filled with distilled water schattenkerk inserts two steel electrodes wiring connects the electrodes to a ground on the cars frame and a positive charge within the fuse box which activates only when the ignition is turned on the positively charged electrode sends water molecules into a frenzy the electrolysis separates hydrogen and oxygen from each other in a vacuum and they return to gas which is then sucked into the fuel mixture via plastic tubing and the engines intake manifold the hydrogen works as a fuel additive schattenkerk says when it is burned both the hydrogen and the oxygen return to water however water production is minimal no more than what the engine may produce on a humid day and stainless steel valves are not necessary he added a pinch of baking soda works as a catalyst for the electrolysis but too much can blow a fuse when schattenkerk first hooked the hydrogen generator to his wifes 1998 saturn the mid size car improved its mileage from 28 miles per gallon to 35 as for maintenance he said the device should be checked once about every 1 000 miles and water added as needed its important that its distilled water since regular tap water holds minerals and other impurities that can cause corrosion when the water turns brick red schattenkerk says its time to rinse out the container and add new water

4603376 one of the worst political books ever written corsi piles distortion upon innuendo to create a gigantic heap of right wing garbage with a seemingly endless parade of basic factual errors running through the text like rats corsis book is an embarrassment to the craft of journalism and any of the conservatives who have praised and promoted it should feel humiliated at how bad it truly is

4603378 unlike most of the critics of the obama nation i have actually read the book from cover to cover it is a thoroughly well documented piece of first rate journalism are there mistakes in it show me a first edition that doesnt have some other than the bible but is it truthful does it add considerably to the publics knowledge of the front running candidate for the presidency do we know much more about obama than we would had we relied exclusively for our information from the new york times the los angeles times the washington post and the associated press i offer a resounding yes to all three of those questions i am privileged to call him my friend colleague and co worker i stand with jerry corsi today as he is viciously maligned by an attack media that would prefer to aim its potent artillery at a man who dared to do their job when they refused when they laid down when they sucked up when they failed to ask the tough questions when they took sides
4603379 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him its up to you to spread the truth

4603444 on thursday june 8 1978 the russian writer and dissident alexander solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 delivered the following address to a harvard graduation the split in todays world is perceptible even to a hasty glance any of our contemporaries readily identifies two world powers each of them already capable of entirely destroying the other however understanding of the split often is limited to this political conception to the illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces the truth is that the split is a much profounder and a more alienating one that the rifts are more than one can see at first glance this deep manifold split bears the danger of manifold disaster for all of us in accordance with the ancient truth that a kingdom in this case our earth divided against itself cannot stand when the modern western states were created the following principle was proclaimed governments are meant to serve man and man lives to be free to pursue happiness see for example the american declaration now at last during past decades technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the welfare state every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the achievement of happiness in the morally inferior sense which has come into being during those same decades in the process however one psychological detail has been overlooked the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression though it is customary to conceal such feelings active and tense competition permeates all human thoughts without opening a way to free spiritual development

4603448 if sleep is cut short the body doesnt have time to complete all of the phases needed for muscle repair memory consolidation and release of hormones regulating growth and appetite then we wake up less prepared to concentrate make decisions or engage fully in school and social activities
4603449 learning and restoration of our psyches takes place during sleep particularly rem allowing us to awaken in a good mood with creative ideas novel solutions to problems and ready to take on the challenges of the new day
4603450 insufficient sleep has also been associated with decreased school performance
4603451 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4603452 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4603453 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4603455 quite different from elite runners is the rate taken by many beginning runners when i have my new running classes count their own stride rates i find very few take as many as 180 steps per minute the main problem associated with slower turnover is that the slower you take your steps the longer the time you spend in the air and the more time you are in the air the higher you displace your body mass and the harder you hit the ground on landing when working with less experienced runners running economy can often be improved by converting slow turnover runners into runners using a faster rate

4603464 its pretty clear by the imagery whats going on there
4603465 and you thought by these pictures that it was proper to charge the father with accessory to rape
4603466 was going to be explored if you were flipping through the channels and didnt know what was on
4603467 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4603468 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4603469 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4603470 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4603471 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4603472 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4603473 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4603474 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4603475 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4603476 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4603477 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4603478 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4603479 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4603480 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4603481 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4603482 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4603483 but i cant think of the right word for what it is

4603510 we as people of color must develop a more balanced relationship with struggle one that encompasses not only dialogue and conflict but also love and care for ourselves and each other it can be hard to maintain nurturing relationships when we are all keenly aware of the collective sense of urgency concerning the future our communities and our planet but it is impossible to enact sustainable change when we are coming from a place of woundedness
4603511 its painful to train its even more painful to run the marathon and get to the 20 miles or eighteen miles and something happens to you and you fight through it you get through it you drink more water you slow down you cry you fight and you finish it is a great great feeling of finishing
4603512 the marathon when you run one gives you a sense of significance that no other event does i think that there is three reasons one because of the intrinsic difficulty of distance two because you are doing it in a special place it from someplace to somewhere or you go right round and there is a sense of conquering of a particular place and then three and most important is the sense of history when you run a marathon you are running in the footsteps of abebe bikila joan benoit and donald pietri and phidipedies and certainly marathon runners love to feel that they in some way added their own tiny bit to the myth
4603513 a marathon race is something begun and finished its a completion its a mental completion and a physical completion its something that stays ingrained in your soul and memory and even in your body forever and thats the beauty of it you can look back at it and its a day a part of your life that has a certain eternity to it
4603514 its when most of the development will take place our current situation should run close to normal during this period as preparations are made the third trimester will be mostly a waiting game ultimately it will be up to our new members when they decide to join to be truthful theyre very comfortable where they are right now

4603542 in de bijbel wordt gezegd dat het ontzag voor de heer het begin
4603543 i saw 37 dead civilians near arbiska where the ethiopian forces indiscriminately opened fire on two civilian buses
4603544 its a scene of complete destruction of human life everyone is dazed
4603545 they killed everyone on the buses there was blood everywhere it was unbearable to look at the scene
4603546 the ethiopian forces opened fire on the two civilian buses and they killed many i personally counted 15 just in one spot but i could not reach some of the other places where people are saying many others were killed
4603547 most of them are in shock but they explained that many civilians were indiscriminately killed
4603548 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4603549 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4603550 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4603551 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4603554 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4603555 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4603556 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4603557 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4603558 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4603559 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4603560 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4603561 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4603562 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4603571 if you take a drug of abuse whether its alcohol nicotine or cocaine or methamphetamine it doesnt matter what youre going to be doing is temporarily increasing the concentration of dopamine in the brain
4603572 so a person then has a greater risk of substance abuse because its not just that they are taking the drug because they want to get high but by taking the drug they may actually feel better and temporarily perform better
4603573 despite decades of research the specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying this disorder still remain unclear
4603574 genetic clinical and imaging studies point to a disruption of the brain dopamine system which is corroborated by the clinical effectiveness of stimulant drugs methylphenidate hydrochloride and amphetamine which increase extracellular dopamine in the brain
4603575 substance abuse is one of the many masks that add wears

4603596 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

4603601 its a terrible tragedy he was a great young man
4603602 if theres no combat outpost to abandon theres no position to abandon
4603603 its a bunch of vehicles like we do on patrol anywhere and we hold up for a night and pick up any tactical positions that we have with vehicle patrol bases
4603604 we do that routinely were always doing that when go out and stay in an area for longer then a few hours and thats what it is so there is nothing to abandon there was no structures there was no cop or fob or anything like that to even abandon so from the get go that is just expletive and its not right
4603605 as far as i know and i know a lot it was not overrun in any shape manner or form
4603606 it was close combat to be sure hand grenade range the enemy never got into the main position as a matter of fact it was i think the bravery of our soldiers reinforcing the hard pressed observation post or op that turned the tide to defeat the enemy attack

4603670 if you cant stop an outrage take the lead in it
4603671 the phsycial body closes its wounds up very quickly doesnt it where would the body be if it kept a wound open for 20 years festering with gangrene we need to learn from this i think every emotional wound deserves a period of grieving but you must be careful when you take that wound and turn it into a power to disempower yourself
4603672 is it okay to talk about your past yes but you cant keep leaving your spirit there to recreate the past
4603673 the point of meditation is to notice where your spirit goes when you arent paying attention what do you dwell on who are you thinking about as you observe these things you then need to learn to call your spirit back it will be very stubborn at first
4603674 instead of thinking you control your destiny or you create your reality just say to yourself i am responsible for the quality of my journey not the places i go or the people i meet along the way but for the way i respond to them
4603675 we age because we live in the perception that if only i could understand why this happened then i could move on and let go and in doing so we leave a peice of our soul in every one of those experiences
4603676 it doesnt matter how much your mind knows what matters is the journey between what your mind knows and forcing the rest of yourself to become congruent with it
4603677 give up the past and the need to understand and control give up blame the need to be comfortable to have an agenda and to control others
4603678 the best thing you can do is live one day at a time keep your attention in present time have no expectations make no judgements and give up the need to know why things happen as they do its lethal and its costing you your cell tissue
4603679 embrace that freedom and use it to take care of yourself to nurture yourself you deserve that now i am asking you to do this for me and for you our purpose together is done and when we come together again we will have new purpose a new experience for truly life is about the experience

4603702 essentially sodium bicarbonate is an alkali substance that increases the ph of the blood
4603703 this seems to reduce and offset the acidity produced in the muscles during intense anaerobic exercise that produces lactic acid most quickly such as fast running or swimming
4603704 it comes down to whether or not the athlete has a competitive advantage by taking an aid
4603705 and in the case of sodium bicarbonate i believe the answer is yes it violates the spirit of fair play by artificially enhancing performance
4603706 there are always going to be ethical arguments but if sports drinks and carbohydrate loading both of which can enhance performance are allowed there should be no issue with sodium bicarbonate
4603707 if you are serious about exercise and can stomach it it may help

4603798 we are excited to be a part of this ground breaking tour
4603799 it has been an amazing experience to play creation a festival we attended with our youth group when we were in high school and now to be invited to headline creation festival the tour we could not be more honored we are looking forward to heading out on the road and impacting lives together with the creation folks and the other bands
4603800 whenever jesus came to a town people became aware of gods love for them our vision for creation festival the tour is to bless people spiritually and in practical ways we want to go beyond the venue walls into the community with a touch of gods love and good news
4603801 our vision for this tour is to brand the creation festival model in a new and fresh way
4603802 we have spent countless hours in creating not just another concert but an event that has unique features and focuses heavily on the ministry component which is the foremost purpose of everything we do

4603809 the coup was illegal and illegitimate and we call for the immediate release of president abdallahi and his restoration as the legitimate president of mauritania
4603810 if the coup is not reversed we will stop aid that has been in the pipeline for much larger amounts in future years
4603811 many countries have deadlocks and political disputes between the executive and the legislature and this has to be resolved with constitutional means not through the removal of a democratically elected president
4603812 it is unfortunate that allstates disregard of florida law required the office to take the drastic actions that we did in order to bring allstate into compliance
4603813 however the terms agreed to by allstate in the consent order go a long way toward restoring confidence in allstates business practices and will provide a great benefit to their policyholders and future policyholders

4603819 it was a shame for the pub and the village when the previous landlord paul plant who ran it for about six years retired and it ceased to be a freehouse
4603820 we were concerned because the licensee at a freehouse has more choice about what beers to put on and where they get them from
4603821 freehouses are getting few and far between so it is sad to see another one go
4603822 but with the credit crunch biting it is interesting to note that most of the pubs that are struggling to keep going at the moment like the lamb in stafford which keeps opening and closing are owned by pub companies
4603823 you dont get that problem at freehouses because the landlord owns it and if trade drops off for a while they can just drop their prices and shop around to get better prices
4603824 one of the worst examples of the decline of traditional pubs is the stafford arms which has been demolished to become a car park
4603825 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea

4603834 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4603835 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4603836 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4603837 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4603838 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4603839 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4603840 if majorities of just six state delegations to the national convention in the twin cities revolt they can force a floor vote on an alternative to mccains choice
4603841 the next season is everyone just growing up you get to see miley getting her drivers licence all that good stuff and it could also help parents to see how their kids grow up
4603842 so the next season everybody is awesome everybody is amazing and seeing them growing up is just really cool it has everything miley is super talented beautiful amazing and everything and i think we all bring something to the show
4603843 when we first started out we were up from dawn til dusk chasing birds

4603847 we are putting an end to the elitist and secretive paraguay notorious for its corruption today a new country is born where the authorities will be relentless with those who steal from the people
4603848 we have been waiting and hoping for change broad ranging change for so long we need more justice
4603849 i would like education to be available for all levels of society especially the poor and dispossessed
4603850 democratising national politics developing local industry and putting an end to the structurally unfair agricultural system
4603851 from now on these lands will not only be sacred in their culture but also in terms of enforcement of the law no white person who buys or sells indigenous lands who humiliates or persecutes indigenous people will enjoy the impunity of the past crimes against indigenous people will no longer go unpunished
4603852 it would not be prudent or responsible to announce a timeframe i dont know how long it will take to provide a response to this situation and i dont know if we will be able to definitively do away with the monster of poverty but i want you to know that the children will be the personal concern of this president
4603853 is not only electoral but is a cultural wager as well perhaps the most far reaching in paraguayan history
4603854 we welcome and support the diverse regional integration efforts already underway
4603855 we commit ourselves to dialogue with the aim of ensuring that migrants continue to be seen as brothers and sisters and are treated in a humanitarian and hospitable way
4603856 we share the latin american dream of seeing our countries develop in democracy peace and prosperity but for every one of its children with the fight against injustice at the centre of our public policies
4603857 if something characterises our country it is the profound regional integration that we are engaged in
4603858 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4603859 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4603860 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4603861 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4603862 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4603863 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4603864 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4603866 drinking games and olympic games are both childish wastes of time that dont prove a thing but at least at the end of a drinking game youre drunk which is sadder a life spent on the shot putt or a life spent doing shots

4603870 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4603871 during each broadcast year the licensee shall devote not less than 50 per cent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4603872 northern peaks broadcast day will start at 6 a m and run a full 24 hours
4603873 due to the adult nature of the programming this service shall only be distributed at the specific request of the subscriber
4603874 the younger the age of exposure and the more hard core the material the more intense the effects
4603875 it becomes problematic if it interferes with other aspects of life such as school work and relationships or if these young men are getting harmful information or locked into objectifying women sexually
4603876 what people really really dont get is that what was enough yesterday and exciting yesterday is not enough today
4603877 they have to keep getting more and more so it becomes this insatiable thirst for it
4603878 as an analogy its like trauma in that people can only tolerate a certain degree of intensity
4603879 their central nervous system can only take in so much and so if the experience is so intense or so mind altering what happens is it really affects their sense of social norms what they can expect from a partner and what their own desires are get so flooded that they cant really make contact with what would be a more normal progression of sexual desire
4603880 if teenage boys admit to having romantic fantasies it could be social suicide
4603881 we shouldnt assume that a teen boy who self pleasures while looking at erotica on the internet isnt at heart just a hopeless romantic

4603888 is the constitutional grant of authority to ban mere possession of cocaine today
4603889 it is unfortunate that allstates disregard of florida law required the office to take the drastic actions that we did in order to bring allstate into compliance
4603890 however the terms agreed to by allstate in the consent order go a long way toward restoring confidence in allstates business practices and will provide a great benefit to their policyholders and future policyholders
4603891 allstates agreement to cut its rates by 5 6 percent and to begin selling more property insurance is a win for florida consumers and exhibits a commitment by the company to continue selling property insurance to florida consumers and to remain as part of the growing competitive insurance market in florida
4603892 commissioner mccarty has once again done an outstanding job fighting for and protecting the consumers of florida
4603893 what do we need to do next as a church family to make an impact in our city and world
4603894 this is a hypothetical one would you be ever interested in buying netflix
4603895 our interpretation of the results is that they were very very favorable for our device
4603896 in no test did we ever declare a channel vacant when there was a wireless microphone on it
4603897 there was never an issue of the white space device creating interference
4603898 there were some cases where we were outside the contours of a particular channel and the mast antenna showed a picture even though it was outside the contour
4603899 it was never a case that a signal was viewable
4603900 we believe that they confirm that sensing works and is adequate in protecting incumbents from white space devices
4603901 its not surprising that theyre saying that but from what were hearing they were absolutely not a success
4603902 we will be submitting and demonstrating the wireless microphone beacon next week
4603903 so that they can study and understand the device but whether and what type of tests or analysis are conducted is not clear and will be up to the fcc
4603904 the fcc has the opportunity to unleash new innovative devices and services into the marketplace while at the same time protecting broadcasters and wireless microphones from harmful interference
4603905 substantial improvement is necessary to integrate people with disabilities in emergency planning and readiness
4603906 this setback is explained by a lower level of licensing revenues than the company had anticipated since some customers delayed their decision to purchase
4603907 equal credit for this growth can be attributed to the acquisition of picdar in february 2008 and the organic increase in the companys revenues
4603908 the problem we have in the pee dee is that we have a lot of people laid off in manufacturing with very low skill levels
4603909 it is just a way for them to sell lies to try to protect themselves from the horrific crimes that they commit
4603910 im asking people in the world how can you accept this occupation if this was to happen in your country your homes you would not sleep wake up and stop it or it will get to your homes
4603911 youre just being silly now if you want the iraq war to end you should put all this wonderful energy into electing barack obama
4603912 on behalf of the several thousand people who came to the beach impeach events last year i want you to know how profoundly disappointed we are that you took impeachment off the table

4603931 the gateway p 7811fx is a great choice for customers such as students and professionals who want a notebook that can handle all of their computing needs from creating videos and playing games to tackling work school and home projects
4603932 and while the new notebook is ideal for demanding gamers and enthusiasts who want the latest technology its affordable price also makes it perfect for digital media hobbyists and casual pc game players
4603933 when i was a lad we used to get our bad cars from wartburg polski fiat british leyland and other leftwing dictatorships
4603934 oh no peace demonstrants they are always the most violent ones
4603935 wenn man alles addiert war es ein gerechtes ergebnis es gibt noch eine menge arbeit
4603936 my victory has proved that athletes with yellow skin can run as fast as those with black and white skin
4603937 if he does not win the entire stadium will empty
4603938 in my heart i would like to feel ordinary and it is hard to feel like this
4603939 he has many things he wants to do but he cant
4603940 that is why i ask our team members to do whatever we can to make him happy because many times he is alone in the room on the computer on the internet chat
4603941 my only advice to liu is to just breathe breathe breathe and to just do what you know
4603942 from an overall comparison he is stronger than me its clear he is the best hurdler out of everyone coming to the beijing games
4603943 we need somebody whos got the heart the empathy to recognize what its like to be a young teenage mom the empathy to understand what its like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old and thats the criteria by which im going to be selecting my judges
4603944 i want people on the bench who have enough empathy enough feeling for what ordinary people are going through
4603945 saying that he could no longer enter sympathetically into the motives of anyone concerned and that since justice involved feeling and not merely thinking he felt that his injury totally disqualified him
4603946 commentary on jeffery m shamans the impartial judge detachment or passion
4603947 you search the scriptures because you think you have eternal life through them even they testify on my behalf but you do not want to come to me to have life
4603948 ok try it one more time but this time how about try singing in tune
4603949 and now with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4603950 the solidarity of the united states with georgia and its people in this moment of crisis
4603951 that is americas position and in my discussions with my european colleagues it is the position of the europeans as well
4603952 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4603953 but our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4603954 and eventually we need a more robust and impartial peacekeeping international force that would follow those monitors
4603955 we are under a russian invasion and russian occupation right now
4603956 and we want to end this russian invasion and occupation
4603957 access must be immediate and unimpeded for those humanitarian efforts
4603958 when the security situation in georgia is stabilized we will turn immediately to reconstruction
4603959 to rapidly develop an economic support package for the georgian economy to build on its demonstrated track record and to resume its rapid growth
4603960 restore georgias economy and reinforce investor confidence as georgia returns to its position as the leading economy in the region
4603961 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4603962 the free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications of this russian attack on its neighbor for security in the region and beyond
4603963 your costar brandon t jackson told me there was a scene in the script where osiris downeys character in a character uses the n word and that he said it went over the line
4603964 i did not set out to offend anybody but sometimes when you are making an r rated comedy that happens
4603965 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home
4603966 it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
4603967 stick together you never know what will happen over there who are you going with 2 other couples right can you send me an itinerary of where exactly you will be and what hotels you will be staying at i know you cant carry weapons but do you know self defense just in case oh and dont forget to register with an embassy because if you dont and something happens then no one will know your over there also make sure you keep your passport close to you not in your backpack and dont leave it anywhere always double check is there a number i can reach you at how am i going to know you landed safely can you email me something while your over there so i know your still alive are you going to send me a list of things that need to get done at the house just in case dont forget emergency phone numbers like the vet i would hate to have something happen to the dogs did i tell you that charlie is allergic so dont worry he wont be coming over and taking care of them can you send me your flight information too i dont think i have that
4603968 im so glad as now i am not so intimidated by you people i meet say you are so good that i have been thinking that surely there must be cracks now you have shown me a crack i feel so much better
4603969 nada hace m s feliz al diablo que ver la poca ropa de las mujeres en las olimpiadas

4603974 in place of fathers o king you shall have sons you shall make them princes over all the earth i will make your name to be remembered from one generation to another therefore nations will praise you for ever and ever
4603975 they divided my garments among themselves and cast lots for my clothing
4603976 ik denk dat we toe moeten naar een regionaal brandweerkorps
4603977 vroeger konden per dorp een paar vrijwilligers uitrukken om een brand in een woning te gaan blussen dat werkt zo niet meer er staan overal bedrijven waarvoor specifieke kennis vereist is als er iets zou gebeuren
4603978 de belangsteling was de laatste jaren minder we merken dat jazz niet meer zo aanslaat maar we hebben dus wel orkesten op een schip en een opteden van denise jannah in de kerk
4603979 we beraden ons over de toekomst we willen het grootser aanpakken maar daarvoor is geld nodig
4603980 te zien is dat het een man van ongeveer vijftig is hij had een pet op maar is duidelijk in beeld gekomen
4603981 die hebben we in bruikleen gekregen van onze kesterense leverancier
4603982 de defibrillator bezit een unieke registratiecode en is gegraveerd net zoals de batterij omdat de linker en de rechterpad maar n keer te gebruiken zijn zal hij nieuwe moeten kopen dan dien je de code te geven en loop je dus vanzelf tegen de lamp
4603983 mede daarom hangt informatie bij het apparaat met onder meer namen en telefoonnummers als de nood aan de man komt weet iemand wie gebeld moet worden
4603984 nou meneertje doe uw trui maar even omhoog het zal even een beetje prikkelen
4603985 het is waardevol om te luisteren naar bewoners al die wensen is een onderlegger voor de jaren daarna
4603986 this was done with quite elaborate skill and these men were very schooled in what they were doing
4603987 youre not dying youre going to get better i know it
4603988 we need to collect evidence before we go to court and were not saying were going to court tomorrow but at least with the new law microsoft has to be more careful
4603989 the uptake of office is at the lowest its been in the last couple of years so while nothings put a dent in the armor at this point perhaps there is some crumbling and the opportunity for a lower priced offering to make some inroads
4603990 given its capabilities theres no indication why it wouldnt be seen as an alternative to microsoft
4603991 this is the equivalent to forcing china to pirate the product
4603992 to try and level the playing filed between western products and native products
4603993 they are understandably not happy about foreign companies owning the bulk of the software sales in their own market
4603994 local software products of any kind pay off for microsoft
4603995 once a country has its own software businesses that countrys political leaders will start to get serious about stopping piracy so microsoft might well root for evermore
4603996 the asian market represents a wealth of opportunities but i guess the bigger issue is are people going to pay for software
4603997 microsoft of course still has the lions share of the market
4603998 we dont want to compete with that for media coverage
4603999 determin las mejores palabras para el dominio con el fin de fortalecer el posicionamiento en la red de redes

4604001 given energy volatility margin pressures across the industry and in some cases liquidity concerns
4604002 however we see these challenging times as a great opportunity to place more distance between us and the rest of specialty retail
4604003 we believe this gives us a competitive advantage and is critical to our long term success
4604004 monotony of the dream like repetition of ones lonely days
4604005 character development dramatic arc linguistic dexterity and texture an operative aesthetic anathema to strict reportage authorial voice or presence subjectivity
4604006 years in which i stumbled and careened from one debacle to the next wallowing in mediocrity awash in confusion beset by the aggrieved conviction that if my uber mentor would just have the decency to show up clock in and get down to business things could start falling into place
4604007 this is no time to give a kid with barely a learners permit the keys to the car
4604008 israel is not a country delist it from facebook as a country
4604009 this phenomena is spreading anti semitism and acceptability of anti semitism in new and increasingly effective ways
4604010 now in the web 2 0 world the social acceptability of anti semitism can be spread public resistance lowered and hate networks rapidly established
4604011 community leaders tend to be the sort of people who are too busy to spend time looking at youtube videos
4604012 they are very very focused on old media which is a bit strange since a lot of people their age are online
4604013 we cant sit here all day monitoring youtube and facebook
4604014 but the minute they do the right thing and pull something down another pops up
4604015 the message thus spreads not only across geographic boundaries but also across social groups
4604016 facebook needs to delete the group israel is a terrorist country we all hate israel
4604017 they see something get annoyed and have to do something about it
4604018 a little over a year ago i was searching youtube and there was so much really really vile stuff out there
4604019 see the humane treatment of a palestinian woman by israel
4604020 i wish there were 50 guys like me downloading videos and reposting them
4604021 but the goal is to get the videos out there we need jews to take a proactive stance to educate the public
4604022 various organizations have a policy that they wont link to other sites
4604023 this is counterproductive web 2 0 is about sharing the way a web site gets popular is partly related to the number of links and how high up they are on google
4604024 organizations especially the younger ones are now realizing that facebook youtube and other such web sites are an important medium for reaching out to jewish and non jewish students alike to talk about israel
4604025 there will be 50 to 100 people in the room hearing the lecture but the number of people who can watch it on the web grows exponentially
4604026 the people who started these groups are most likely in the top 10 percent who are staunchly anti israel
4604027 as individuals we try to combat it but we need to do more
4604028 no stop dont touch that no stop biting dont touch that no do you need to go potty
4604029 its been one of those awesome spit in your face kick you in the crotch kinda days
4604030 so when did you push a human out of your va jay jay
4604031 thanks for killing the planet with your gas guzzling ego stroking vehicle especially you can afford a hybrid and i bought a dress just like that from express three days ago for 75 moron
4604032 to my sk ladies i am sorry but i have been unfaithful
4604033 possibly the most beautiful book of the twentieth century the little prince will appeal to the hearts of adults and children alike
4604034 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
4604035 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
4604036 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
4604037 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
4604038 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

4604052 one of the worst political books ever written corsi piles distortion upon innuendo to create a gigantic heap of right wing garbage with a seemingly endless parade of basic factual errors running through the text like rats corsis book is an embarrassment to the craft of journalism and any of the conservatives who have praised and promoted it should feel humiliated at how bad it truly is
4604053 now they botch a gimmie defining corsi as a nut while not putting attention on the charges he leveled
4604054 unlike most of the critics of the obama nation i have actually read the book from cover to cover it is a thoroughly well documented piece of first rate journalism are there mistakes in it show me a first edition that doesnt have some other than the bible but is it truthful does it add considerably to the publics knowledge of the front running candidate for the presidency do we know much more about obama than we would had we relied exclusively for our information from the new york times the los angeles times the washington post and the associated press i offer a resounding yes to all three of those questions i am privileged to call him my friend colleague and co worker i stand with jerry corsi today as he is viciously maligned by an attack media that would prefer to aim its potent artillery at a man who dared to do their job when they refused when they laid down when they sucked up when they failed to ask the tough questions when they took sides
4604055 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him its up to you to spread the truth
4604056 you probably got it all figured out corey if you start out depressed everythings kind of a pleasant surprise

4604073 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4604074 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4604075 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4604076 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4604077 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4604083 15 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many 17 and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready 18 and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused 19 and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused 20 and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come 21 so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind 22 and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room 23 and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled 24 for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper
4604084 1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves 2 let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification 3 for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me
4604085 28 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus 29 whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily
4604086 4 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure 5 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
4604087 it is a very good read and will open your eyes to the things that god doesnt know comments rss
4604088 44 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field 45 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls 46 who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
4604089 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
4604090 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
4604091 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
4604092 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
4604093 12 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
4604094 6 and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen

4604098 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
4604099 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
4604100 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 3 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 5 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven 6 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language 7 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans 8 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born 9 parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia 10 phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes 11 cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this 13 others mocking said these men are full of new wine 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words 15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved 22 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain 24 whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it 25 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 26 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 28 thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance 29 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day 30 therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne 31 he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear 34 for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 35 until i make thy foes thy footstool 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers 43 and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles 44 and all that believed were together and had all things common 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need 46 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
4604101 new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
4604102 1 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb 2 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations 3 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 4 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever 6 and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 7 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 8 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 9 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be 13 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last 14 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city 15 for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book 20 he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
4604103 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
4604104 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
4604105 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
4604106 17 but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you 18 being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness
4604107 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
4604108 8 yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ 9 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
4604109 17 yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all 18 for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me 19 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state
4604110 25 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven 27 and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear 29 for our god is a consuming fire
4604111 33 and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end

4604113 21 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead 22 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive 23 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
4604114 shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father
4604115 54 when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth 55 but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god 56 and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god 57 then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord 58 and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul 59 and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit 60 and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
4604116 32 but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions 33 partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used 34 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward 36 for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise
4604117 10 but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience 11 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me 12 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
4604118 6 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand 7 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
4604119 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
4604120 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus 6 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god 7 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men 8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
4604121 9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
4604122 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
4604123 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god 4 nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born 5 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
4604124 23 and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god 24 and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god 25 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
4604125 28 then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee 29 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels 30 but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life 31 but many that are first shall be last and the last first

4604418 social networks now know they cant take peoples private information and make it public without asking for permission first
4604419 a lot of the startups think that using consumer data is a magic bullet for cash flow problems if the law and lawmakers begin to take online privacy violations more seriously these companies will have to rethink their strategies as they move forward

4604445 suggested she call in a hazardous waste crew when the hazard contractor quoted us 2 000 to clean the bedroom bridges decided simply to seal off the room and make her daughter sleep elsewhere in the house while the issue was sorted out
4604446 and then the dep offered to come back out and remove the carpet for me they removed the carpet re tested everything and sealed everything in containers and disposed of it as hazardous waste
4604447 has extensive experience with other types of mercury spills but did not have experience with the mercury levels that might occur from a cfl breaking on carpet in addition to evaluating the levels in the home the department planned to use this breakage event as a means of gathering information to better respond to future events
4604448 the carpet squares of multi colored carpet was planned for removal as part of an intended renovation
4604449 the department responders work under a guidance value of 300 nanograms per cubic meter ng m3 for mercury if readings are 300 ng m3 or less the area is considered to not require any additional actions and no additional clean up advice is given in situations with values over 300 ng m3 the department responder consults with the state toxicologist for a more refined evaluation
4604450 the homeowner expressed particular nervousness about exposures to mercury even in low numbers based on that concern the responder explained two ways to minimize exposures to mercury one way was to wear respiratory protection and another way was to hire a clean up contractor
4604451 since the homeowner did not have any respirator protection the responder referred her to a commercial clean up contractor the responder further suggested that the homeowner talk with their homeowners insurance company to see if her policy would cover the cost of a professional clean up contractor
4604452 particular nervousness about exposures to mercury even in low numbers
4604453 the department tried to reach the homeowner to determine the current levels of mercury on the one spot with readings over 300 ng m3 the homeowner called the department on may 15 2007 and agreed to have the department come to her house on friday may 18 2007 to obtain measurements and potentially remove the carpet piece in question upon arrival on friday the department responder found no measurements over 300 ng m3 including at the point of impact however the carpet piece was removed by the responder at the request of the homeowner
4604454 the bag where they had placed the carpet into still had readings higher than the states danger level
4604455 found no measurements over 300 ng m3 including at the point of impact
4604456 the carpet piece was removed by the responder at the request of the homeowner
4604457 cfls do contain a small amount of mercury they do need to be properly cleaned up when broken and they need to be taken to a recycling facility for fluorescent bulbs when being disposed of

4604517 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4604518 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4604543 as an organization the aac ncdp has an opportunity to play a critical role in this historic election
4604544 we have a choice to either be an insignificant footnote or a momentous notation in the pages of north carolinas political and cultural history and if we are to make a positive impact on the 2008 election we must have an agenda the outlines clear comprehensive and effective objectives
4604545 well you know what african americans are not going to not get out and vote they will get out and vote for obama but you know what the main problem here is
4604546 white candidates have the problem because we aint going to vote for them because this is bull
4604547 the turmoil and backstabbing within the n c democratic partys african american caucus leaves me wondering if the caucus has perhaps outlived its usefulness
4604548 and for a person who says that he is the president of a democratic caucus to publicly declare that he will work to ensure that african americans in north carolina do not vote for white democratic nominees in november is racial politics at its worse and should be condemned by all reasonable thinking people
4604549 such reckless rhetoric jeopardizes the various coalitions weve established to help obama carry north carolina
4604550 as an african american voter in north carolina for the past 45 years and a member in good standing of the north carolina democratic partys state executive committee i am hereby appealing to the chairman and other party leaders to officially disband the caucus for due cause of a serious breach of its founding mission
4604551 at the moment i can not foresee any other resolution which would compel the african american caucus to be an asset going forward
4604552 i dont think that kind of talk on either side is helpful and the truth is they represent a tiny minority of democrats
4604553 most black democrats are not going to refuse to vote for white democrats and most democrats who supported hillary clinton are going to gladly vote for barack obama
4604554 we ought to focus on all those millions of people who really want to do the right thing for the country instead of those who want to divide us
4604555 there are some rumors floating around that the obama campaign is looking at the possibility of putting some gotv get out the vote money in north carolina and that theyre going to funnel the money through the state democratic partys african america caucus
4604556 if you can verify whether thats true or not because if its true

4604564 we look forward to working with the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the people affected by the fire to make the sba disaster loans available to homeowners renters and businesses

4604566 the sbas customer service representatives will be on hand at the disaster loan outreach center to issue loan applications answer questions about the sbas disaster loan program explain the application process and help individuals complete their applications

4604580 we look forward to working with the commonwealth of massachusetts making our loans available to small businesses that sustained economic injury due to this fire
4604581 we will be swift in our efforts to help the business owners with their working capital needs
4604582 the sba can help these small businesses overcome their economic losses by offering these working capital loans but the help cannot start until they submit an sba disaster loan application to us
4604583 fits within the companys mission to acquire explore and develop unconventional oil in western canada and therefore we intend to ask the province to repost these permits for bidding
4604584 the report indicates we are seeing the manufacturing sector shift back into expansion after both domestic and foreign demand picked up in the second quarter
4604585 with the rest of the world now joining the u s in slowing down the prospects for holding the dollar have brightened considerably
4604586 i think what it shows is we have a very competitive marketplace here in saskatchewan and the companies are responding to that
4604587 they see a royalty structure they see a regulatory structure they see a business climate that is very very positive
4604588 the companies look at it bid what they think is appropriate and then as the ministry we look and see whether we feel that its competitive or not
4604589 in this case we didnt think that was the case and withdrew them
4604590 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network
4604591 a network that provides superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings with great content
4604592 i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and will continue to work with them and support their networks
4604593 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors

4604595 keep going please ive still got to pay for it
4604596 all i know is that there is proposals were looking at and therell be some money left over after everythings done and we might be able to use them here in p e i thats still on the drawing boards

4604729 i urge the parties the pakistani military and president musharraf to resolve this crisis within the bounds of pakistani law and i urge the bush administration to refrain from any actions which might appear to thwart the will of the pakistani people

4604741 when im out there now i feel like i have my swagger back and im very confident in everything i do
4604742 everything is not new to him you could tell this offseason we started talking about it right at the beginning of our ota days that he looked different he just looks confident and he is stronger and bigger so that helps him as well

4604752 it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years but the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries

4604772 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4604773 so deep was ralph reed involved in jack abramoffs schemes to bilk his clients and advance gambling interests so caught up in the washington culture of corruption was ralph reed that he lost a party primary in georgia for lieutenant governor in 2006 but even after all that disgrace after all that controversy after the reports of tainted money john mccain is depending on ralph reed of all people to fill his campaign coffers
4604774 raising money with ralph reed shows that the john mccain who ran in 2000 would have a hard time considering voting for the john mccain we see today senator mccain has changed hes taking advice from karl rove and karl roves minions and now hes adopting karl rove and dick cheney anything goes style of low road politics the john mccain who used to go out and try to root out this sort of corruption is now appearing to me to be a desperate candidate who will say anything and raise money anywhere with absolutely anyone to pay for a lot of the false and negative ads that we have seen
4604775 here in louisiana he started off touting ethics reform as his gold standard but he gutted the system with a
4604776 we do think that gov jindal would be an interesting pick for john mccain because in him youve got someone who served in the bush administration voted with him in lockstep when he was in congress and has toed the line as a governor too so if john mccain picks him hes hit the trifecta of someone who would be most like george bush and dick cheney
4604777 we can go down the list on issue after issue whether its jobs disaster recovery law enforcement funding health care hes taken his lead from the republicans and voted right down the line with george bush and dick cheney

4604790 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4604791 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4604792 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4604793 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4604794 weve come a long way since last year jimmie johnson was second at 187 028 but his lap was more than three tenths of a second slower than vickers on the 2 mile oval
4604795 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4604796 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4604797 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4604798 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4604799 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy

4604851 weve been there already longer than we should have been there and ive come around to the notion that we never should have gone in the first place
4604852 that to me is an astonishing result and just about the polar opposite of the result we wanted to accomplish when we went in there
4604853 be that as it may this is still an utterly unsustainable undertaking that were involved in and weve got to get out of it just as soon as we can in my opinion theres no easy way out i think weve just got to get out
4604854 no matter what you hear from anybody or any group there is no silver bullet thats going to fix this
4604855 i guess we were stirred from our sleep for a short period of time but we never woke up i dont know why we never woke up but we became very complacent and something we should have been working on some in the 70s we just put on the back burner

4604877 though it does not appear that he means to confuse he does speak with a thoughtful lack of clarity
4604878 for obama jesus isnt a magical creature to be worshiped blindly hes a real person to be imitated for his moral example whats important to obama about jesus is not the night of the living dead aspects of a christian belief in resurrection but the moral lessons about self sacrifice for a larger cause

4604908 for fiscal 3q08 brocade reported upside revenue 365 7 million and non gaap eps 0 16 results versus the street estimates 351 7 million and 0 14
4604909 upside revenue in the quarter was driven by switch embedded and service revenue contributions as the director business performance was rather muted even though brocade is currently in a major director product refresh cycle
4604910 despite solid enterprise level visibility into the ongoing director product cycle macroeconomic imposed conservatism led to brocade providing a below normal seasonal sequential increase for revenue for the october 2008 quarter 3 5 versus 6 8 however the revenue outlook was still above the street consensus estimate non gaap eps outlook was in line
4604911 total revenue grew 3 sequentially and 12 year over year 9 year over year excluding the sbs acquisition that closed in the april 2008 quarter
4604912 core san revenue increased 4 year over year and 1 sequentially as switch revenue growth 5 12 year over year offset muted trends in the director business down sequentially 3 year over year
4604913 embedded switch revenue continued to report very strong results 12 sequentially 39 year over year
4604914 meanwhile service revenue continued its healthy performance with 8 sequential and 43 year over year growth
4604915 the oem revenue mix was flat sequentially at 86 reflecting 3 sequential and 14 year over year growth emc hp and ibm each greater than 10 of revenue totaled 62 of revenue reflecting growth trends 2 sequentially 8 year over year below the corporate figures
4604916 geographically brocade noted that north american demand was stronger than expected 40 mix china and india continued their healthy growth rates and japan experienced a slowdown
4604917 driven by an improved product gross margin total gross margin improved 80 basis points sequentially to 61 9 which was above the companys outlook of 59 60 the sequential average selling price decline continued to be in the low single digits and brocade expects this trend to continue for the october 2008 quarter operating margin was at 22 6 down 30 basis points sequentially but still above the companys outlook for the quarter 19 20 and its long term range of 18 22
4604918 net cash totaled 421 million at quarters end which included 169 million of convertible debt that matures in february 2010 and a 160 million current liability associated with the recent share litigation settlement for the first time over the past five quarters inventory increased on a sequential basis which we believe likely reflects brocades completion of reducing its legacy product inventory while the new 8gb product inventory ramps reflecting a relatively linear quarter days sales outstanding were flat sequentially and down two days year over year to 43 and were well within the companys targeted range of 40 50 days
4604919 on a trailing 12 month basis brocade posted 294 million in cash flow from operations 140 million in capital expenditures and free cash flow to the firm fcff of 154 million on a diluted share basis ttm july 2008 fcff declined to 0 39 versus 0 51 for ttm april 2008 due to the large increase in capital expenditures which was mostly attributable to the new headquarter campus construction in the quarter brocade repurchased 38 million of its shares or 1 3 of basic shares outstanding and had 414 million remaining under the buyback authorization which was suspended during the quarter due to the proposed foundry acquisition and the associated large upcoming debt raise
4604920 the foundry formula this proposed combination addresses the cisco threat in terms of product and go to market
4604921 ciscos increasing focus on ethernet as a unified fabric for the data center presents a long term threat to brocades fibre channel switching franchise with a broader portfolio that includes deep ethernet capabilities brocade can neutralize this threat
4604922 foundry also brings a more direct go to market model that can be leveraged to reduce brocades dependency on oem channels and more effectively fight ciscos larger presence originally provided at the mid september 2007 analyst day presentation brocades long term operating profile includes gross margin of 57 60 and operating margin of 18 22 notably current street consensus estimates for brocade on a standalone basis assume margins above this target operating range yet brocade has referenced street consensus in providing accretion guidance for the deal in our view this suggests that brocades internal plan for standalone fy09 operating margin is closer to street than to guide or that management believes the operating synergy potential in the combination with foundry is greater than publicly indicated i e the actual accretion potential is greater than indicated
4604923 director level brocade is currently in the midst of its first major product cycle refresh since the mcdata acquisition we believe the majority of brocades key oems are now selling both the dcx and 48k 8gb fibre channel directors the company reported total director revenue was seasonally down on a sequential basis and up only 3 year over year in the july 2008 quarter which was a marked slowdown from the april 2008 quarters results 5 sequentially 19 year over year brocade attributed this to normal seasonality as for the coming quarters we believe brocades ability to execute on this director cycle is a primary catalyst for near to intermediate upside revenue and gross margin potential
4604924 competitively brocade does not expect cisco in the market with an 8gb mds solution until the end of calendar 2008 additionally the recently introduced nexus converged director platform with its ethernet centric approach is not expected to gain material traction until the calendar 2009 time frame coinciding with more substantial progress on the data center ethernet dce and fibre channel over ethernet fcoe standards
4604925 hba intentions while brocade initially leveraged an lsi sourced product as an on ramp into the 4gb market the company announced in june 2008 the availability of the internally developed 8gb fibre channel platform brocade expects initial hba revenue in the second half of 2008 and more material revenue contribution in fy09 both hds and fujitsu siemens have committed to qualify and sell the 8gb offering and brocade expects additional oem qualifications in the october 2008 quarter to be monitored is the extent to which brocade can penetrate the existing stronghold on the adapter market currently shared by qlogic and emulex
4604926 ilm deliverance brocade continues to invest significant resources in expanding its emerging portfolio of information lifecycle management ilm software and service offerings while fan revenue continued to be an immaterial piece of business in the july 2008 quarter down sequentially and year over year service revenue strength helped recent execution 17 of revenue 19 sequentially 32 year over year excluding the impact of the recent acquisition of strategic business systems sbs organic service revenue still grew well on a year over year basis at roughly 20 finally go to market partnerships with hds ibm and netapp are expected to drive continued performance in the coming quarters
4604927 based on our valuation and historical metric analysis we estimate potential forward 12 month p es of 15x 8x on upside downside execution brocade guided for upside revenue but in line non gaap eps relative to the street consensus estimates for the october 2008 quarter given the in line non gaap eps outlook we assume neutral execution sentiment over the near term which implies a near term trading range of 7 8 however the shares may get some support over the coming weeks as faster money trades the upcoming analyst day september 17th
4604928 on a 12 month basis we maintained our 9 price target sector perform rating and above average risk assessment

4604955 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4604956 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4604957 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4604958 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4604959 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4604960 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4604961 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4604962 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4605052 the autobiographies of workers in the sex industry are notoriously unreliable even more prone to the attentions of ghost writers than are the memoirs of sportsmen linda lovelaces biggest rival in the early 1970s was the prostitute and madam xaviera hollander its pronounced like in riviera but with a zah sound in front zah viera her memoirs co written by robin moore and yvonne dunleavy were published as the happy hooker and were a huge huge seller over 10 million sold according to this 1975 reprint and its a pleasure to discover that unlike lovelace she doesnt claim to have been forced into her career and to this day maintains a position of celebrating both sex and her own fame

4605081 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4605082 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4605083 radiometric methodologies would have to be out by a factor of 3 4 of a million
4605084 polystrate trees prove several things 1 the layers that they penetrate did not take millions of years to form 2 coal does not take millions of years to form since polystrate trees sometimes penetrate multiple seams 3 coal is formed from floating trees not peat 4 the rock strata between the coal layers did not take millions of years to form 5 the fossils embedded within the strata do not represent millions of years of evolution
4605085 1 that is not all that hard to explain 2 hello one ringy dingy two ringy dingy i dont either apology accepted if that is what it was like i said we can move beyond kindergarten if you will stop throwing your bottle out of the crib and screaming for your binky

4605117 about two years ago i watched mary kate smoke a marijuana joint and pass it on to friends when they were all at a party together
4605118 then there were her friends who definitely did drugs i especially remember three hangers on two guys and a girl i would call them drug dealers
4605119 i saw them with cocaine and they also tried to provide it to other people i also saw them with pures which are tablets like ecstasy
4605120 because shes so tiny a little booze would have a big effect on her
4605121 colleagues told me that on at least two occasions she had so much to drink that she had to be carried to her car
4605122 even in high school she liked to drink vodka with fruit juice or mixer mary kate would get so blasted that her sister ashley would pull her aside and tell her to stop
4605123 when she was 16 her weight dropped below 80 pounds i remember ashley telling me at the time mary kate just wont eat my family is going nuts we didnt know what to do so we put her in the hospital
4605124 wed try to get her to eat but shed only get mad and growl just leave me alone if im not hungry im not hungry

4605171 sei que jogadores como zico e rom rio jogaram aqui sou jovem mas sei que o zico foi muito importante para o clube espero estrear o quanto antes
4605172 o flamengo um clube muito forte passou agora por um momento dif cil mas est se recuperando joguei no river plate e estou acostumado a press o jogar aqui ser um prazer enorme
4605173 eu estava treinando no river e estou bem fiz uma boa pr temporada e estou em atividade venho para somar ao grupo e quando o treinador precisar estarei disposi o sou um jogador de meio campo caindo pelo lado esquerdo que gosta de chegar ao ataque e chutar de longa dist ncia
4605174 a marca o ser muito forte com certeza o vanderlei luxemburgo pedir uma marca o forte mas tenho que criar os meus espa os se eu ficar muito marcado com certeza deixarei espa os no meio de campo e outros jogadores do coritiba v o aproveitar para marcar os gols que precisamos
4605175 nenhum jogador quer fazer parte de um time que caiu para a segunda divis o isso chato para a carreira de qualquer um e por isso vamos lutar para que n o aconte a no atl tico pr cabe aos jogadores e comiss o t cnica sair dessa situa o e posso garantir ao torcedor que esse grupo tem muita qualidade

4605184 wissen sie wir sind zurzeit nicht so viele die auf der b hne stehen bush ist am ende seines rennens blair ist nicht mehr da merkel nein das ist es nicht da gibts nur mich berall werden titelgeschichten ber mich gemacht wenn obama kommt wird mir das arbeit abnehmen
4605185 das ist mir schei egal was diese ganzen idioten denken hast du schon meine uhr gesehen
4605186 du bist zwar nicht der stern in meiner nudelsuppe aber die nutella auf meinem br tchen
4605187 wir haben beschlossen den halbblut prinz in den juli zu verlegen der sommer ist ein perfekter termin f r den kinostart
4605188 die bayern dass sie sich den v llig unerfahrenen j rgen klinsmann als vereinstrainer geholt haben ist das gr te bundesliga wagnis der vergangenen jahrzehnte
4605189 es besteht absolut die gefahr dass er auf die schnauze f llt auch weil manchmal zu viele ideen gleichzeitig durch seinen kopf schwirren auf mich wirkt das zuweilen nervig ich bin sicher nicht der einzige der so denkt
4605190 super wenn seine mannschaft jetzt mehr tore schie t und sch ner spielt
4605191 ja trotz etlicher turbulenzen schafft es bayern mit knappem vorsprung
4605192 schalke bremen und dann habe ich schon wolfsburg auf dem zettel weil felix magath dort richtig kohle raushauen darf aber er liefert ja auch gute arbeit ab
4605193 absolut ber weite strecken hat die truppe eine erstaunlich gute vorstellung geboten das alte leiden jedoch die jungs haben zu wenig tore gemacht
4605194 unsere chancen stehen h chstens fifty fifty absoluter mist ist nat rlich dass farfan die n chste zeit ausf llt es hat mir imponiert wie frech der aufgetreten ist ohne ihn wird das r ckspiel sauschwer
4605195 das wird ebenfalls ne hei e kiste und hochgradig gef hrlich die mannschaft muss total konzentriert auftreten
4605196 du erkennst auf dem spielfeld sofort dass bei ihm endlich wieder ordnung und disziplin ganz oben in der werteliste stehen mit rutten hat andy m ller eine gute wahl getroffen
4605197 ich gebe zu er befand sich in einem gro en konflikt trotzdem die art wie er sich abgesetzt hat bezeichne ich als flegelhaftes benehmen das war ein stich ins herz der fans der verein muss dar ber nachdenken ob rafinha es weiter verdient hat unser trikot zu tragen
4605198 die truppe malocht vorbildlich es fehlen aber berraschende spielz ge zauberp sse lincoln hat sie fr her mal bei uns geschlagen schade dass er am ende so undiszipliniert wurde dass du ihn nicht mehr gebrauchen konntest aber das ist ja das problem der gesamten bundesliga bis auf bayerns rib ry und bremens diego fehlen die absoluten topspieler
4605199 ich bin skeptisch in mainz stand er dort ziemlich unter artenschutz bei borussia stehst du nach mehreren verkorksten jahren vom ersten tag an wahnsinnig unter druck ob klopp den aush lt seinen kader finde ich jedenfalls nicht optimal
4605200 karlsruhe ger t in schwierigkeiten cottbus ist in der verlosung und mit bochum und bielefeld sind leider auch zwei westklubs hochgradig gef hrdet
4605201 ein ganz bl des gef hl selbst mit dem gedanken im hinterkopf dass man irgendwann in der saison bei einem klub wieder einsteigen k nnte aber die ganze vorbereitung die trainingslager das fehlt total
4605202 ja das ist auch eine wichtige erfahrung aber das hat wenig mit dem kerngesch ft fu ball zu tun ich geh re auf die bank
4605203 trainer bei den roten das kann ich mir nicht vorstellen abgesehen davon ist dieter hecking genau der richtige f r hannover ich bin es nicht
4605204 ich will nicht in der stadt trainer sein in der ich mit meiner familie lebe der ganze ffentliche druck w rde auch das familienleben stark beeinflussen nein ich bin grunds tzlich kein trainer kandidat f r hannover 96
4605205 es gibt immer wieder spannende anfragen aus der t rkei aus griechenland intensiv verhandelt habe ich tats chlich nur mit sterreich diese nationalmannschaft hat mich schon sehr gereizt aber ich will in der bundesliga bleiben f r mich muss es nach schalke noch eine zweite station geben ich m chte meine arbeit best tigen um nachhaltig zu bleiben
4605206 ja klar mein sohn luk ist jetzt 3 der hat mich in den letzten monaten mehr gesehen als in den drei jahren davor zusammen wir haben mit der familie urlaub gemacht ohne dass ich jeden tag vier stunden telefoniert habe und meine tochter lilith hat n chste woche ihren 1 tag auf dem gymnasium und der vater ist dabei das ist was besonderes
4605207 ich glaube schalke gewinnt eine kleine chance f r 96 ist dass sie vielleicht platt sind von mittwoch und das r ckspiel in madrid ist sicher das wichtigere spiel f r schalke
4605208 in der offensive haben sie sich sensationell verst rkt einfach berragend sie k nnen jetzt vorne alles spielen ein st rmer zwei oder drei aber hinten gab es letzte saison 56 gegentore
4605209 aus meiner sicht h tte ich hinten was getan da scheint was nicht zu passen und das mit enke im tor deutschlands nr 1
4605210 im tor brauchst du eine pers nlichkeit das ist enke er ist ruhig gelassen hat schon alles mitgemacht sportliche und private krisen erfolge er war im ausland adler und neuer sind super torh ter mit ganz gro em potential aber enke ist f r mich die die nr 1
4605211 ich bin fest davon berzeugt dass er gro en erfolg mit bayern hat die arbeitsbedingungen das umfeld sein trainer team alles absolut top ich bin aber nicht sicher ob j rgen und seine familie das durchhalten so im t glichen fokus der ffentlichkeit ich wei nicht ob das sein leben ist
4605212 es geht kaum ein weg an den bayern vorbei bremen und schalke werden die h rtesten verfolger wolfsburg wird vielleicht die berraschung
4605213 sie k nnen daran kratzen wenn alles gut l uft dann muss cherundolo eine berragende saison spielen isma l verletzungsfrei bleiben und tarnat 25 spiele machen
4605214 auf jeden fall gehe ich eine woche zu real madrid mich interessieren die trainingsabl ufe und die individuelle betreuung neben einem deutschen trainer ist nun auch noch van der vaart da real ist der gr te klub ein blick hinter die kulissen lohnt sich
4605215 bis zum start hat es ziemlich lange gedauert aber mit solchen st rungen muss man umgehen k nnen in der nacht vor dem finale war ich um 2 uhr mal auf bin das rennen im kopf durchgegangen da habe ich gewonnen allerdings ohne gegner ich habe keinen druck gesp rt die breite masse schwimmt so gut da lastete der druck nicht auf mir mein trainer meinte das rennen w rde auf den letzten 15 metern entschieden ich habe meinen ring umgedreht meinen gl cksbringer in dem die namen meiner br der eingraviert sind das mache ich vor jedem wettkampf
4605216 ich wusste dass die m dels es schnell angehen lassen ich wollte mein eigenes rennen schwimmen das feld war so hochkar tig da h tte jeder gewinnen k nnen libby weltrekordhalterin lisbeth trickett d red schwimmt sehr schnell an ich schwimme eher gleichm ig deshalb bin ich mit geschlossenen augen geschwommen um mich nicht ablenken zu lassen ich habe nur auf die markierung auf dem beckengrund geachtet um in meiner bahn zu bleiben und nicht in die seile zu ballern ich hatte keine ahnung was um mich herum passiert das war gut so sonst h tte ich wahrscheinlich schon bei der wende aufgegeben
4605217 ich habe die letzten meter nur libby neben mir gesehen und dachte ich habe sie ganz gut im griff eigentlich m sste ich vor ihr sein beim anschlag habe ich erstmal nicht auf die anzeige geschaut ich wusste nicht auf welchem platz ich lag ich dachte mir nur es war ein fantastisches rennen genie e diesen augenblick er ist einzigartig erst dann habe ich geguckt ich konnte es nicht fassen ich dachte ich bin im traum und gleich werde ich wach und dann stehe ich auf dem startblock ich habe keine schmerzen gesp rt bei gold tut nichts mehr weh
4605218 von acht l ufern im finale werden acht gedopt sein
4605219 der unterschied zwischen 10 0 und 9 7 sekunden sind die drogen
4605220 ich bin nur die ersten 50 meter gerannt dann habe ich mich umgeschaut um sicher zu gehen dass ich in sicherheit bin
4605221 seit meinem sieg schlafe ich nur noch zwei stunden aber das ist mir ja so egal
4605222 interviews auf franz sisch schaffe ich noch aber bei den brasilianern wurde es schwierig
4605223 nach meinem sieg hatte ich tierisch hunger doch erst nachts um drei gab es essen
4605224 ich habe eine autogrammkarte von ihr darauf steht du wirst mal eine ganz gro e
4605225 keiner kann von uns verlangen dass wir denjenigen die hand reichen die uns bespitzeln
4605226 wenn die spd darauf besteht werden wir zusammen mit den gr nen unsere gegenposition deutlich machen
4605227 zun chst hatten wir sogar den einriss des innenmeniskus und eine op bef rchtet jetzt braucht orlando wenigstens nicht unters messer die verletzung muss vernarben
4605228 zwei drei wochen aber vielleicht auch weniger wir versuchen absolut alles dass er beim r ckspiel in madrid wieder dabei ist
4605229 schade farfan und engelaar sind wichtige spieler aber jetzt sind andere wichtig wir wollen chef im eigenen stadion sein doch wenn du sofort eine englische woche hast wird s hart
4605230 ich besch ftige mich nicht mit einem fehlstart wir k nnen immer noch eine truppe aufbieten die 96 trotzdem schl gt
4605231 besser ich habe trainiert ich glaube f r das reck finale am dienstag wird alles gut
4605232 da hatte ich h llische schmerzen ich konnte den finger nicht nach hinten abrollen und biegen das problem war die schmerzstillende spritze die ich bekam wirkte erst nach 24 stunden sie wirkte erst nach dem mehrkampffinale aber f r das reckfinale brauche ich kein tape mehr auch auf eine spritze habe ich keinen bock mehr
4605233 das glauben viele doch ich sage allen hier noch mal meine nerven halten die patzer sind einfach menschlich
4605234 wir kompensierten den mangel an liebe zuwendung verst ndnis und seelischer geborgenheit mit teuren geschenken und ppigem taschengeld
4605235 als uns endlich aufging was da geschah war es zu sp t
4605236 doch der entzug gelang wie auch sp ter ein paar mal nur f r kurze zeit fast bis zum ende ihres lebens geriet sie immer wieder in die abh ngigkeit von drogen und alkohol
4605237 abermals suchte ich verzweifelt die hilfe der gerichte diesmal um ein ruhen des sorgerechts meiner tochter f r unsere enkelin zu erwirken
4605238 es ist bitter genug f r einen alten mann wie mich wenn er sein eigenes kind begraben muss doch viel viel bitterer ist es zu wissen dass man als miserabler vater an diesem fr hen tod ein geh riges ma an mitverantwortung tr gt

4605279 he made contact with an alien at the roswell landing and since has been searching for other alien life forms i find him to be a cutthroat character willing to do what is needed to survive
4605280 ive been a huge fan of the pulp sci fi serials dime novels movies and comics from the 1930s to the 1950s for most of my life
4605281 in fact my earliest memory of television was watching a rerun of the 50s serial commando cody sky marshall of the universe needless to say ive loved the classic media from the golden age of science fiction since childhood and really wanted to create a book that paid tribute to that wondrous era youll also see some twilight zone and outer limits influence in the story as well rod serling and leslie stevens were phenomenal screenwriters in my estimation
4605282 and put it into a development folder i had just signed a contract with shadowline to make the surreal adventures of edgar allan poo so that was my focus after the success of poo book 1 which received harvey and eagle award nominations i might add and archibald saves christmas i decided to pull m theory from my computer and pitch it to jim valentino and kris simon at shadowline kris immediately loved it and i signed a contract a couple days after pitching it
4605283 ive wanted to see a book like this for so long to actually be the one to make it happen thats even better i love all my books for various reasons but m theory is definitely one that is closer to my heart its basically a nostalgic love letter to the marvelous age of pulp sci fi that engaged my imagination as a child and still engages me today
4605284 when i read the script the first thing i thought of was the planet of the apes its a tense ride that hits you below the belt in the end
4605285 i went into this project blindly i was over thinking everything and that was just making it incredibly difficult i simplified the characters down to shapes once i had the right gestures i just built off of those its a simple and fun style of the cartoon element
4605286 its a pretty taut science fiction thriller with depth for the adults but its also an action adventure story with jet packs laser rays robots and flying saucers that can be enjoyed by any reader regardless of age
4605287 this miniseries definitely concludes but like the great old sci fi serials it ends in a cliffhanger of sorts
4605288 i would definitely love to do more m theory stories but whether that happens or not is entirely up to retailers and fans so please buy buy buy
4605289 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn
4605290 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4605291 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4605292 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4605293 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4605294 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4605295 we were not looking for bigfoot we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did

4605324 based on my safeway encounters i came to think of weinberger as a basic sort of guy candid and no nonsense which is the way much of official washington saw him

4605344 steve farber is involved with a lot of high level candidates and ones who have won
4605345 hes famous for hiring ex politicians their children and ex judges hes very good at making connections with people who have access to politicians
4605346 he is a businessman and a community activist and yet he is connected to a law firm that is one of the biggest in washington when any of steve farbers clients have a problem federal elected officials will feel obligated to listen to him if he approaches them later on federal policy interests

4605353 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4605354 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4605355 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4605356 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4605357 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming

4605369 how well do you think israel is doing its part in the effort to resolve the israel palestinian conflict
4605370 american foreign policy has been and must continue to be based on unequivocal support for israels right to exist and to be free from terror
4605371 it is unacceptable for the u s to be evenhanded on these fundamental issues this is not a time to be sending mixed messages on the contrary in these difficult times we must reaffirm our unyielding commitment to israels survival and raise our voices against all forms of terrorism and incitement
4605372 sources in the jewish community say that dean has wrecked his chances of getting significant contributions from jews
4605373 many believe deans statement will drive more jews toward lieberman and kerry enabling kerry to take the lead again
4605374 howard made some comments in someones backyard in new mexico that were shorthand if you will for some of his middle east views in the course of those remarks and some others in the subsequent days he used some language that gave people consternation and it was immediately jumped on by joe lieberman and john kerry that somehow howard dean was breaking faith with this 55 year tradition of the united states special relationship with israel which is patently absurd
4605375 this suggests you cannot be firmly committed to israel and question israels hawkish prime minister ariel sharons policies if thats where democrats put themselves they dont leave room to debate bush on the issue

4605406 we also recommend that the government should immediately carry out an exhaustive analysis of current us interrogation techniques on the basis of such information as is publicly available or which can be supplied by the us
4605407 the committees conclusions amount to saying we can no longer rely on assurances from a us administration that purports to uphold the civil and political standards of behaviour

4605413 where he pratically begs mccain to run for president as a democrat
4605414 mccain could redefine the democratic party once again as the champion of wilsonian interventionism
4605415 only a handful of politicians per generation capture the publics imagination and channel it toward moral and rational ends
4605416 mccains truth telling and his war against soft money made him a hero to the liberal press

4605426 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4605427 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4605428 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4605429 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4605436 you had uptempo stuff like prince just this loud bass music and this guy talking about sex
4605437 plus those nissan trucks came out with all the speakers in the back so electro sounded really good
4605438 we were all living in compton driving to dj gigs like we always did but because police were cracking down on gangs and drugs now were getting pulled over

4605453 i think the russian leadership knows exactly where president bush and the united states and the international community stand
4605454 but when the president speaks hes sending a signal to the rest of the world also sending a signal especially to countries that have recently transitioned to democracy that the united states will stand with you and to stay strong
4605455 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians
4605456 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future

4605459 every public survey we have seen indicates that we have effectively consolidated the base around john mccain we have a higher intensity of support around our republican base than the democrats have around theirs
4605460 young people throughout the primaries and caucuses were overwhelmingly on obamas side over hillary clinton and the other democratic candidates
4605461 and in the polls so far in the general election there is a huge age gap with younger people backing obama by double digits and older people people over 50 and people over 65 for sure supporting senator mccain
4605462 it is unfortunate that allstates disregard of florida law required the office to take the drastic actions that we did in order to bring allstate into compliance
4605463 however the terms agreed to by allstate in the consent order go a long way toward restoring confidence in allstates business practices and will provide a great benefit to their policyholders and future policyholders
4605464 the resolution of this matter demonstrates our desire to work with the office of insurance regulation and to put the issues in dispute behind us
4605465 allstate must continue to cooperate with the offices investigation of its claim payment practices including matters related to the 1992 mckinsey report
4605466 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4605467 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4605468 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4605469 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4605470 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4605471 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4605472 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4605473 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4605474 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4605475 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4605476 the idea that they would refuse to sign a final order that is the height of amazing nerve
4605477 the organization and everything else is just unreal the accommodation the food is lovely
4605478 the recent several days have had very good conditions indeed
4605479 they sit around in small groups some in yellow shirts some in red shirts
4605480 they do not understand the rules of the game they cheer its a little bit funny
4605481 if we were dealers we could make an extreme profit
4605482 the organization and everything else is just unreal the accommodation the food is lovely
4605483 the recent several days have had very good conditions indeed
4605484 they sit around in small groups some in yellow shirts some in red shirts
4605485 they do not understand the rules of the game they cheer its a little bit funny
4605486 if we were dealers we could make an extreme profit
4605487 could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition
4605488 this administration is out of time to do a rigorous objective award for a major weapons program
4605489 it would be different if the gao had identified minor mistakes but it found major major problems there is simply not enough time to fix those problems
4605490 i almost felt like writing her a note i like you
4605491 but chan is 44 now achy kneed balding and divorced his days and nights punctuated by the vibrations of a department of homeland security
4605492 the olympics i know theyre the biggest thing in the world
4605493 its great but also its a chance for me to meet people from all over the world
4605494 whatever minutes i get i have to play 100 percent
4605495 to be in beijing there are a lot of emotions but its very special
4605496 hes in a different situation than we were hes playing in the olympics but out here age doesnt matter hes 17 kidd is 35 it dont matter
4605497 he has some pretty good veteran guys whove made it to where he wants to go so listen to those older guys
4605498 work hard never be satisfied because youll always need to work on your game
4605499 its one dream to go to the nba thats true i have to say the truth its a dream for everybody to play in the best league in the world
4605500 the olympics i know theyre the biggest thing in the world
4605501 its great but also its a chance for me to meet people from all over the world

4605507 its one dream to go to the nba thats true i have to say the truth its a dream for everybody to play in the best league in the world
4605508 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
4605509 had the child been concealed and ran out from behind a bush or whatever the results could have been just absolutely awful
4605510 heats water up in a coffee maker to wash dishes
4605511 all those shaky loans are out there and the foreclosures are coming
4605512 what makes the subprime mortgages so devastating from a community perspective is that theyre so concentrated geographically
4605513 when folks pay for a home they expect to die in it
4605514 the rising number of foreclosures threatens to undermine the stability
4605515 is that subprime lenders have targeted our seniors and african americans people who saved all their lives to get a step up
4605516 you have to consider the possibility that god does not like you
4605517 condoms dont belong in school and neither does al gore hes not a schoolteacher
4605518 the information thats being presented is a very cockeyed view of what the truth is the bible says that in the end times everything will burn up but that perspective isnt in the dvd
4605519 global warming is real and god is doing it to punish you
4605520 from what ive seen of the movie and what my husband has expressed to me if the movie is going to take the approach of bad america bad america i dont think it should be shown at all
4605521 if youre going to come in and just say america is creating the rotten ruin of the world i dont think the video should be shown
4605522 thats a new one to me are there many freaky christians running around claiming
4605523 condoms dont belong in school and neither does al gore hes not a schoolteacher
4605524 global warming is real and god is doing it to punish you
4605525 the requirement to represent another side follows district policy to represent both sides of a controversial issue board president ed barney said
4605526 from what ive seen of the movie and how much would that be and what my husband has expressed to me oh now were getting somewhere if the movie is going to take the approach of bad america bad america i dont think it should be shown at all
4605527 the information thats being presented is a very cockeyed view of what the truth is the bible says that in the end times everything will burn up but that perspective isnt in the dvd

4605530 it ended when the rate of glacial retreat was maximal
4605531 it ended when a key geographic feature bering land bridge uk connected to europe western indonesia connected to asia etc returned to a warm period state
4605532 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
4605533 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
4605534 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
4605535 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
4605536 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
4605537 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
4605538 an important reason to study metacognitive monitoring processes is because monitoring is supposed to play a central role in directing how people study
4605539 our research affects issues of cognitive intellectual development and can be used to develop training programs particularly for young children to ensure adequate metacognitive processing in educational contexts
4605540 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
4605541 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
4605542 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
4605543 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
4605544 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4605545 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4605546 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
4605547 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
4605548 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
4605549 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
4605550 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
4605551 although its more like a one two three four punch
4605552 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
4605553 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
4605554 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
4605555 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
4605556 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
4605557 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
4605558 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
4605559 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
4605560 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
4605561 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
4605562 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscape what color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
4605563 adoraria compor para homem de ferro no cinema como na m sica h obras boas e m s e a verdade que h filmes de her is como homem de ferro ou hellboy que s o sucessos mas que t m subst ncia

4605581 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements

4605588 we had near flawless execution across all four business areas
4605589 were executing very well on our current contracts and winning new strategic programs
4605590 they went through a strong surge of f 16 deliveries but it is definitely ramping down as it is being replaced gradually by the f 35
4605591 its not going away but it is going to be eclipsed by the f 35
4605592 do you think their company is going to admit it if it threatens their contract
4605593 people are starting to get a little stressed out theyre working a lot of hours theyre you know basically its just a lot of cleanup a lot of mud pushing shoveling getting the mud off
4605594 you know had one of the guys came in and said oh do you have insurance and yeah its out of pocket
4605595 we had today off as a vacation day to go riding go do some camping and get out of town because we were due
4605596 but i guess were going to stay home and try to get everything picked up
4605597 theres no way to know what was in the water tetanus is in the soil naturally so and especially if they had had an open cut or anything like that that they could have been exposed to thats one of the reasons were using that precaution
4605598 we need the dry weather to continue our cleanup efforts we cant afford to have another storm thats for sure
4605599 there are just so many cases i cant handle them all
4605600 the eastern district judges who hear patent cases are able to do only between 65 and 75 markman hearings a year substantially fewer than the number of suits filed annually
4605601 its hard to say to a client you ought to go elsewhere
4605602 generally i assume theyre going to want to go to one of the quicker venues
4605603 but to my surprise they prefer to go to marshall where the judges have the expertise
4605604 enquanto est vamos dan ando meu paquera e eu trocamos o primeiro beijo eu disse a ele que n o beijava no primeiro encontro e ele disse que n o costumava jogar seguindo regras
4605605 infringir os direitos autorais de propriedade intelectual apesar de a jackson parecer um an tema maldi o que mccain tenha utilizado sua can o

4605607 i am writing to commend you for your 25 years of loyal service to community board 10 as a dedicated and passionate civic leader your commitment to serving your community throughout the years is simply unparalleled as a former member of the board i have seen that your commitment to the community has transcended partisan lines in which you have freely offered a lending hand to both democrats and republicans
4605608 at the end of the day you are the community boards loss and someone elses gain
4605609 26 of respondents in 2007 felt that social media is
4605610 walk together talk together o ye peoples of the earth for then and only then will you have peace
4605611 at the annual triple a summit in boulder ill be there sunday which is another reason that you should listen to the station instead of that commercial radio crap
4605612 well i started playing piano in fourth grade so about 11 years ago i started three years ago is when i actually started taking it very seriously and getting involved in the industry
4605613 yeah id say so id say four or five years ago it was in the back of my head that it was something i wanted to do but it was three years ago when i started writing music and recording it that it didnt seem as much of a far fetched dream and more of a hard earned reality to work towards
4605614 well id say the ozzy tribute album that came out after the passing of randy rhoads
4605615 what is this and why have i not seen this before
4605616 my mouth dropped and i knew from that moment there was no turning back to the top 40 radio
4605617 i would say after going through and listening to so many glam bands as clich as it will sound i would have to go with eddie van halen
4605618 i just really respect a musician that does not compromise anything i mean the guy couldnt find what he wanted in a store bought guitar so he ended up making his own guitars to get everything right that is until kramer nabbed him and started making the guitars for him a lot of people when they think about eddie they think about his finger tapping technique or striped guitars but there is so much more to him than that he knew what he wanted in his gear and he did it himself he modified his amps built his guitars from spare parts and with what few effects he used he modified the circuitry to them too you dont see that nowadays now musicians will mostly just use whatever they get from guitar center and make it work for them but eddie refused to compromise cause he couldnt buy something the way he wanted it to be so i would definitely say eddie or randy rhoads would be my hero
4605619 i thought it was a really neat instrument and it seemed natural to go from piano to guitar
4605620 my first girlfriend kim back in 2003 was killed by a drunk driver a week before i turned 16 also she got me into wearing stars and nautical stars as a fashion statement she is why the focus of my logo is the star second my father passed away 6 months later on when i was 16 on a lighter note minarik guitars was my first sponsor and i received the inferno mirrorball from them and it was serial number 16 a few months later i purchased a lotus from them my eye was on 2 but they had sold it before i could get it so the next lowest one they were able to get me was again lucky number 16 all these events in my past have formed me into who i am that is why it is my logo and also why i have it tattooed on my arm
4605621 probably motley crue they have great stage presence and musical ability not to mention they put on one hell of a show
4605622 motley crue it would have to be live wire or on with the show
4605623 id say musically it would have to be the trans siberian orchestra i saw them at garden and it inspired me immensely they are all class act musicians
4605624 five years i will have graduated college and hopefully be touring the nation or the world with a band
4605625 nah when it comes to dreams you gotta have the highest hopes with the most reasonable expectations that is the perfect dream right there
4605626 perdoando nossos irm os estaremos ao mesmo tempo sendo perdoados por deus e agindo como ele
4605627 senhor quantas vezes devo perdoar se meu irm o pecar contra mim at sete vezes
4605628 n o ti digo at sete vezes mas at setenta vezes sete porque o reino dos c us como um patr o que resolveu acertar as contas com os seus empregados quando come ou o acerto trouxeram lhe um empregado que lhe devia uma enorme fortuna como o empregado n o tinha com que pagar o patr o mandou que ele fosse vendido como escravo junto com a mulher e os filhos e tudo o que possu a para que pagasse a d vida o empregado por m caiu aos p s do patr o e prostrado de joelhos suplicava d me um prazo e eu ti pagarei tudo diante disso o patr o teve compaix o pena soltou o empregado e perdoou lhe a d vida ao sair dali aquele empregado encontrou um dos seus companheiros que lhe devia apenas cem moedas ele o agarrou e come ou a sufoc lo dizendo paga o que me deves o companheiro caindo aos seus p s suplicava d me um prazo e eu ti pagarei mas o empregado n o quis saber disso saiu e mandou jog lo na pris o at que pagasse o que devia vendo o que havia acontecido os outros empregados ficaram muito tristes procuraram o patr o e lhe contaram tudo ent o o patr o mandou cham lo e lhe disse empregado perverso e ingrato eu ti perdoei toda a tua d vida porque tu me suplicaste n o devias tu tamb m ter compaix o do teu companheiro como eu tive compaix o de ti o patr o indignou se e mandou entregar aquele empregado aos torturadores at que pagasse toda a sua d vida assim que o meu pai que est s nos c us far convosco se cada um n o perdoar de cora o ao seu irm o

4605653 in the far future i imagine the possibility to search and schedule recordings this is not that important to me as mythweb really does a good job
4605654 apple tops google and teve job hordes it all teve job has done nothing philanthropic neither has scott mcnealy whereas gates brin lazaridis ellison all have donated significant amounts to really change the world he doesnt make the forbes list of philanthropists theres a new evil empire in town proprietary buggy apple
4605655 were putting improvements in place that are going to be effective in keeping our programs on track with cost and schedule
4605656 this undisciplined approach to program management and towards the maintenance of the evms will ultimately jeopardize the long term stability
4605657 raight now dis is yer cock riiight and when it gets a bit funny yer put it in the lady eh if youd like to come and demonstrate for me thass right jus put it in yer mouth eh blimey wahey
4605658 i am a big believer in the exploration and commercial development of the space frontier and am looking forward to the possibility of going into space
4605659 its like we chartered an airplane only in this case it was a rocket
4605660 theres nothing we love more than ambitious research with world changing potential and space exploration and research have long produced much of the scientific communitys most ambitious even audacious work
4605661 im hopeful that the private sector will achieve this long sought goal

4605687 how would you like it if you had balls in your ears
4605688 did not consent to many of the depicted sexual acts and that she was coerced to perform by her abusive husband
4605689 virtually every time someone watches that movie theyre watching me being raped
4605690 its not the air im breathing its my life escaping
4605691 awesome set of stories for the icing shots i think the next step is to mix the frosting into pancake syrup so you can
4605692 the number of people killed on our roadway each year as a result of dui related crashes is enough to fill at least one new cemetery annually
4605693 we have arrested every stereotype from the town drunk to the soccer mom
4605694 my son made several poor choices the night of his collision i believe that through his death other lives can be saved
4605695 the final consequences to many drinking and driving accidents are resulted here in the cemetery its something we see too much
4605696 dont think i would have an enemy that would do anything like this ive tried to be nice to people and i dont have the slightest idea
4605697 all three fires are showing a definite similarity as to how they occurred and how they started and we have reason to believe they are all related to each other
4605698 i hope to get it fixed up before i die
4605699 the state is ready to implement the sixth pay commission
4605700 the details have to be worked out with the ministry of finance
4605701 a trance like state that resembles sleep but is induced by a person whose suggestions are readily accepted by the subject
4605702 the circumstances surrounding his death are not considered suspicious and the matter has now been referred to the coroner
4605703 police would like to thank the community for their assistance in this matter
4605704 its my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it under new coach ross dallow to be honest with you i had a ball out there its exciting a 91 000 capacity crowd
4605705 regardless of whether you guys write me or or whatever you did that last year and it not only disappointed myself but my family
4605706 but i tell you i came back and im looking forward to next year you cant take this moment away from me no matter how much you write it off
4605707 i want to be back and be ready for next years final

4605713 mom look at this put your fingers around the top have you ever seen anything like it
4605714 every time i looked at the board i was trying to keep up closer
4605715 after making birdie i was still four behind im happy to be within shouting distance
4605716 obviously im pleased with the round but weve still got 36 holes
4605717 theres such a long way to go one shot can put an end to anything so what ive learned over the years is to play the game and see what happens
4605718 we get on the 18th tee and a friend of mine said man if you birdie this youll shoot 59 and everybody else was like i cant believe you said that it was just a social game of golf but it was fun
4605719 i should have played a pitch kind of safe out to the right and got it to about 15 feet but i felt i had momentum with me
4605720 a woman has been shot shes laying in the front yard
4605721 she ran out screaming call 9 1 1 shes now collapsed in the front yard saying the owner of the house shot her
4605722 the owner of the house does own multiple guns shes kind of considered the eccentric lady in the neighborhood
4605723 just hang in there theyre coming theyll be here any minute
4605724 they deserve the best and theyre going to get the best
4605725 i think if this school was being planned today it probably would not happen
4605726 yes we had a school that may have been on the books but do we really need that school at this point
4605727 the bottom line is student achievement and come monday thats what everyone is focused on
4605728 you always want to do something to make your skin look nice as you age
4605729 with the state of the economy right now and disposable income in general not everybody can afford to be putting 500 1 000 every three to four months
4605730 theyre really under no pressure to come back or return but many of the procedures like tattoo removal takes many sessions to complete the job
4605731 its fun its nice especially if you got the vip cosmetic card
4605732 the dark knight video game why it has to be good
4605733 their know how their experience their ability in co ordinating in kosovo i expect will make a real difference
4605734 there are different levels of personnel contribution from different countries this specific request was made and we responded
4605735 no vamos a ser flexibles con los causantes de da os ambientales en la capital al pagar esta sanci n coca cola deber dar cumplimiento a las obligaciones contra das con la entidad y acatar las normas ambientales vigentes
4605736 coca cola no cuenta con permiso de vertimientos desde el 24 de julio de 2006 fecha en la que caduc el t rmino establecido en la resoluci n 984 de 2001 mediante la cual se otorg el permiso de vertimientos
4605737 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4605738 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4605739 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4605740 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4605741 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4605742 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4605743 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4605744 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4605745 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4605746 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
4605747 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true
4605748 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4605749 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4605750 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4605751 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4605752 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4605753 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4605754 we are not against general musharraf as a person but we are against the dictators who have subverted the constitution of pakistan they should be made to stand trial
4605755 if the courts find any evidence against him it is for them to decide if the penalty will be death or a life sentence
4605756 he will remain the center of a lot of political attention a lot of anger a lot of resentment and possibly even some revenge
4605757 if he stays it wont be the life of a normal citizen
4605758 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4605759 to compete with the french we knew wed have to change something somewhere and jason kenny is such an amazing young talent
4605760 weve done a bunch of trials since the worlds and he pretty much earned his spot
4605761 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4605762 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4605763 has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4605764 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hardworking patriotic americans who call hawaii home
4605765 for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother and for him and his family to bond and recharge in his home state hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
4605766 i would resent anyone suggesting that my roots are not american
4605767 if he obama had gone someplace else people would be asking why didnt he go home to hawaii why didnt he go see his grandma
4605768 her home is a couple of blocks from the hospital he was born in from the school he went to honolulu is a little town its not some sort of exotic locality
4605769 aside from the fact that sen obama was born and raised here he really is just one of the millions of americans who choose to vacation in the islands and know that its part of the united states thats one of the advantages no passport is required and a dollar is dollar here sen obama or anyone else can do business worldwide 24 7 while in honolulu
4605770 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
4605771 after nprs cokie roberts suggested hawaii was an odd choice for barack obamas vacation
4605772 donald barella writes to say last i looked hawaii is one of the 50 states not a foreign place
4605773 it would have been devastating to everyone here if he had not done that
4605774 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4605775 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
4605776 i dont think anyone can credibly criticize senator obama for going back to the place where he was born to visit his grandmother where she happens to live
4605777 voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time
4605778 cri has a track record of providing significant value to the air force and other government agencies as a prime contractor
4605779 as part of the current contracts with the air force cri has performed significant and substantive work in applied research and development for new systems and capabilities
4605780 there is confusion about the terminology and i think there is confusion about how the process works
4605781 by the same token management always has had a certain amount of flexibility on the bonus side how much do you put in and that hasnt changed i dont think people realized those were management decisions prior to nsps some people did but a lot didnt
4605782 any change is difficult and unfortunately many leaders still dont pay enough attention to that human side of the change process
4605783 it is not unusual to find some of them approach it as a one and done in other words we ran up to this we did the training we had to do we trained and we implemented and therefore it is and it is all done and i dont have to continue to pay a lot of attention
4605784 the exception but even if weve got a handful of them not paying attention it is problematic
4605785 has led the most significant transformation of the civil service in a generation
4605786 would i have liked to see more agencies brought in faster yes
4605787 these are the same kinds of warning signs that occurred on the shuttles before the columbia accident but were ignored
4605788 were asking a lot of the russians a doubling of their soyuz production and we may well be overstraining their capacity
4605789 this is very worrisome and makes it all the more important to get new american spacecraft ready to fly sooner than 2015
4605790 please let me know if you have any specific points you want covered or that you would prefer to downplay
4605791 highly educated experienced in their field to suggest they could be puppets of the defense department is a little insulting to all of them not all of them are advocates for everything the department is doing
4605792 who have access to and know what the thinking of the pentagon is that makes them valuable to us
4605793 its a little unrealistic to think youre going to do a big background check on everybody
4605794 some of the business ties arent necessarily relevant when youre asking them about a specific helicopter operation
4605795 it completely destroyed the companys operations in a financial sense and in an employee sense
4605796 not engage in or tolerate discrimination in any form and rigorously follows the highest standards of business ethics
4605797 we are extremely disappointed and strongly disagree with the verdict in this contractual dispute
4605798 ik had verwacht dat de prijs met 15 zou stijgen door de situatie in georgie maar dat gebeurde niet
4605799 nous avons commenc notre tude en voulant v rifier que lexposition pr coce aux chats et chiens augmentait le risque dallergie et les donn es ne sont pas all es dans le sens que nous pensions en fait elles ont montr exactement le contraire

4605804 t mobile sent me the text of a lawsuit they filed yesterday against starbucks
4605805 i dont like the color blue therefore no more blue glass buildings in grand rapids ever
4605806 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4605807 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4605808 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4605809 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4605810 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4605811 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4605812 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4605813 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4605814 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4605815 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4605816 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4605817 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4605818 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4605819 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4605820 i had grease on my hands but i did this from my heart
4605821 a spirit of advocacy to a sp a bus with an advertisement for gap in singapore
4605822 we were not looking for bigfoot we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
4605823 i didnt believe in bigfoot at the time but youve got to come to terms with it and realize youve got something special and thats what it was
4605824 it seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax
4605825 we still have a corpse we just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend
4605826 ill tell you what ive seen and what ive touched and what ive felt what ive prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide ok
4605827 many couples approach us for gender selection but we do not entertain them many of these desperate parents then fly out of the country
4605828 weve never looked at how all the unique things this government wages against others could be used to inform our defensive posture
4605829 we really need to move from the reality that the advantage is always with the attacker to how we can have our offense better inform our defense to shrink that gap
4605830 this an important and perhaps one of the most important national security and economic security issues facing us today
4605831 we want a broader information flow to the private sector of the threats were seeing so that they can increase their security posture as well
4605832 this is the oldest conflict in security because if we give away our best exploits we lose the ability to use them offensively
4605833 thats a conflict the guys at nsa deal with every day when you find good ones how long do you wait before you tell the vendors and people defending our own networks
4605834 we lost a key exploit for a critical hard target so there was a gain and there was a loss
4605835 many of us agree that were going to have to accept a lot more intelligence losses in order to increase the defensive posture of the nation
4605836 to my mind one of the key tests of whether this program will be successful or not is how much information falls on the classified side of the line and how much falls on the unclassified side
4605837 the more information that gets classified the less likely the initiative will succeed
4605838 what youre seeing here is the acknowledgment by the administration that dhs had its chance flubbed it and now weve got to get serious
4605839 the world has changed pretty dramatically so we wanted to do something that would put emphasis on rewarding superior performance
4605840 now there will be some concerns there always are concerns
4605841 but basically think of it as a merit based system that rewards high performers it has the flavor of the private sector in that you get superior performance one of the ways it is often described is that you get the behavior that you reward so that is the way we are thinking of this
4605842 the control putin is building over the countrys corporate sector resembles the kind of fascism instituted by italian dictator benito mussolini or spains francisco franco
4605843 i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key that key is russian national interest
4605844 with the hard work and investment these players made in the spring they will want to continue its getting into game mode as quickly as possible to get a handle on things
4605845 were going to hit the road running immediately through training organizing and playing
4605846 we will then re evaluate on monday whatever it is we need to do in terms of fitness
4605847 the control putin is building over the countrys corporate sector resembles the kind of fascism instituted by italian dictator benito mussolini or spains francisco franco
4605848 i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key that key is russian national interest
4605849 the control putin is building over the countrys corporate sector resembles the kind of fascism instituted by italian dictator benito mussolini or spains francisco franco
4605850 i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key that key is russian national interest
4605851 the control putin is building over the countrys corporate sector resembles the kind of fascism instituted by italian dictator benito mussolini or spains francisco franco
4605852 i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key that key is russian national interest
4605853 to determine the feasibility of changing all current fleets of trucks buses forklifts and heavy equipment to run on natural gas
4605854 in addition well have some non roster players as well
4605855 the size of the price increase is the real surprise
4605856 we continue to think the disappointments are a product of under investment
4605857 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4605858 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated
4605859 therefore we continue to expect that earnings per share diluted from operations in 2009 will increase however at a rate below our long term objective of 6 percent to 8 percent growth
4605860 i dont like the color blue therefore no more blue glass buildings in grand rapids ever
4605861 still reeling from the heat in columbia the conventioneer said it would be his last time in this famously hot city
4605862 oh that lady can help me you can go i am ok
4605863 well you are growing up and i am so proud of who god is growing you up to be
4605864 its ok mama i will always be your baby i just wont look like one
4605865 father i have just now told you its a crow
4605866 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times
4605867 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow perched in the window
4605868 the worst of the eight hells is called continuous hell it has the meaning of continuous suffering thus the name
4605869 el peor de los ocho infiernos se llama infierno continuo porque es de continuo sufrimiento por eso el nombre
4605870 il peggiore degli otto inferni chiamato inferno continuo perch di continua sofferenza da questo il nome
4605871 a prova perfeita e bater na frente dos advers rios
4605872 se todos marcarem melhores tempos no s bado de nada vai adiantar ter batido o recorde vou cair na piscina para fazer a prova perfeita e bater na frente dos advers rios sem me preocupar com o tempo
4605873 no longer the place to learn docile obedience and respect for hierarchy
4605874 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth
4605875 im still amazed that we can actually manage to prove that
4605876 its kind of depressing when people cant communicate with each other
4605877 we know thats true in politics but youd think that wouldnt be going on here
4605878 thats something i bet im going to run into down the line i want to bookmark that
4605879 and replacing old man anakin sebastian shaw with hayden christensens young anakin felt right
4605880 i wont ever release the original star wars on dvd
4605881 dont do the crime if you cant do the time
4605882 what the demo gods know that smart entrepreneurs should learn
4605883 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
4605884 what the demo gods know that smart entrepreneurs should learn
4605885 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
4605886 a lot of these things require a little adult supervision from the justice department or congress which will resolve a lot of the food fights these two agencies find themselves in
4605887 have in their hearts the safety and security of this country
4605888 where the ball got dropped and its not going to matter whose fault it was because information wasnt passed or shared
4605889 we thought wed get more cooperation from two agencies that ought to be cooperating in the war on terror
4605890 one day you wake up and atf is part of justice
4605891 as mrap revenues trend down theyve got the stryker armored vehicle and the abrams tank at production rates that are on the rise and theyll sustain their growth in combat systems
4605892 each business segment improved margins significantly by almost any measure this was a great quarter given the strong start of this quarter it is apparent to me that the original guidance was conservative
4605893 the review has determined that the citation is considered valid
4605894 i really dig being a meter maid i work outside its a steady gig with the city theyre cool with my pts
4605895 um excuse me but ees thees uh uh ees thees a gay bar
4605896 jessica jessica simpson yes im talking to you if you read these words please heed my advice step away from the daisy dukes forget you ever saw a pair or played their namesake in a god awful movie they are tacky my dear and not very fashion forward
4605897 es un punto de inflexi n en la pol tica de alemania y es hist rico con esto la industria de los videojuegos queda definitivamente incluida en el mbito cultural
4605898 its good when the manager speaks highly of you but i know we have a lot of quality midfielders
4605899 if i can get in it would be great but i will just concentrate on motherwell and doing well here
4605900 it has all been a good experience and i would love to play for my country
4605901 we were poor on monday but if i were to throw out the lads who did not do well then we would be left with about four players
4605902 there may be one or two but they will have more to do with my approach to the celtic game than anything else
4605903 we have had a very frank discussion about how we can improve and i believe we can be better on sunday
4605904 these lads have done well for me since i came here and there were others who were making their debuts
4605905 we didnt really get the flowing football that we normally get but we will get better as the weeks go on
4605906 at least this is a match that will see us refocus pretty quickly as our concentration level cant be anything less than 100 percent
4605907 wow i love your makeup today it looks really natural
4605908 legally i cant let you go home but i can let you out of my sight and where you go after that is your choice
4605909 infringir os direitos autorais de propriedade intelectual apesar de a jackson parecer um an tema maldi o que mccain tenha utilizado sua can o

4605911 haver tempo e espa o para abordar as repercuss es
4605912 maintains that the events of 9 11 were engineered by a rogue network of the military industrial complex
4605913 i think hes exceptional ive said before if you speak to the likes of steven gerrard and the lads who play in midfield theyll tell you that if theres a forward making movements it makes their job a little bit easier
4605914 hes obviously a very good finisher but to be classed as a great forward i think youre movement has got to be up there i think his is first class
4605915 you look at robbie keanes record over the last few years at tottenham and his has been great as well
4605916 he not only scored goals but hes created them as well hes obviously a player who can create goals out of nothing really
4605917 the fact is that fernando is quick his movements very good and hopefully robbie keane can supply him on paper it looks a fantastic partnership so i hope it definitely works
4605918 im speaking purely from a fans point of view here
4605919 i want him to stay for as long as hes happy and as long as he keeps scoring goals and it helps liverpool to win things
4605920 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4605921 as a coach you always want three points of course and we were well on the way but overall i think it was a fair result
4605922 in the situation we are in with a lot of young players and the late arrival of so many players who were involved in euro 2008 then i think we have to be happy
4605923 the opening spell was almost paradoxical because we should have scored at the start and then straight away we were a goal down from a move that began with a throw in
4605924 it was the worst possible scenario especially when youre playing away at bayern munich so to come back from that and get a point youre always going to be happy
4605925 its just a lot of fun like it was with the national team theres a lot of adrenaline but as a coach you dont want anything different
4605926 its hard to compare the feeling at this arena with anything because its one of the best in the world
4605927 there are perhaps a few like it in england such as manchester uniteds but we coaches love the pressure anyway otherwise we wouldnt do the job
4605928 the fact that 10 member unions have signaled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4605929 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signaling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4605930 australia england ireland italy japan scotland south africa and wales have confirmed an interest in hosting rugby world cup 2015 while australia ireland italy jamaica japan russia scotland south africa and wales submitted expressions of interest in tendering for the 2019 tournament lapasset said
4605931 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4605932 a group of world citizens sharing a common concern for the future of humanity
4605933 n s n o vimos seu gato n o me pergunte de novo
4605934 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4605935 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4605936 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4605937 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4605938 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4605939 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4605940 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4605941 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4605942 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4605943 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4605944 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4605945 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4605946 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4605947 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4605948 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4605949 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4605950 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4605951 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4605952 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4605953 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4605954 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4605955 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4605956 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4605957 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4605958 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4605959 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4605960 de tekst in de folder is wel correct en dat is toch het belangrijkste
4605961 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4605962 this is a planning took where all things are going
4605963 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4605964 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4605965 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4605966 in spet naslednji dan mi o kemiji ki da jo je e vedno utiti ne glede na razplet govorijo popolnoma druga na usta
4605967 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4605968 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4605969 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4605970 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4605971 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4605972 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4605973 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4605974 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4605975 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4605976 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4605977 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4605978 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4605979 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4605980 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4605981 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4605982 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4605983 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4605984 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4605985 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4605986 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4605987 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4605988 all of my favorite rap albums are cds i bought on the street
4605989 i mean i like some commercial rap i like some underground hip hop but the shit i really get down with is downright subterranean i love the murky production values i find it exquisite when someone rhymes a word with the same word but its not the campiness that captivates me its the urgent sincerity the flares of emotion the specificities of small but stinging daily struggles inside the odd sparse beats and untreated vocals i can imagine the scene where the music was recorded three teenagers in a makeshift basement studio joined perhaps by a couple of younger siblings one looking on watchfully the other tugging at pant legs demanding a turn with the mic i dont want my rappers driving escalades i want them begging rides from their friends or driving the same beat up piece of shit as me
4605990 were hoping that our purchases along with some other retailers will help bring the technology costs down
4605991 i had the choice of rangers and celtic and it was a hard decision to make
4605992 but the chance to play in the champions league was what swung it for me
4605993 i was flattered by rangers interest but the chance to play in europe was just too good to turn down
4605994 we were unfortunate last season at the time we scored at motherwell we were in the ascendency and i did not think they would have got back into the game
4605995 if barrys goal was given along with zander diamonds disallowed effort at celtic park a few weeks earlier then who knows
4605996 it is a difficult game for us as motherwell were a bit of a bogey team for us last season
4605997 a lot of the teams who did well last season the likes of falkirk motherwell dundee united and ourselves all lost on the opening day despite high expectations
4605998 all of the sides who are vying to force their way into the top six got beat but that is football for you

4606019 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4606020 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4606021 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4606022 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4606023 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4606024 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4606025 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4606026 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4606027 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4606028 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4606029 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4606030 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4606031 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4606032 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4606033 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4606034 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4606035 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4606036 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4606037 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4606038 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4606039 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4606040 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4606041 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4606042 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4606043 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4606044 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4606045 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4606046 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4606047 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4606048 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4606049 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4606050 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4606051 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4606052 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4606053 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4606054 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4606055 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4606056 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4606057 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4606058 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4606059 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4606060 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4606061 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4606062 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4606063 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4606064 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4606065 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4606066 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4606067 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4606068 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4606069 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4606070 these are elite commandos trained specifically to engage and neutralize terrorists on friday they were led by an ips officer who was himself dressed like that
4606071 even the bulletproof vests they wear are not ordinary ones these vests can withstand firing from an ak rifle from point blank range they are also trained to use the lethal 9mm uzi sub machine guns
4606072 each one of them is armed with enough ammunition to engage terrorists for a long time the ammunition is strapped around the waist
4606073 senior government officials do not want cat to have power of contempt it is uncomfortable for them last year the proposal to remove it had come to the standing committee but we rejected it
4606074 an empirical study should be made as to in how many cases the interim or final orders of the cat have not been implemented except when contempt cases have been filed
4606075 around 38 of all new infections are occurring among women the pilot phase where we distributed 5 lakh female condoms proved to be a huge success we now plan to intensify our campaign for female condoms in 2001 we had 900 000 general condom outlets by 2010 we will have 3 million
4606076 female condoms have proved effective especially for home based sex work but not so much for street based prostitution we are working on a proposal to make available female condoms at just rs 3 we are buying it for around rs 23
4606077 till very recently we were buying the condoms for rs 40 and making it available to women for rs 5

4606247 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage

4606279 because running on empty is so famously associated with jackson browne essentially whats been misappropriated here is jacksons identity
4606280 theyve put it in a commercial in a way that says that jackson browne is supporting senator mccain
4606281 is you have an expert witness from the music publishing world talking about had jackson browne granted permission what would the license fee have been given his stature the famousness of the song and the use of it in this case jackson doesnt give permission for commercials which means the value had he done it would have been very high
4606282 the ohio republican party prepared the ad as an agent for and in concert with the national party and john mccain
4606283 ohio as you know is a key battleground state in the election and google lists plenty of examples of the close relationship between the national party and the ohio party our information and belief is that none of the state parties are sending stuff out that has not been approved by the national campaign and particularly in a key battleground state its inconceivable to us that this ad was done without the knowledge and consent of the mccain campaign
4606284 but i dont believe for a second that barack obamas campaign would have taken a jackson browne song and used it without his permission jackson has played concerts for barack obama they know each other
4606285 y prepared the ad as an agent for and in concert with the national party and john mccain
4606286 jackson has played concerts for barack obama they know each other

4606340 that his allegations in his complaint make it possible for him to immediately get a preliminary injunction declaring a foreclosure moratorium on all fraudulently induced mortgages
4606341 is that it is not being treated as an emergency problem by the attorney general or bank of america
4606342 the pressure on the attorney general to seek the same would be overwhelming the ag would be forced by the legislature to take action immediately moreover citizen groups could file that the ag take action

4606453 italian and irish immigrants were discriminated against too you dont see them still complaining like black people
4606454 africans held slaves too and slavery used to exist in eastern europe as well
4606455 white people got lynched in the west just like black people got lynched in the south so why is talking about lynching somebody such a big deal
4606456 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
4606457 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
4606458 i dont know i just dont get it whats the big deal
4606459 the apartment house tenant must have the freedom to lean out of his window and as far as his arms can reach transform the exterior of his dwelling space and he must be allowed to take a long brush and as far as his arms can reach paint everything pink so that from far away from the street everyone can see there lives a man who distinguishes himself from his neighbours the pent up livestock he must also be allowed to cut up the walls and make all kinds of changes even if this disturbs the architectural harmony of a so called masterwork and he must be able to fill his room with mud or childrens modelling clay
4606460 today we live in a chaos of straight lines in a jungle of straight lines if you do not believe this take the trouble to count the straight lines which surround you then you will understand for you will never finish counting
4606461 this jungle of straight lines which is entangling us more and more like inmates in a prison must be cleared until now man has always cleared away the jungles he was in and freed himself but to clear a jungle you must first become aware that you are in one for this jungle took form stealthily unnoticed by mankind and this time it is a jungle of straight lines
4606462 when man thinks he has to correct nature it is an irreparable mistake every time a community should not consider it an honour how much spontaneous vegetation it destroys it should rather be a point of honour for every community to protect as much of its natural landscape as possible

4606483 over the past 10 years jamie has played a critical role in growing loud technologies into the industry leader that it is today we appreciate his contributions and wish him the best
4606484 we are fortunate to have a strong successor to take over the reins and continue our growth efforts
4606485 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4606486 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4606487 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4606488 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4606489 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4606490 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4606491 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4606492 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4606493 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4606494 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite

4606504 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
4606505 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
4606506 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
4606507 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio
4606508 it is hard to tell if the water scheme is the device being used to seize the land or if the wind turbine scheme is the means by which he will fund the water scheme

4606517 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4606518 the ans remains a unique apparatus available to only a limited circle of musicians the single experimental model of the device in existence currently belongs to moscow state university where a general lack of space and technical support have prevented a widening of the circle of ans users although the ans has not achieved widespread fame the idea of directly transforming graphic structures into sound structures has not lost its relevance and can now be used successfully in computer music
4606519 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4606520 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4606521 both riches and honor come from you and you reign over all
4606522 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ
4606523 the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful
4606524 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon
4606525 or do you despise the riches of his goodness forbearance and long suffering not knowing that the goodness of god leads you to repentance
4606526 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had prepared beforehand for glory even us whom he called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles
4606527 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
4606528 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out
4606529 that you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
4606530 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might through his spirit in the inner man
4606531 and my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
4606532 come now you rich weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth eaten your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have heaped up treasure in the last days
4606533 for in one hour such great riches came to nothing
4606534 but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as he is also mediator of a better covenant which was established on better promises

4606587 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
4606588 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
4606589 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella grear said
4606590 maybe this will be another motivator to either keep people active or motivate them to become active if theyre not
4606591 this is a questionable concept since we do not know the strength of the direction or association between physical health and mental function
4606592 here is when we ask which comes first the egg or the chicken
4606593 by being able to detect the fact that theyre on the path to dementia i think well be able in the future to target better therapies that might prevent the onset of dementia or potentially to prepare the ground for the person in the family to face the disease
4606594 so if you can improve that element of the way our bodies work which is what physical fitness does youre going to be also protecting the brain from cognitive decline
4606595 and conversely if you can maintain your brain function by exercising it you may also be improving your ability to stay physically active
4606596 whats known is that people who exercise are less likely to get dementia but people who exercise might be different in other ways
4606597 its surreal its like a horror movie or when you wake up from a really bad dream

4606634 howard bach and bob malaythong the lone usa badminton athletes remaining in the 2008 olympic games dropped their quarterfinal match to the chinese team of yun cai and haifeng fu two sets to none by scores of 21 9 and 21 10 despite the loss the duo made history for the u s by advancing farther in an olympic badminton tournament than any previous american
4606635 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking
4606636 there is one focus and it is that this matter must be resolved
4606637 i believe we can protect the city until the river reaches 14m but i cant say what will happen if the water level exceeds 14m
4606638 we will keep a close eye on the situation and monitor information from forecasters closely
4606639 we cant manage and release water if the level of the mekong is too high
4606640 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far police inspector cornelius charles said
4606641 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4606642 theres a fine line in saying something that is offensive to the guy sitting next to you
4606643 ask yourself if youd want your 10 year old son exposed to that sort of language
4606644 dont worry theres no provisions in there for standing if someone wants to stand up the whole time they are certainly free to do so

4606672 unfortunately this city commission does not understand the consequences of working against tbc texas border coalition valley interfaith nature preserves and everyone eleses efforts to stop the border wall construction all of the border cities throughout are united with tbc and are fighting on brownsvilles behalf but our commissioners unwillingness to stand united against the federal government undermines all who oppose the wall
4606673 on behalf of the board i would like to express our sincere appreciation to the many individuals who worked so diligently to find a compromise outcome that would satisfy the responsibilities of both ut brownsville texas southmost college and the u s department of homeland security related to the construction of the proposed border fence
4606674 this plan will allow dhs cbp to carry out their mission and the university to preserve the educational and historic nature of the campus

4606683 star wars from a man who cares little about established continuity its star wars that takes place in a time period already over crouded sic with conflicting stories and source materials i understand that lucas wanted to continue the story into television but jesus christ couldnt he have picked a point in the saga that wasnt filled with stories some of which he himself approved
4606684 we follow the adventures of anakin skywalker and obi wan kenobi as well as other jedi fighting to preserve the lofty ideals of the republic against count dooku and his cronies who are threatening to tear the galaxy apart
4606685 even though it was animated in a stylized cg form george made it very clear to director
4606686 hes an encyclopedia of star wars knowledge combining all the hundreds of comics dozens of novels and games too there is just so much in the expanded universe everything not in the movies it was great knowing leland was there to prevent any grave inconsistencies from coming to pass
4606687 were going to see another side to him in the movie when he was a champion of the republic and a great jedi hero so hes not the brooding petulant kid we knew from the movies but the best friend and comrade in arms of obi wan kenobi as well as a playful big brother like mentor to his new padawan ahsoka tano
4606688 a guy like that is indispensable in a galaxy that has grown as large as it has
4606689 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4606690 make sure that gen mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4606691 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4606692 we have tried that in the 1990s we dont want to go down that path again
4606693 we dont know if triumph international got the right information from their regional representatives
4606694 the company has followed required legal steps to dismiss the labour union leader
4606695 all we can do now is look after the protesting workers
4606696 both sides are standing firm with their positions it will be difficult to reach any agreement if the situation continues like this
4606697 if our leader is treated unfairly workers will be at a disadvantage and their basic rights could easily be violated by the employer in the future
4606698 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is

4606704 if in power would you favour measures to reverse this discrimination by giving unborn children who are disabled the same protection under the law as currently enjoyed by all other children
4606705 may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that
4606706 personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view
4606707 thecall is a fast not a festival thecall is a solemn assembly not a conference
4606708 there will be no advertised bands and no promoted speakers as our purpose is not to promote any man or ministry
4606709 we believe that our nation is in a critical hour and in desperate need of revival while our societys moral compass continues to erode the faith of our nation is becoming increasingly secularized
4606710 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4606711 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4606712 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4606713 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4606714 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4606715 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4606716 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4606717 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
4606718 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4606719 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4606720 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4606721 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4606722 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4606723 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4606724 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4606725 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4606726 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4606727 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4606728 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4606729 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4606730 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4606731 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4606732 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4606733 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4606734 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4606735 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4606736 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4606737 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4606738 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4606739 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4606740 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4606741 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4606742 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4606743 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4606744 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4606745 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4606746 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4606747 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4606748 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4606749 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4606750 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4606751 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

4606783 the most urgent priority for the u s military at this time is to save lives and alleviate suffering
4606784 during these humanitarian relief operations the united states expects russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4606785 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4606786 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4606787 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4606788 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will reexamine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4606789 there is an initial package that went in on two c 17s

4606794 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4606795 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had

4606806 the jurys use of the bible here amounts to a type of private communication contact or tampering that is outside the evidence and law
4606807 as oliver has not presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the state courts finding that the bible did not influence the jurys decision we cannot say that the jurys use of the bible had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict
4606808 but if he struck him down with an iron object so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
4606809 you could say god and moses anticipated this exact thing if you take a literal view of it
4606810 there is contradictory evidence regarding whether the jurors consultation of the bible occurred before or after the jury reached its decision
4606811 several jurors testified that the bible was not a focus of their discussions

4606821 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4606822 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4606823 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4606824 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4606825 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4606826 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4606827 blaming the victim for the aggression is not the right thing we chose to resist russia what else would any responsible democracy do it is very unfortunate what is happening here it is the worst nightmare of any president of any country can find themselves in

4606846 there are still major obstacles that have prevented adoption of this technology
4606847 lack of reimbursement the high cost of purchasing and installing the equipment and confusion surrounding the legality of providing patient care across state lines are among the most commonly cited reasons
4606848 the reports predicting that the practice of telemedicine will save the healthcare industry billions of dollars while vastly improving the quality of patient care may eventually prove to be prophetic before that happens however most experts agree there is going to have to be broader financial support from payers in both the private and public sectors
4606849 its not just stroke patients who are benefiting from telemedicine
4606850 overstretched state and local health authorities are making use of the technology to spread their resources further while avoiding having doctors spending long amounts of time on the road its not just for institutions as we reported recently intel is about to enter the market with a home telemedicine device the health guide if i have any concern over the growing use of telemedicine it is over matters peripheral to the actual doctor patient interaction instead the worries are infrastructural does rural america have the necessary bandwidth to support robodocs if not wouldnt it be in the public good to make sure they do

4606895 while we remain confident in the strength of our proposal it is clear that the initial analysis conducted in this process does not favor our approach
4606896 for that reason we have made a business decision to withdraw from the competition and to focus our efforts on our other projects in san diego

4606903 we want producers to know what they can do to prevent the disease what to look for and what to do if they suspect an infection
4606904 reporting the disease is the most important thing a producer can do to protect the industry
4606905 if other states lose confidence in our sheep theyll simply stop taking our animals
4606906 it is absolutely essential that producers report the disease so that it can be contained as quickly as possible
4606907 there are a variety of commercial products pending registration including pour on and spray on insecticides insecticide impregnated ear tags and vaccines to help prevent the spread of the virus from the host insect to sheep

4606920 the goals of the organization were to honour siegel and shuster during the 50th anniversary of superman to host a convention for that purpose to erect a superman statue honouring them and to create a siegel amp shuster museum of comics and science fiction it accomplished the first of two of those goals
4606921 in a nutshell i was approached by tony isabella to assist in a project to honour siegel and shuster on the occasion of a big shindig in their home town of cleveland tony also being a native of that city i talked a handful of my compatriots into contributing and supplied the overall framing device illustrating the first and last pages and a retro styled tribute of my own
4606922 as i remember it i had a call from dave who told me about the whole superman museum project
4606923 dave was acting editor so the pages were sent on to him luckily he had the foresight to photocopy the completed story before fed xing it off to the states and eventual oblivion on the plus side im an unashamed hoarder and kept my set of photocopies the job turned out pretty nifty for a quickie freebie
4606924 the most concise version of why the benefit tribute comic book wasnt completed and published was that neb went bust in rather spectacular fashion
4606925 i know i wrote the story for my portion of the job and paul neary inked it and i think emphasizing think absolutely not certain tony isabella originated the project as something to celebrate the impending anniversary and to be archived in some museum or other as a permanent tribute i we had done our work when it transpired that dc hadnt wouldnt give their approval and the whole thing fell through
4606926 nothing happened for a whole while there were grapevine rumblings about problems and then finally we heard that the project had collapsed contributed art had gone missing it was all a big bad tasting mess but not uncommon then or now good intentions are fine in theory but reality is a hard master
4606927 for whatever reasons the planned comic never materialized and the story was
4606928 as for the original art well it used to get stolen all the time from publishers so no surprise there 9 years later i had an entire thunder agents story boosted from the office and that pissed me off a hell of a lot more but id dearly love to know which slimy bastard swiped an entire charity job
4606929 i really dont know what happened to the original art for that

4606946 its a storytelling lens you can tell a whole story in one frame
4606947 you are getting the sweet spot and you are cropping out the edges
4606948 the trick is to use the foreground get very close to something and fill the foreground
4606949 lets say youre in munich and there is a juggler you get two to three feet away from him put him in the foreground and you can still see the towers of frauenkirche in the background
4606950 if you put someones head in the corner of a frame it becomes distorted you get the egghead thing so you have to be careful

4606957 when we asked them which teams were involved many of them got the wrong teams people got the wrong years and estimates in terms of the number of people involved varied widely from a couple thousand people in the park to 10 000
4606958 were guessing that no more than 200 or 300 people actually took part in the violence and there may have been a couple of thousand spectators
4606959 i just kept coming across novels and short stories that use the riot as a background and i was intrigued by the way it had entered the consciousness of the city
4606960 traumatic historical events like that they trouble you they trouble the writers and i was puzzled why there was no marker for an event like that

4606962 successfully used baseball to integrate into society and diffuse the fact that they were different than most canadians
4606963 it was a very different response than the one that came from their parents who were mostly immigrants dont make waves
4606964 which is why so many people claim to have been there even if they hadnt and why its so important
4606965 colonies by nature lack self awareness and a sense of their own past they believe that matters of note happen elsewhere
4606966 a very small event in the history of the world
4606967 nobody will ever think of it as a great canadian event
4606968 but in a way it was an expression of the multiculturalism that would be in the future

4607070 the biggest factor by far is poverty and lack of access to preventive services and treatment services
4607071 without health insurance you cant afford treatment a but you can afford treatment c but that will probably shorten your life
4607072 theyre constantly trading off and it never all comes together at the end of the month
4607073 even if you get a diagnosis what happens then whos going to pay for it
4607074 clearly theyre not reaching everybody and they dont have the resources to reach everybody
4607075 theyre overloaded when you think about the expense of treating cancer and the kind of time it takes
4607076 theres a safety net but the safety net isnt sufficient for the number of people who need to use it
4607077 i can say quite confidently that the vast majority of patients that are uninsured do not get the treatment that they need for cancer
4607078 great community minded physicians who want to help but they can only do so much
4607079 which patient this month can we refer to that physician
4607080 its affecting the middle class and thats often when issues get attention
4607081 why is it so slow it doesnt hurt enough people yet

4607087 not that it was good work anyway it was pretty much a mess
4607088 it sends a message its like if someone came up and cut up all my roses thats my property it doesnt belong to them

4607108 the voice of america voa broadcasting in languages including persian mandarin pashto and urdu will provide its international audience of an estimated 134 million with news analysis and interviews from the democratic and republican presidential nominating conventions voa www voanews com the largest u s international broadcaster is fielding a team of nearly 90 reporters technicians producers directors and coordinators to create a radio television and internet broadcast center at both conventions broadcasters from 26 of voas 45 language services are providing virtually round the clock coverage

4607117 went here ages ago for a delicious brunch want to return for lunch dinner
4607118 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
4607119 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
4607120 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
4607121 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
4607122 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
4607123 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
4607124 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
4607125 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
4607126 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
4607127 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
4607128 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
4607129 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
4607130 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound
4607131 and cautions against the over reliance on current technological systems
4607132 bob beck was a remarkable guy who ultimately changed the way we see things that are invisible to light
4607133 he provided much of the foundation for the detection and processing of radiologic signals his work still serves as the basis for the design for many modern systems
4607134 in many ways bob set the stage for the emergence of nuclear medicine
4607135 he brought much needed rigor to the field of imaging systems in those days you almost never saw an equation in the journal of nuclear medicine but one of bobs first papers had about 50
4607136 to this day many nuclear imaging systems are based on his ideas and calculations on how collimators the devices that select and screen the raw data for single photon images perform
4607137 from high school days bob was pointed to a career in physics
4607138 but he was deeply troubled by the moral issues raised by the role of physics in the atomic bomb project
4607139 his vision and passion for nuclear medicine and imaging science have inspired our own life long commitment to research in these areas
4607140 he taught and led by example and he set a fine one always thinking about others before worrying about himself

4607253 these are the sorrows and they are three in number as the graces are three who dress mans life with beauty the parcoe are three who weave the dark arras of mans life in their mysterious loom always with colours sad in part sometimes angry with tragic crimson and black the furies are three who visit with retribution called from the other side of the grave offences that walk upon this and once even the muses were but three who fit the harp the trumpet or the lute to the great burdens of mans impassioned creations these are the sorrows all three of whom i know
4607254 one of whom i know and the others too surely i shall know
4607255 lo here is he whom in childhood i dedicated to my altars this is he that once i made my darling him i led astray him i beguiled and from heaven i stole away his young heart to mine through me did he become idolatrous and through me it was by languishing desires that he worshipped the worm and prayed to the wormy grave holy was the grave to him lovely was its darkness saintly its corruption him this young idolater i have seasoned for thee dear gentle sister of sighs do thou take him now to thy heart and season him for our dreadful sister and thou
4607256 wicked sister that temptest and hatest do thou take him from her see that thy sceptre lie heavy on his head suffer not woman and her tenderness to sit near him in his darkness banish the frailties of hope wither the relenting of love scorch the fountain of tears curse him as only thou canst curse so shall he be accomplished in the furnace so shall he see the things that ought not to be seen sights that are abominable and secrets that are unutterable so shall he read elder truths sad truths grand truths fearful truths so shall he rise again before he dies and so shall our commission be accomplished which from god we had to plague his heart until we had unfolded the capacities of his spirit

4607296 they seemed to be nice neighbors nice and quiet didnt have a lot to say kept to themselves
4607297 its a relatively quiet street stable neighborhood in hindsight it looks like a great place to do what they were doing

4607300 our investigators did observe children at the daycare coinciding with the times that the buys were made
4607301 it means so much to our troops serving all over the world to see this kind of support coming from their communities
4607302 the military in a lot of ways is about community and local actions like this have a huge impact on morale
4607303 these are personal community based efforts and to have schools and young people taking part in them sends the message we this particular community we know what youre doing we know why youre doing it and were grateful
4607304 put my heart in a vise and didnt let go

4607307 yeah this is great and my great uncle was supposed to be a smuggler

4607310 and after the stutterings of george bush i feel he is just what america needs im not too concerned about alienating republicans because im pretty sure my audience is mostly democratic
4607311 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4607312 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4607313 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4607314 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4607315 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4607316 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic

4607324 this picture shows a cluster of stars that were formed recently maybe about a million years ago
4607325 the entire geode was a dense ball of gas and dust it collapsed under its own gravity to form the cluster of stars
4607326 an expanding blister may form in the direction with low densities or a stalled wall is formed in the direction with high densities
4607327 you might ask how come we are so lucky to be peering through the thinnest wall of this geode
4607328 well if we were looking at the geode in directions where thick walls exist we wouldnt be able to see the inside
4607329 the interesting thing about this geode is that along its dense wall there are dust pillars sticking out and young stars are being formed at the tips of these pillars we have obtained spitzer space telescope images of this region and find ir infrared sources at the tips of the pillars and the spectral properties of these ir sources suggest that they contain young stars that are still enshrouded in dust
4607330 as you can see the hst images show clearly the detail structure while the spitzer image is more fuzzy
4607331 this is because hsts resolution is over 10 times better than spitzer
4607332 i proposed to hubble to observe the superbubble n44 because it had x ray emissions and i wanted to use high resolution images to search for supernova remnant shocks
4607333 the observation was made but not properly made so i requested a make up observation at a slightly different location in n44 to allow an arbitrary roll angle of the space craft
4607334 you can say that i took advantage of the make up observation to sneak in this object
4607335 i have to say that i am a lucky astronomer
4607336 i try to pursue truth and beauty at the same time

4607373 people are concerned about whether theres a bailout thats going to be coming from the u s so it would be logical to see foreign investors pull out of agency paper
4607374 they dont know whether the u s is going to be committed to supporting the gses and if they are going to support them by what methods are they going to support them
4607375 most fixed income investors to whom we have spoken believe that a capital infusion by the government into freddie and fannie is a prerequisite for turning sentiment around in mortgage backed securities and by extension in the broader fixed income markets
4607376 the longer the debate drags on the more tentative foreign interest in the sector is likely to become even though the gses are adequately capitalized investor confidence has been shaken
4607377 a slowdown in international investor interest remains the major risk factor for agency spreads in our view
4607378 were likely to see renewed flows into treasuries and perhaps some high quality u s corporates
4607379 it would take something dramatic for there to be a material improvement in the confidence necessary to bring foreign investment back to these agencies at the levels weve become used to
4607380 there is the hope thats held out by some for a magic bullet and that could take the form of a sizable infusion of capital or perhaps a complete rethink of restructuring both of these gses
4607381 they marketed things to investors making specific representation about liquidity but failing to disclose to them that there were potential risks out there in the marketplace that might affect their ability to actually provide the liquidity they claimed was available
4607382 we have started with the largest firms and we are working our way down the list
4607383 no doubt you have many retail brokerage firms who sold securities our belief is those firms are also liable to the investors
4607384 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4607385 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4607386 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4607387 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4607388 we are constantly in motion trying find better ways of doing stuff
4607389 even when all henry wants to do is buy booze he keeps getting dragged into these conversations and i love the idea of this curmudgeon who has to deal with people despite himself
4607390 sometimes at the end of a movie ill panic and wonder did i do a good job then i realize ive been spending too much time alone you go from being surrounded by people working every day and being constantly stimulated back to doing nothing
4607391 parab ns pelo sucesso e bom gosto dos depoimentos desses papais maravilhosos este sentimento de amor e entrega entre pais e filhos que nos eleva ao encontro de cristo

4607416 se as arvores o ar a terra as aguas os animais as flores falassem iriam dizer obrigada natura
4607417 acho que todos devem fazer sua parte para tornarmos o planeta um mundo melhor

4607420 sou amiga e defensora da natureza por isoo parabenizo a natura que nos proporciona estes produtos maravilhosos e n o agridem o ambiente

4607422 voces estao sempre na frente em todos os termos na defesa do meio ambientes como na defesa e belesa do corpo humano
4607423 os munic pios deveriam plantar rvores frut feras em vias p blicas com isso acabaria com a fome dos que vivem na rua
4607424 o leo de cozinha desprezado deve ser colocado em um recepiente com tampa e encaminhar para reciclagem tamb m percusos curtos como padaria usar bicicleta ao inv s de carro e fazer sele o do lixo
4607425 as ideias s o bem interessantes mas a energia solar por ser barata enesgotavel nossos governos devem investir para que todos tenham pois creio que contru o de usinas hidr e um desrrespeito a n s
4607426 ha muitas coisas pequenas que causam grande efeito como parar de comer animais para manter esses animais sao gastos enormes quantias de agua e planta oes que viram ra ao desmatam arvores nao e justo
4607427 ainda n o analisei profundamente o trabalho da natura mas pelo pouco li sobre a materia prima e reciclagem e as vendas dos refis pode se v que se a sociedade tivesse conciencia teria o mundo melhor
4607428 acho que deveria ter mais incentivo reciclagem lixeiras coloridas n o basta preciso concientiza o

4607490 sempre gostei de comer mas fui criado moda antiga em que o homem ficava afastado da cozinha de uns tempos para c por m passei a me preocupar com a alimenta o e a dedicar um tempo para isso como minha esposa trabalha muito comecei a inventar receitas para o dia a dia e a chamar amigos e familiares para experiment las
4607491 hoje temos uma esp cie de clube da gula a cada m s um dos amigos do clube oferece um jantar com uma nova receita a regra n o usar nada industrializado como molho de tomate acho que o ato de cozinhar uma forma de agradar a quem amamos uma m gica que une as pessoas
4607492 minha m e me ensinou a cuidar dos alimentos a usar o fogo e os muitos detalhes importantes de uma boa cozinha
4607493 gosto de tudo e fa o o que me d vontade mas os meus pratos preferidos s o os risotos como o arroz de bacalhau e a paella que oferece in meras possibilidades voc pode inventar
4607494 o prazer de cozinhar n o suprir uma necessidade b sica mas oferecer um momento especial s pessoas o ritual que envolve alquimia e experimenta o a degusta o nos faz sonhar e muitas vezes voltar inf ncia guiados por cheiros e sabores que vivem em nossa mem ria
4607495 na europa h uma preocupa o grande em treinar o paladar das crian as e ensin las a preparar os alimentos no dia a dia tanto meninos como meninas no brasil essa atitude est come ando a crescer e os homens t m deixado o preconceito de lado e investido mais nessa arte m gica e sedutora que a gastronomia
4607496 acho muito interecante essas paginas afinal nao sabemos viver sem eles
4607497 concordo com a marta acho que tem que ter uma troca para ser prazeroso ao casal
4607498 no imagin rio infantil os pais sabem tudo podem tudo e essas capacidades permanecem na fantasia das crian as como um poder extraordin rio comparado ao do super her i com o tempo outros her is v o aparecendo na cena um professor um personagem de desenho animado um amigo
4607499 at pouco tempo era tradi o a mulher permanecer exclusivamente em casa dedicando se ao lar e aos filhos ao homem socialmente cabia demonstrar crian a como funciona o mundo l fora j que o interior e as normas do lar eram de dom nio maternal e feminino logo o mito do her i masculino surgiu desse distanciamento e da no o de ser provido por algu m que est distante batalhando pelo p o de todo dia
4607500 acredito que vivenciamos a aventura de um her i moderno s o homens que buscam inovar na atitude masculina introduzindo em suas a es a aceita o e compreens o do feminino o pai moderno forte e corajoso mas tamb m capaz de transmitir afeto e cuidar do lar e dos filhos sem d vida esta uma mudan a que trar benef cios a todos principalmente para as crian as que ter o a oportunidade de viver sob um novo modelo no qual ser feminino ou masculino tem a mesma import ncia e responsabilidade
4607501 com a humaniza o das figuras do pai e da m e podemos criar la os mais intensos e fundamentais para que os pequenos tamb m possam se permitir errar para aprender
4607502 pai palavra singela que vistos por uns podem significar muito mas para outros podem significar nada ser pai n o s dizer sou pai simplesmente exercer o lindo papel de pai
4607503 o amor e o respeito devem andar juntos pois do contrario seria mto dificil existir vida na terra
4607504 que lindo ser pai e ter um pai maravilhoso achei lindo os coment rios
4607505 este site da natura muito dificil de ser visitado se vc n o souber a qual linha pertence um batom por exemplo n o consegue comprar tudo muito confuso e espalhado

4607512 jesus toma conta eu n o sabia que ainda existiam homens da caverna em que mundo voc vive sir alberto
4607513 machismo puro a opini o de sr alberto mais que quando somos crian as somos pr moldadas para mulheres na cozinha tanque e novelas homens no trabalho futebol e bar gra as que o mundo da voltas
4607514 acredito que o homem n o tem suas caracter sticas violadas a partir do momento em que alguns pap is invertem se o homem passa a adquir mais experi ncia passando as para seus filhos s o valores

4607561 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4607562 i still dont think either one of them is at a point to be in a serious committed relationship but they get along and have fun together
4607563 george is devastated by the allegations filed by the court he is devastated and saddened that pam has aired the alleged dirty laundry i dont know what im going to hear next about george he loves his kids so much
4607564 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4607565 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4607566 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4607567 we just want to see improvement hopefully this week well see some things we didnt see the first game
4607568 it makes my job a lot easier but its real intense you have to be paying attention and know whats going on around you its a good opportunity for me but i hate to see brandon go down
4607569 but its not just the games its all the practice reps that you could have gotten so it set him back but he came in focused and hes trying to improve his play
4607570 youre never sure the way youre going to play during the game
4607571 it turned out ok for me but i still have a lot of room to improve
4607572 im just trying to get my foot in the door and trying to turn some heads
4607573 i think ive progressed well up to this point theyre looking for me to keep progressing
4607574 hes a typical rookie there are a lot of things he hasnt seen like the speed of the game the strength of the players but with each practice he gets better
4607575 i was really looking forward to him covering on the first kickoff
4607576 we have him in defensive tackle israel idonijes spot and he went down and made the tackle on the first kickoff he blew up the wedge knocked two guys down and made the tackle that was encouraging being a 6 7 260 pound guy that can run a 4 65 thats impressive
4607577 pomerol wines are subtly different from those across the border in saint emilion pomerols are fresher and more solid than saint emilions richer more plummy and less fruitcakey in flavour compared with medocs they are more obviously velvety but have less austerity and backbone the concentration of fruit is more apparent i find the style delicious and the wines of increasingly high quality

4607579 clint didnt hurt his reputation when he was here he was a great guy in the locker room and i dont feel like he did anything bad i think the main problem for clint is that people were expecting so much out of him and frankly the team around him wasnt good enough for him to be a star

4607590 and its not enough to just create the message effective corporate communication involves not only the message itself but also the medium that carries and delivers it
4607591 the various uses of rss feeds make it a lot easier to communicate and get the information you need from the internet
4607592 at one time e mail was the biggest advancement in corporate communication until users just stopped reading them
4607593 e mail and rss feeds are two different tools but they can complement each other one could argue that e mail makes it easier for people to exchange information while rss feeds make it easier to organize that information
4607594 for corporations an internal rss system can be ideal for delivering the type of information that employees need to know but dont necessarily have to act on right away
4607595 but personally id consider anything that saves time and energy to be advantageous rss feeds do just that
4607596 i can definitely see us using rss feeds more in the future

4607614 the real inflation adjusted change in housing prices this year is more likely to be between zero per cent and minus five per cent for the country as a whole
4607615 while the probability of a u s esque 20 per cent plus decline in canadian house prices looks remote a five per cent to 10 per cent decline is certainly plausible and in fact more likely than it looked even a week ago with yesterdays release of july resale data showing major market prices down 3 6 per cent year over year from a near flat reading in june
4607616 not a surprise that we get some softness in housing prices in some areas of the country as there was some run up in housing prices but we did not have a housing bubble like the americans have had
4607617 new orders rose a solid 2 9 per cent while the inventory to sales ratio dipped to 1 2 the lowest level since april 2007 and an encouraging sign that factories are getting leaner
4607618 even though there was a drop in gasoline prices in august
4607619 it doesnt matter if i play 90 minutes or a minute

4607621 she wasnt playing her best and i think she knew it
4607622 but its hard to handle i went through it last year and its a difficult thing shes not quite her cheery self but we expect that and were here for her
4607623 but i had a long talk with her and i told her tash were going to need you big time in this tournament youre going to have to come on the field were going to need goals from you so figure out a way to make it happen i think she needed to get it off her chest and she came out and she played awesome
4607624 we were just playing some music and singing and dancing we knew we had a lot of time and we just used our time wisely
4607625 when shes waving to the crowd and getting the crowd going that puts a smile on the face of the people that are already tired on the field
4607626 oh never i yelled at my cousin for doing it
4607627 the problem is that texting can certainly lead to accidents

4607635 yes there will be negative comments yes youll invite unsolicited feedback yes people will question your intentions negativity will not go away simply because you opt out of participating negative commentary at the very least is truly an opportunity to change the perception that you did or didnt know existed

4607654 one of the worst political books ever written corsi piles distortion upon innuendo to create a gigantic heap of right wing garbage with a seemingly endless parade of basic factual errors running through the text like rats corsis book is an embarrassment to the craft of journalism and any of the conservatives who have praised and promoted it should feel humiliated at how bad it truly is
4607655 now they botch a gimmie defining corsi as a nut while not putting attention on the charges he leveled
4607656 unlike most of the critics of the obama nation i have actually read the book from cover to cover it is a thoroughly well documented piece of first rate journalism are there mistakes in it show me a first edition that doesnt have some other than the bible but is it truthful does it add considerably to the publics knowledge of the front running candidate for the presidency do we know much more about obama than we would had we relied exclusively for our information from the new york times the los angeles times the washington post and the associated press i offer a resounding yes to all three of those questions i am privileged to call him my friend colleague and co worker i stand with jerry corsi today as he is viciously maligned by an attack media that would prefer to aim its potent artillery at a man who dared to do their job when they refused when they laid down when they sucked up when they failed to ask the tough questions when they took sides
4607657 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him its up to you to spread the truth

4607709 da quando il nostro governo democratico giunto al potere dopo la rivoluzione delle rose nel 2003 la russia ha fatto uso di misure di embargo economico e ha chiuso i confini per isolarci e ha illegalmente deportato migliaia di georgiani in russia ha cercato di destabilizzarci politicamente con laiuto di oligarchi criminali ha cercato di congelarci per sottometterci facendo esplodere cruciali gasdotti nel cuore dellinverno quando tutto ci non riuscito a scuotere la determinazione del popolo georgiano la russia ci ha invaso la settimana scorsa la russia agendo per procura tramite i separatisti ha attaccato diversi pacifici villaggi controllati dalla georgia in ossezia meridionale uccidendo civili innocenti e danneggiando le infrastrutture il 6 agosto poche ore dopo che un alto funzionario georgiano si era recato in ossezia meridionale nel tentativo di negoziare stato lanciato un massiccio attacco contro insediamenti georgiani anche mentre eravamo sotto attacco ho dichiarato un cessate il fuoco unilaterale nella speranza di evitare una escalation e ho annunciato la nostra disponibilit a parlare con i separatisti con qualsiasi formula ma i separatisti e i loro padroni russi sono stati sordi ai nostri appelli di pace
4607710 e certo che linvasione georgiana dellossezia del sud stata un evento orchestrato dal regime di bush

4607777 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4607799 the secretary of defense shall grant access to accredited members of the media at military commemoration ceremonies and memorial services conducted by the armed forces for members of the armed forces who have died on active duty and when the remains of members of the armed forces arrive at military installations in the united states
4607800 we are painfully aware that the department of defense currently prohibits media coverage of these somber ceremonies which in turn bars the public from those images as well
4607801 there will be no arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel returning or departing from ramstein air base or dover air force base
4607802 it takes courage for a 46 year old to wear the outfit shes wearing in these pictures

4607807 nothing gives me more pleasure than pleasing a man with my boobs theyre my best asset squeeze them together and my cleavage is just as tight and fuckable as my pussy
4607808 i just dumped a bloke after wed spent a couple of nights together because he didnt fit me

4607810 i guess thats why when i went online to buy my first sex toys i got a couple of the biggest ones i could see i didnt consider anything smaller they were rather intimidating at first but i soon got used to them now i love the totally filled up feelings i get with one toy in my twat and one in my bum and my orgasms are always fabulous i sometimes use the toys in front of my bloke but i wont let him use them on me you should have seen his face when i asked sweetly if hed like me to use one in his bum the size of a blokes thingie is very important to me

4607826 i have great respect for the emmys and while any gain for nonfiction programming is great hopefully every year well move a bit more in the right direction
4607827 jeff is a huge reason why survivor has been such a success he strikes this balance between providing information and taking an editorial view he calls the contestants to task but has such real warmth about him that everybody loves jeff
4607828 hes not only a great ambassador for our show but hes a great ambassador for our country
4607829 jeff is a pioneer no other show like survivor ever existed
4607830 ryan has been at the forefront of the biggest show to hit primetime television howie took a gameshow and made it special heidi made viewers feel like insiders in the fashion world and tom made this ridiculous ballroom competition make sense everyone in this category has done something remarkable with their shows
4607831 its about people sewing and living in a world thats quite closed off you cant even buy tickets to go to fashion week in new york
4607832 but heidi made it all relatable to the audience and brought them into a part of the fashion world shes not mean but she speaks her mind and is open and honest which comes across well in the show
4607833 tom knows how to make us laugh but also knows when things need to be taken seriously hes spontaneous and sets the tone for the show
4607834 there have been some difficult moments on the air with people dealing with family members dying and other members dying and other tragedies then moments of great humor and tom can handle it all doing a live program like this was a lost art for a long time not that many people can do it
4607835 no one is better at this than ryan hes incredibly professional and hes very good on his feet he can build the dramatic moment or react quickly with humor hes endearing and knows how to connect with the contestants
4607836 you can rely on him to bring the show in on time and he can handle anything that comes up every time we look for a host for another one of our shows we say we need another seacrest unfortunately there isnt one if there were it would be much easier to produce reality shows
4607837 when casting we needed someone like howie who had experience in a variety of entertainment genres
4607838 this show has some extremely tense moments a person on the brink of winning a million dollars can end up with a dollar in their pocket you need someone who can play to those highs and lows and howie does that beautifully howie is the glue that holds this show together you just cant imagine anyone else hosting this show
4607839 field vs stage shows the same way we have seen dramas vs movies categories
4607840 ive always felt reality is the unmentionable bastard offspring no one wants to acknowledge but has to be invited to family events anyway
4607841 if i was to be cynical id say the reality hosts were brought in for the viewers because frankly people are more interested in seeing the hosts of their favorite reality shows than some balding bespectacled producer thanking his parents
4607842 julianne will come back on the show and shes going to be able to sing on the show
4607843 the opposition still has a strong stance against the election results and requests a revote because of many irregularities
4607844 if the king invites new government members to join the swearing in ceremony we will deny but we request the king to reschedule the swearing in ceremony on another day until the national election committee constitutional council and the international community recognize the election as free and fair
4607845 the presence of the king and the majority win of the cpp will disqualify the opposition boycott
4607846 i dont have hope the king can solve the problem because the king has limited political experience to administer the state but the cpps big win if it will use its potential power over the king maybe it will ask the king to take action as stated in the constitution which will be difficult for the king to deny
4607847 usas number one priority is to continue to fly the space shuttle safely and successfully until it is retired at the same time we are fully committed to helping our customers bring the new constellation elements online it is essential to preserve and protect the skilled and experienced workforce that will be needed to accomplish both of these objectives and to ensure that the transition of those critical skills to the new programs does not in any way jeopardize the current program
4607848 we are denouncing the military style practices of the immigration and customs enforcement agency ice who in collaboration with local police departments are terrorizing immigrant communities
4607849 all immigrant communities condemn the ice raids detentions and deportations of loved ones and community members
4607850 raids instill fear in communities and instill mistrust in government institutions they unnecessarily tear families apart ice should make information about those who have been detained in these raids easily available to the families of the detainees for example why were they detained where were they taken how long will they be there what are the next steps planned for these individuals community members should contact their senators and representative in order to express their concern about these raids community members should also contact the local ice office in order to continue to try to get more information about the raids and who has been impacted
4607851 the current state of immigration policy and its harsh enforcement are not only out of step with our current global economy and global interconnectedness but they also violate the united states core foundational principles all human beings are created equal and endowed with unalienable rights by the creator the gross inhumane treatment being perpetrated against immigrants is not acceptable we are here to say enough no more raids no more ice presence in our neighborhoods our main demand is the enactment of responsible and humane immigration reform including legal permanent residency for all undocumented immigrants we demand the humane treatment of immigrants we demand the re unification of our families
4607852 we were chosen to finish in the top four and in order to do that we will have to play smart tough soccer every game
4607853 yeah hit a shot that hit fernandos racquet and then went out the umpire didnt see that it hit his racquet
4607854 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4607855 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4607856 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it how much i love the other athletes what theyve sacrificed and you appreciate that and the guys go out and compete their hardest win fair and square lose fair and square
4607857 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4607858 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win usually its in the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship whatever that happens out there all the time
4607859 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player i cant take away anything from the fact he won the match came from back from three match points down served really well hung in the whole time im not going to take anything away from the kind of tennis he can play but theres still a level of disappointment in him
4607860 shes been playing great tennis the last couple of months shes in great form in the moment
4607861 and she has won like a few tournaments so the results show shes really playing well and she deserves to be in the top of the womans game in this moment because a lot of us are injured and not playing very well not in a great form so she has a chance to become no 1 or very close to no 1
4607862 but its not a question of becoming no 1 now the year is quite long and we still have a lot of tournaments to play until the end of the year so it will be a battle
4607863 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4607864 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies
4607865 i dont sleep with everyone who is better than hitler
4607866 joe was asking him questions where did he get the phone was he placing ieds was he taliban

4607873 the times when you have seen only one set of footprints in the sand is when i carried you
4607874 heroism and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of military service
4607875 after dragging his wounded comrades to safety he returned alone and exposed himself to small arms fire in order to direct and adjust mortar fire against hostile emplacements
4607876 boldly attacking the hill with the remaining men of his squad
4607877 i must rewrite old pages because i think it better
4607878 fight them the disbelievers allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace and give you victory over them and he will heal the hearts of those who believe
4607879 we havent officially heard about the plan from official israeli leaders all what sic we hear about are just media balloons to show that israel is serious in the peace process
4607880 these are half truths used by israelis as a test balloon so they can blame the palestinian authority should the negotiations fail
4607881 we are not a bazaar we want a complete israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 including jerusalem and agreement on all the final status questions
4607882 the israeli proposal is not acceptable the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and with the june 4 1967 boundaries

4607907 gonzalez is in the gold medal match but blake got cheated and gonzalez knew it it is sort of a tough call almost one that on honor you are supposed to call it on yourself when the ball hits your racket
4607908 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemens sport thats the time to call it on yourself i looked him square in the eye and he didnt call it ive tried to play this game for as long as i can i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose a match you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4607909 i said earlier the only way i could see nadal winning is if djokovic makes some errors hes made a couple of errors in this game and its brought nadal to break point two forehand mistakes off short balls
4607910 nadal who came out on fire really limped to the finish line but got away with the win

4607930 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4607931 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4607932 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4607933 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

4607935 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4607936 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4607937 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4607973 for many a repossession order is a wake up call to make them sort out the situation and avoid actually the finality of actually losing their home
4607974 as the credit crunch continues we expect more people to get into difficulty over their mortgage payments

4608166 company guy who is hot on our guys tail when the season begins there is a cover story that our guys are placed into a supermax prison and slowly but surely clues are coming out that they arent in there that theyre up to something else maybe this guys job is to find out what theyre really up to
4608167 a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily do
4608168 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4608169 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4608170 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4608171 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4608172 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4608173 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4608174 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4608175 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
4608176 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4608177 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4608178 it all started with this brochure in my school mailbox i get them all the time but this one caught my eye
4608179 participating teachers will spend five days in philadelphia six days in gettysburg and six days in washington d c studying the american revolution and founding the civil war and the civil rights movement respectively
4608180 the academy will thereby expose participants to the ideas and arguments that shaped these three great american eras the documents that make up our history and the places where the history was made during their stay in each of these cities participants will be surrounded by the streets and halls the battlefields public places and private lodgings where the history they are studying took place
4608181 my three favorite areas of history are the founding the civil war and the civil rights movement
4608182 the guy from virginia was unable to take the trip and they offered it to me
4608183 if i had to pick one moment that when i knew i wanted to teach history that was it
4608184 the city is filled with history the historic symbolism of the monuments
4608185 because i knew more about that history this time around
4608186 in one government class he was trying to start a dialogue about the founding fathers but couldnt it was at that point he decided he would try to get something passed to help teach the founding better
4608187 any bill passed by both houses is an amazing thing
4608188 ive read books but to see the hills and stand there where it happened it was pretty emotional
4608189 you dont get to do that on the regular tour
4608190 they all kind of relate to each other the declaration and the founding lincoln expanded it and what it means to be an american and the dream the fulfillment of that
4608191 when we meet as history teachers its about standards of learning testing
4608192 it was very refreshing not to talk about that but about the creative part of teaching
4608193 i have always emphasized the use of first hand documents like the declaration
4608194 you dont get from reading about a document what you get from the document itself
4608195 i think it will make communication better in general in families i think it will make learning sign language a lot easier for people
4608196 the idea is that you should be able to produce a sign in front of a web cam and the computer will recognize based on the visual properties of what youve just done what sign it is that you produced
4608197 beatles 65 which once again did not have a matching track list
4608198 why do we need a fighter designed to fight the cold war and engage in dog fights with russians jets over the north sea
4608199 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4608200 areas already wealthy have tended to become disproportionatly wealthier and were seeing some evidence of increasing polarisation in particular there are now areas in some of our cities where over half of all households are breadline poor
4608201 this year the hedge fund was down about 77 through july which comes on top of a roughly 34 decline last year

4608206 im not sure where that picture came from but i think it was doctored
4608207 talk about bizarre it all seems like a seinfeld episode to me if only coach bevilacqua was here to settle this
4608208 im just happy to be able to get the products because i know a lot of people that are screaming for them but these guys are just kooky
4608209 our operating performance in the second quarter was greatly improved continuing the positive trend we have shown each quarter since our restructuring
4608210 we are clearly realizing the anticipated benefits of the significant business restructuring we initiated last year
4608211 were happy to report that all of our shipping centers are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues
4608212 throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail if a member should have been shipped a disc tuesday wednesday or thursday with rare exception it will ship today friday
4608213 taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
4608214 we hope you find it empowering educational and inspiring as we ask for harry potter fans across the world to embrace the olympic and the triwizard ideal of one world one dream
4608215 it is unfortunate that allstates disregard of florida law required the office to take the drastic actions that we did in order to bring allstate into compliance
4608216 however the terms agreed to by allstate in the consent order go a long way toward restoring confidence in allstates business practices and will provide a great benefit to their policyholders and future policyholders
4608217 the resolution of this matter demonstrates our desire to work with the office of insurance regulation and to put the issues in dispute behind us
4608218 allstate must continue to cooperate with the offices investigation of its claim payment practices including matters related to the 1992 mckinsey report
4608219 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
4608220 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4608221 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology
4608222 defendants long standing patterns of default lateness and abject failure to comply with court orders amounts to willful conduct which not only warrants but necessitates award of default judgment
4608223 sold the new york flatotel to a bahamian company controlled by hotelier simon elias in 2000 without disclosing the transaction to cdr and without making any payment on the loan
4608224 but for commercial and closed source platforms its just a black box test
4608225 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4608226 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4608227 god tells us to love each other and love doesnt discriminate
4608228 shell be with the next guy who catches her eye she cant help it
4608229 the combination with elitech will accelerate the transition of nanogen into a global profitable diagnostics company with the critical mass needed to bring our leading molecular and point of care technologies to customers worldwide
4608230 i believe the resulting combination will create value for our shareholders customers and employees
4608231 this is a true example of synergy between two companies in the in vitro diagnostics industry
4608232 we are delighted to be able to combine nanogens technology strength with our market reach in the international marketplace and collectively deliver the critical mass required to address the us diagnostic market
4608233 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4608234 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4608235 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4608236 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4608237 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
4608238 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4608239 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
4608240 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4608241 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4608242 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4608243 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4608244 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
4608245 the block copolymer lattice is sort of fooled by these pillars and forms its array around them they form a nice ordered pattern around the pillars
4608246 by properly choosing the spatial distribution of the pillars to match a desired final structure it was possible to consistently generate defect free polymer nanostructures
4608247 nature allows you to get these really well ordered structures without doing much work
4608248 the state of the industry in magnetic media is really ready for this
4608249 the ultimate goal would be a complete self assembling chip structure
4608250 ultimately this is a technology that is very high resolution and very scalable
4608251 they will be laying the foundations for technologies that will enable an inside view of cancer cell functions as opposed to the limited blackbox input output techniques currently used
4608252 west bromwich albion football club also known as west brom the baggies albion the albion the throstles or wba are an english professional football club based in west bromwich west midlands the club was formed in 1878 by workers from salters spring works in west bromwich and have played their home games at the hawthorns since 1900
4608253 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4608254 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
4608255 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
4608256 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
4608257 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
4608258 photronics third quarter performance was primarily affected by reduced demand for high end ic photomasks as a result of the downturn in the memory market and customer restructurings while we expect that the memory market will remain soft for the near term we remain committed to our high end strategy and expect that it will be an important long term contributor to photronics future growth qualifications with key customers are progressing and we anticipate an increase in high end ic photomask sales over the next few quarters
4608259 during this time we will continue to accelerate our cost reduction programs in order to improve our bottom line and better leverage our sales growth when the market rebounds
4608260 lockheed martin is already a leader in the research development and application of nanotechnology to future military and intelligence applications
4608261 this transaction represents a solid strategic fit it provides an important set of capabilities and will accelerate our product applications enabling us to offer a broader portfolio of solutions to our customers and to enhance shareholder value
4608262 we are proud of the success our government business unit has had which will now be even greater as part of lockheed martin this transaction provides nantero with increased resources and strategic focus to achieve our goals in the commercial memory space
4608263 we are very pleased to join lockheed martin and look forward to applying our carbon nanotube technologies to a broader array of programs and customer requirements this will enhance capabilities for our customers and provide exciting opportunities for our exceptionally talented employees
4608264 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case he specifically called him by name in this case
4608265 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4608266 change the header to assault on a police officer and fondling
4608267 this was very stressful to me personally i was under a lot of stress my way of alleviating stress is to make light of things
4608268 were trying to build a sense of community with the garden
4608269 its not only for food it also gives people a chance to engage with one another
4608270 whod have thought that a tomato stake would have meant anything
4608271 our fuel costs just for the trucks were up 37 6 percent for the year
4608272 the word of the cross is the power of god
4608273 we preach christ crucified unto them that are called christ the power of god
4608274 i determined to know nothing among you save jesus christ and him crucified
4608275 many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
4608276 there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders so as to deceive if it were possible the very elect
4608277 he doeth great signs that he should even make fire come down from heaven upon the earth in the sight of men and he deceiveth them that dwell upon the earth
4608278 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked
4608279 the god of this age hath blinded the minds of them that believe not
4608280 thou shalt stand before kings and rulers and nations to whom i send thee to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god
4608281 god knows if you do that you will be as god knowing good and evil and god forbidding you to do that is simply robbing you of something which being yours would make your life fuller and larger and greater and so god after all is not favourable to you and is keeping something back he is making life smaller and narrower than it need be and if you will only do as i tell you you will have a life higher than that
4608282 let them bring me gold and silver and brass and precious stones and fine linen and let them make me a sanctuary
4608283 many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
4608284 does the devil make men pure and turn men from godlessness to a life of god interest
4608285 he that is joined to the lord is one spirit
4608286 the soulical man he is the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them
4608287 leave your hair sparkling the perfect combination of hold and sparking ice like shine every time
4608288 we wanted to get him in a more relaxed environment to work things out to get him back going
4608289 he needs to go down there and work on his command
4608290 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4608291 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4608292 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4608293 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4608294 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4608295 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4608296 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4608297 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4608298 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4608299 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4608300 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4608301 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4608302 i know it in my heart she couldnt have done any of the things shes accused of
4608303 nothing has been proven that this lady has done anything wrong
4608304 she cannot do her job she cannot come to school and perform her jobs as kindergarten teacher
4608305 we have a lot of people who say these charges are bogus but no one other than me knows what the evidence is
4608306 she has a perfect history as a teacher and i know her as an individual and i know her to be a person of high integrity these charges are both politically motivated by some local people in and out of this community and in tennessee and georgia
4608307 all i can say is that what you see in the media is not always true you shouldnt believe everything that you see
4608308 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4608309 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4608310 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4608311 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4608312 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4608313 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4608314 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4608315 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4608316 we dont need three presidents and thats what you would have if hillary was picked barack hillary and bill
4608317 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4608318 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4608319 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4608320 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4608321 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4608322 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4608323 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4608324 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4608325 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4608326 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4608327 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4608328 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4608329 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4608330 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4608331 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4608332 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4608333 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4608334 its just another attempt to embarrass me to slow me up to keep my from doing what i want to do
4608335 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4608336 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4608337 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4608338 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4608339 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4608340 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4608341 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4608342 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4608343 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4608344 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4608345 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4608346 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4608347 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4608348 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4608349 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4608350 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4608351 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4608352 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4608353 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4608354 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4608355 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4608356 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4608357 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4608358 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4608359 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4608360 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4608361 we recognize theres a lot of competition for these funds
4608362 thats my biggest concern that well lose the momentum that we have now
4608363 you owe it to yourselves and your neighbors and the world to preserve this
4608364 lake tahoe is one of the most beloved and special places on earth
4608365 but the lake and surrounding basin are natural treasures at risk
4608366 as stewards of this jewel of the sierra it is our responsibility to do everything we can to preserve the lake
4608367 you cant think of the long term without recognizing climate change
4608368 the big buzz we should and need to focus on is preventing these invaders from coming into the lake
4608369 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4608370 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4608371 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4608372 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4608373 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4608374 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4608375 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4608376 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4608377 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4608378 i got 5 to play this song you dont like it 6 will get you a different song
4608379 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4608380 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4608381 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4608382 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4608383 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4608384 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4608385 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4608386 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4608387 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4608388 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4608389 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4608390 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4608391 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4608392 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4608393 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4608394 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4608395 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4608396 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4608397 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4608398 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4608399 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4608400 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4608401 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4608402 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4608403 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4608404 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4608405 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4608406 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4608407 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4608408 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4608409 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4608410 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4608411 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4608412 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4608413 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4608414 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4608415 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4608416 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4608417 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4608418 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4608419 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4608420 ive had a crap day im not up to par with what i know i can do
4608421 im not as competitive as i should be and i dont know what is possible now
4608422 im so disappointed im really gutted im in much better shape than that
4608423 im disappointed with the whole day maybe its because its my first heptathlon of the year
4608424 its solid and only my shot was really poor but overall it was just average
4608425 i wanted to win that 200m and run under 23 seconds because thats what ive been doing in training
4608426 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4608427 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4608428 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4608429 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4608430 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4608431 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4608432 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4608433 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4608434 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4608435 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4608436 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4608437 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4608438 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4608439 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4608440 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4608441 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4608442 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4608443 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4608444 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4608445 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4608446 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4608447 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4608448 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4608449 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4608450 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4608451 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4608452 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4608453 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4608454 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4608455 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4608456 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4608457 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4608458 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4608459 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4608460 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4608461 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4608462 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4608463 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4608464 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4608465 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4608466 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4608467 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4608468 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4608469 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4608470 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4608471 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4608472 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4608473 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4608474 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4608475 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4608476 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4608477 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4608478 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4608479 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4608480 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4608481 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4608482 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4608483 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4608484 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4608485 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4608486 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4608487 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4608488 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4608489 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4608490 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4608491 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4608492 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4608493 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4608494 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4608495 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4608496 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4608497 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4608498 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4608499 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4608500 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4608501 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4608502 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4608503 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4608504 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4608505 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4608506 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4608507 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4608508 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4608509 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4608510 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4608511 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4608512 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4608513 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4608514 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4608515 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4608516 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4608517 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4608518 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4608519 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4608520 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4608521 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4608522 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4608523 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4608524 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4608525 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4608526 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4608527 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4608528 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4608529 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4608530 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4608531 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4608532 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4608533 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4608534 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4608535 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4608536 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4608537 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4608538 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4608539 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4608540 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4608541 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4608542 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4608543 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4608544 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4608545 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4608546 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4608547 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4608548 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4608549 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4608550 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4608551 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4608552 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4608553 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4608554 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4608555 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4608556 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4608557 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4608558 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4608559 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4608560 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4608561 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4608562 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4608563 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4608564 but as we were getting everything set up for the party the contractions ramped up to about every four to five minutes
4608565 everyone gathered around for a quick prayer for a safe easy as possible labor and we took off
4608566 i was so scared by then that we were going to deliver this baby with no outside help whatsoever that panic was only a breath away
4608567 the midwife was very calming and soon she had me back in the bathroom repeating to jessica and kevin what she said to me first thing she said was get the nose aspirator out of the birthing kit oh the birthing kit how could we have forgotten i was struggling along using old towels rags toilet paper and baby wipes those chux would have been so handy
4608568 weve made it childbirth such a medical event and it doesnt have to be
4608569 its the most natural thing in the world and women have been doing it forever
4608570 she carries everything she could possibly need in case of an emergency
4608571 people asked us how we could consider a home birth when something could go wrong but really 99 times out of 100 nothing does
4608572 to meet cadrian here in our own house with kevin and my mom here was just so special
4608573 gods hand was upon us all and he answered the prayer we prayed in an unexpected way
4608574 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4608575 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4608576 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4608577 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4608578 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4608579 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4608580 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4608581 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4608582 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4608583 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4608584 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4608585 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4608587 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4608588 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4608594 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4608595 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4608596 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4608597 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4608598 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4608599 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4608600 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4608601 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs

4608607 many military have government travel cards that can be used for fees
4608608 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4608609 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4608610 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4608611 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4608612 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4608613 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4608614 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4608615 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4608616 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4608617 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4608618 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4608619 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4608620 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4608621 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4608622 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4608623 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4608624 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4608625 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4608626 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4608627 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4608628 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4608629 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4608630 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4608632 what if you couldnt marry the person you love every day gay and lesbian couples are prevented from marrying
4608633 on one level i really like this approach because it uses the wedding industrial complex against itself taking the ultimate heteronormative capitalist celebration and turning it into an argument for equality i like that
4608634 is directly targeted at the 8 to 10 percent of undecided california voters it is not for people who have already decided to vote no on prop 8 who are likely the same people who will question traditional wedding customs and what is a proper marriage this ad basically makes the marriage proposition one about fairness and equality
4608635 i would rather see an ad that queered marriage than one that shows a rich white couple getting married and suggests that everyone else should be able to be like them as if its the goal that everyone should aspire to
4608636 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4608637 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4608638 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12

4608644 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4608645 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4608707 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different

4608781 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4608782 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4608783 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4608796 but there was a certain man simon by name who beforetime used magical arts in that city and led astray the people of samaria declaring that he himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this is the power of god which is called great
4608797 the successor of this man was menander also a samaritan by birth and he too was a perfect adept in the practice of magic he affirms that the primary power continues unknown to all but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour for the deliverance of men the world was made by angels whom like simon he maintains to have been produced by ennoea
4608798 but it need not be supposed that when simon broke with the christians he renounced all he had learned it is more probable that he carried some of the christian ideas with him and that he wove these into a system of his own this system did contain some of the later germs of gnosticism thus he became a leader of a retro grade sect perhaps nominally christian and certainly using some of the christian terminology but in reality anti christian and exalting simon himself to the central position which christianity was giving to jesus christ
4608799 o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called

4608801 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
4608802 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ should shine unto them
4608803 and as they did not think fit to have god in their knowledge god gave them up to a reprobate mind to do those things that are not convenient

4608866 you are threatening an officer of the city and i would recommend that you take your ticket and have a nice day
4608867 thats it i am using my authority to place you under arrest
4608868 you assaulted an officer of the city by almost blinding me with the ticket i issued you
4608869 i dont want to hear a dam word out your mouth
4608870 whether some people interpret that as sexy some people interpret it as being casual everyone projects onto it what they want
4608871 i think the most important thing is what he projects out which is this is who i am and this is what im doing
4608872 there is no public evidence of her ever using the word whitey
4608873 there is a part of the population who i think very much votes with its hormones if you will
4608874 and this part of the campaign is playing out to that segment of the population
4608875 it has been the source of great inspiration and a source of hope

4608880 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4608881 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4608882 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4608883 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4608884 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4608885 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4608886 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4608887 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4608888 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4608889 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4608890 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4608891 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4608892 his voice sounded very strong and his laughter his spirit was great

4608898 the problem of poverty or underachievement is not that the poor lack freedom the real problem is that the poor are too free
4608899 the paternalistic presumption implicit in the schools portrayed here is that the poor lack the family and community support culutral capital and poersonal follow through to live according to the middle class values that they too espouse
4608900 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far police inspector cornelius charles said

4608904 now they enjoy full access to the bed where we all sleep together
4608905 we feel at the moment a greater concern for our safety
4608906 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west
4608907 it seems that the americans have changed their view due to the situation in the caucasus
4608908 in the eyes of washington this conflict has proved that russia isnt a stable partner and continues to consider its international surroundings as its exclusive sphere of influence
4608909 with russian tanks rolling into georgia theres a feeling among former eastern bloc states that the tanks could roll over their borders too theres a certain urgency now
4608910 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4608911 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4608912 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4608913 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4608914 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4608915 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4608916 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make a decision that unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4608917 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4608918 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4608919 this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for everyone not just for us this will be just the first chapter
4608920 the decision in bucharest was interpreted as a green light in russia

4608929 i think it pitched in line and was hitting middle
4608930 yeah you are correct and the height seems to be okay
4608931 actually it pitched outside off and hit him in front of middle so there is an angle and there is a distance for the ball to cover so your basis for giving it out is wrong let me have a look

4608943 people have a tendency as you well know to get all bent out of shape over stuff
4608944 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow

4608964 theyre deciding on paternity leave but nobody in australia really knows what effect it may have if dads stay home with their children
4608965 we need to bring fathers into the discussion but the research isnt there
4608966 the chances are that we are using a lot of energy and taxpayers money
4608967 we know that fathers have an effect on literacy and breastfeeding rates but usually the lactation consultants only talk to the mums
4608968 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship to motherhood
4608969 the debate has been largely framed from the mothers perspective either from a traditional standpoint that its womens work or from a feminist standpoint that its definitely womens work
4608970 the whole area of male role models fatherhood male involvement in childrearing has never been sufficiently investigated and needs attention
4608971 gender roles are changing and couples with children are having to navigate and negotiate that

4608994 i just love all the camaraderie with all the different people you meet and you make friends for life here
4608995 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4608996 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4608997 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4608998 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4608999 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4609000 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4609001 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4609002 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4609003 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4609004 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4609005 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4609006 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4609007 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4609008 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4609009 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4609010 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4609011 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4609012 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4609013 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4609014 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4609015 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4609016 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4609017 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4609018 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4609019 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4609020 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4609021 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4609022 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4609023 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4609024 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4609025 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4609026 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4609027 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4609028 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4609029 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4609030 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
4609031 i have a friend of mine that is adamantly opposed to getting into anything serious with women hes a serial dater like you
4609032 look i see that you like dan and youre having a good time and all but i want to tell you something
4609033 when he says hes not interested in a relationship that doesnt mean
4609034 what the hell is happening why are these women so crazy is it them is it me wtf
4609035 it makes me a little uncomfortable that you think you can say one thing and do something different and expect someone to understand that you mean what you say not what you do
4609036 in my experience it didnt matter how many times i said it nor how bluntly some women just filtered that bit of information out and ignored it because they wanted something different there comes a point when you the op need to stop feeling responsible for the other parties misinterpretations if you can look yourself in the eye and be sure you said what was needed to make your point clear and just accept that it isnt always going to be taken at face value by some therein lies the problem some people always interpret rather than listen to my mindset male engineer type that isnt at all logical and was the source of major exasperation to me for being unable to get my point across without pissing people off op some people will always interpret no matter what you say youll just have to deal with it it doesnt mean you have to change
4609037 one fine day all was made clear to me by a young lady who explained to me that women in general think that if they can change themselves or do something differently your intentions may change
4609038 if i tell you i hate you 10 times over the course of a day and interject that i like you once or twice what are you going to believe
4609039 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4609040 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4609041 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4609042 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4609043 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4609044 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4609045 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4609046 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4609047 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4609048 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4609049 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4609050 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4609051 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4609052 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4609053 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4609054 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4609055 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4609056 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4609057 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4609058 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4609059 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4609060 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4609061 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4609062 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4609063 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4609064 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4609065 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4609066 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4609067 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4609068 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4609069 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4609070 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4609071 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4609072 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

4609111 this is not my investigation someone else is handling it
4609112 oldfield conceded to us that there is not one ripper but at least two
4609113 i agree with your premise that sutcliffe was not responsible for all the murders
4609114 it was known in the top echelons of the police that two men were involved in the series of murders
4609115 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he
4609116 this man will continue to kill until hes caught no woman is safe
4609117 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble

4609119 i would appeal to anyone who has seen a watch or phone like beckys to come forward
4609120 my team has focused on a large number of suspects over a very short period of time
4609121 i would like to remind people that becky was a 19 year old mother of
4609122 i believe somebody local is out there who murdered this young
4609123 to have been found naked and beaten to death in an alleyway is an
4609124 i want to make sure that beckys son jordan grows up knowing that we caught his mums killer and i can only do that with the help of the people of bradford
4609125 do you know anyone who wears one of these watches or have you found a watch or been sold a watch like it
4609126 even if someone has innocently bought a south park watch or has been given one as a gift from someone it is important they contact us in confidence
4609127 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch
4609128 the other only major outstanding feature of the yorkshire ripper investigation remains the identity of the man with the geordie accent who sent george oldfield the infamous letters and tape in 1999 during the production of the itv documentary manhunt the search for the yorkshire ripper a request was made by the production team to west yorkshire police for facilities to film a dna test being made on the envelopes the letters and tape came in it would have been a way of showing the great changes the police had made in the detection of crime the intention was to see if the dna matched any of the profiles held in the then fledgling national dna database if it did not then dna from the envelopes from the gum on theflap or from the stamp the sender would have licked could be registered on the database of crime scene profiles if the person who sent the tapes was arrested for a reportable crime in the future then the police could identify him forensic scientists had already shown he was a blood group b secretor a dna analysis from traces of saliva could have nailed him and brought him to book charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice it was not to be several months after the initial inquiry the somewhat embarrassed response came back sorry weve lost the envelopes and there is no reasonable hope of us finding them the hoaxer has never been traced and probably never will be
4609129 i felt all hope was lost the fact that they can do that to people that nearly a decade ago were sentenced for their crimes is beyond me
4609130 ive got kids so id want to know living in my area who is a sex offender and who isnt

4609178 happiness is feeling more joy the day my divorce was final than i did on the wedding day
4609179 and then my boss had had a few drinks of his own and in the midst of that cozy churchy pot luck gathering banged his spoon on a table and called everyone to silence to make a toast he bellowed something slurred and incoherent about
4609180 heres to long hot nights lots of fights and lots of sweet sweet love and making up
4609181 an outdoor wedding a bride going shall we say al fresco whether for fashion or for ventilation i still dont know a venturesome bee a honeymoon night to remember but very much not in the way im sure she had hoped
4609182 my mother in law made a big deal about hosting the rehearsal dinner which turned out to be brownies and a cheese log rolled in corn flakes
4609183 after the ceremony was over i ducked back into the chapel and got close enough to see what the cross was made from macaroni elbow macaroni noodled glued to a foam background and then spray painted gold it was an arts amp crafts project from summer camp gone horribly horribly wrong
4609184 in the end a firetruck an ambulance and two police cars showed up to the church weve got cute pictures of the couple in the firetruck with my sister in law wearing a firemans hat
4609185 we put a bottle of champagne in the lake to cool it waves started carrying it to the east none of the four other people present wanted to go grab it the wusses and the dog best man was no retriever so i in my red silk dress waded into lake michigan which in early may is none too warm
4609186 as the flower girl i was dressed as a jester and my mom the best woman wore a black and white striped prison jumpsuit from a costume shop
4609187 i wish i could end this by saying that at least he found out about her lying ways before he married her
4609188 lets see other than his grandma asking both of us about 100 times on the wedding day if we had condoms for the honeymoon
4609189 preggo bride and groom disappear for the honeymoon on a 4wheeler with ribbons and cans attached to sign reading
4609190 the looks of sheer horror on my sisters face when she caught the bouquet as if it was an omen of doom
4609191 when we got to the wedding though it turns out that no one else had worn a costume the church was full of a hundred tastefully formally dressed wedding guests and then my parents looking straight out of drag hell
4609192 i worked over 100 weddings as a server at a catering company so ive got a ton of awful wedding stories most of them involve hundreds of indian people unhappy brides and grooms in arranged marriages and goat curry served with something that looks suspiciously like tomato soup and ramen

4609194 my maid of honour had two sprained ankles and still got down to sex machine then was pointed out for getting out of her freakin wheelchair to dance
4609195 i get to the do you takes and the bride looks me in the eye and says
4609196 the funny thing i remember of the day is when my mom got dressed shed chosen a long lacy dark green dress with matching green tights and shoes which had my brother and i singing
4609197 she certainly made the wedding photographer happy by adding a certain creature of the black lagoon atmosphere to the whole event
4609198 dont even get me started on how the in laws who were in the wedding didnt bother to show up for the rehearsal and were late the day of the wedding and have still never actually met my parents to this day the mil came to the ceremony in a pinned together dress that started to fall apart when she stepped forward to do her part how the person video taping the wedding realized she was running out of batteries on the camcorder and just stopped filming half of the ceremony because
4609199 my second cousin daniel absolutely hates the song ymca whenever it plays he refuses to dance or sing he just sits there with his arms crossed and glowers since hes a big sports fan he does this quite a bit
4609200 my husband broke the solemn pact we made not to smash cake in each others faces the real problem is that he broke the pact before i did
4609201 the wedding party is introduced the bride and groom are introduced and just seconds after they walk through the hall doors in comes nikki behind them dressed in a black sheath dress and a black funerary hat complete with veil and black sunglasses she was in mourning
4609202 on the day of the wedding auntie shows up in a long white dress not a motherly white dress a wedding dress
4609203 the bride threw the bouquet and every single woman including me stepped backwards with her hands at her sides so as not to catch it
4609204 when i left the bride was locked in the bathroom crying the groom was drinking himself into oblivion and the best man was in the car park with some of the grooms fraternity brothers getting the shit kicked out of him
4609205 my worst wedding moment memory is when my uncle got drunk he was of course the groom and his bride didnt notice he was a bit tipsy because she herself had over indulged but my uncle was the worst he had to be stopped from hitting on women at the party after the ceremony
4609206 i really didnt like having to call everyone who had brought children to my wedding that my daughter had apparently been contagious with the chicken pox
4609207 when they twisted the two individual candles loose to light the unity candle the brides exploded
4609208 my cousins wedding reception gave 80 of the guests dire food poisoning
4609209 my wedding went well seeing as how i expected something to go wrong the wedding night however landed us all in the hospital while my husband watched his grandmother pass away

4609214 the current funding is most welcome and it addresses a very important need
4609215 but this is a battle that we are having to wage year in and year out
4609216 what that bill does is take the funding for monitoring and treatment out of the annual appropriations process and make it part of mandatory funding
4609217 a way to look at it is medicare for people who were exposed to toxins as a result of the world trade center attacks so its an entitlement
4609218 this is exactly what the law says and what it allows
4609219 if the republicans are trying to close the window they would be violating the law they wrote

4609221 an illegal loophole in the state law to advance same day registration and voting which was never a consideration when the general assembly passed the law
4609222 this has nothing to do with denying people access to the ballot
4609223 the issue is about whether or not safeguards are in place
4609224 they are trying to deflect and confuse and suppress voters
4609225 this is walking down the path of scaring and intimidating voters and suppressing the vote in an important election year
4609226 our hope is that everyone will take a step back and work together in voters best interests to find solutions to these questions rather than fight it out with press releases and lawsuits public squabbling just leads to voter confusion

4609237 i want to ensure that benefits will be there for retirees who need them in the future thats why i support having a national discussion on this issue all options should be on the table for consideration including private accounts
4609238 ive always thought its a little unfair to the person thats making 50 000 a year that 100 percent of their salary or wages is being taxed for social security

4609251 the short of it is that being athletic and being fit has its privileges
4609252 basically michael phelps metabolism is so fast that his metabolism needs an enormous amount of calories so eating 12 000 calories a day isnt an enormous amount of food compared to his metabolism
4609253 look at his physique and look at his performance and it speaks for itself
4609254 he is able to maintain recovery from each event such that he can win a gold medal in the next event or contribute to one and he can maintain a lean physique hes leaner than the average swimmer as well he looks to me from looking at the pictures to be 7 or 8 percent body fat
4609255 like lance armstrong these are athletes that are off the measurable scale for determining regular metabolic rate or physiological performance
4609256 these guys are at the extreme top so we cant apply average everyday physiology of a lay person to an elite athlete like these they are genetically gifted and trained

4609280 cuando nos critiquen hay que tener coherencia en las cr ticas
4609281 yo veo al ministro de comercio supongo que est equivocada la noticia pero parece con comillas diciendo que despu s de la subida de la tasa de inter s pasada hubo una apreciaci n muy fuerte del peso si se va hablar de la tasa de cambio d lar hay que hacerle un seguimiento a la tasa de cambio porque despu s de la medida pasada hay una devaluaci n de cerca de 6 puntos porcentuales entonces a la gente no se le puede decir lo que no es si se va a hablar de tasa de cambio hay que entender que es una tasa de cambio entender que es un comportamiento de la tasa de cambio y reflejar la realidad que es una devaluaci n del 6 por ciento posterior a la decisi n de la junta directiva
4609282 esa mayor tasa de inter s iba a generar una apreciaci n del peso
4609283 comenz efectivamente la tasa de cambio cerca de 30 por debajo a como hab a cerrado el viernes pero termin cerca de 10 por encima
4609284 eso confirma lo que hemos dicho siempre el diferencial de tasas de inter s es un elemento que puede afectar el comportamiento de la tasa de cambio pero no es el nico pero no el fundamental

4609401 few multi step pathways have been fully reconstituted and the urge to tackle them has diminished the refined genetic analyses of events in cell biology and developmental biology cry out for efforts to observe them in a cell free system
4609402 it goes from zero to 78 mph and gives you a feeling of what gale force winds feel like
4609403 its really a fun way to experience some of the wind forces tornados and hurricanes or just south dakota wind can generate
4609404 its fun to experience but why is that important well you know tornados are a naturally occuring thing in our environment and its something you need to be aware of certainly
4609405 as we understand the science then we are better able to prepare for hazardous weather as well
4609406 weve had that twice today at first i didnt know what was going with everything
4609407 im kind of shocked you dont find it a lot today its very nice and refreshing i guess it just gives you a brighter outlook for the day
4609408 the linux foundation has published a how to document for developers who want to

4609412 star wars from a man who cares little about established continuity its star wars that takes place in a time period already over crouded sic with conflicting stories and source materials i understand that lucas wanted to continue the story into television but jesus christ couldnt he have picked a point in the saga that wasnt filled with stories some of which he himself approved
4609413 we follow the adventures of anakin skywalker and obi wan kenobi as well as other jedi fighting to preserve the lofty ideals of the republic against count dooku and his cronies who are threatening to tear the galaxy apart
4609414 even though it was animated in a stylized cg form george made it very clear to director
4609415 hes an encyclopedia of star wars knowledge combining all the hundreds of comics dozens of novels and games too there is just so much in the expanded universe everything not in the movies it was great knowing leland was there to prevent any grave inconsistencies from coming to pass
4609416 were going to see another side to him in the movie when he was a champion of the republic and a great jedi hero so hes not the brooding petulant kid we knew from the movies but the best friend and comrade in arms of obi wan kenobi as well as a playful big brother like mentor to his new padawan ahsoka tano
4609417 a guy like that is indispensable in a galaxy that has grown as large as it has
4609418 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4609419 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4609420 its not about whether you have problems or dont have them
4609421 youre going to have to pay us or this wont go away
4609422 i said to myself either shes a good actor and a good liar or what they have done to her is really crummy
4609423 the riaa is fighting very hard to make sure that andersens case never reaches a jury

4609425 were meant to walk on flat feet so that our body weight is distributed equally between the ball and the heel of the foot
4609426 when we wear heels 90 per cent of the weight is on the big toe joint
4609427 any shoe without proper support for your feet can cause them to roll inward
4609428 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
4609429 i cant lovin nobody but you for all my life
4609430 why do they get mad if i dont let them be a man and change the battery
4609431 didnt miss me and what was going on with her that i was trying to be understanding of for her was that while biologically she needed a man she really resented men otherwise because shed been abused by men in childhood
4609432 sildenafil should not be used by individuals taking any type of nitrate drug due to the risk of developing potentially life threatening low blood pressure
4609433 anyone who has this product is advised not to use it and to consult their medical practitioner if they have any health concerns related to its use
4609434 patients taking any kind of alternative medical treatment should be aware of what the medication contains and the potential side effects involved and should inform their doctor they are taking the product
4609435 is your smile showing or hiding your teeth can you make a mad face how does your face look when you are sad
4609436 wow i didnt realize that she had cellulite and shes got a roll on her back i never noticed she doesnt look as good as i thought she would
4609437 mum we really appreciate you having katherine for the week but why did you let her have ten cups of tea and five oranges every day
4609438 in 1933 your grandpa would call me from his teaching post in ceduna when i was in robe
4609439 the connection was so bad that wed spend all two minutes of our precious monthly trunk call saying whaaaat
4609440 ah well kiddo at least im not in anyones way
4609441 i was going to get you a book for christmas but then i remembered youve already got one
4609442 i know its a lovely building but even fifty years later i hate it because all of my exams were held in there
4609443 it makes me remember a nice young chap who played our church organ in 1946 i now realise that he must have been careful pause a homosexual and he eventually left i dont think anyone really made him feel as though he was welcome or belonged and ill always regret that i didnt know enough to do so either
4609444 as she develops more skills i lose more of mine
4609445 is this ok grandpa if it is ill keep doing it it might make the rest of it his emaciated body gasping breaths milky eyes shudders of pain seem further away
4609446 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4609447 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4609448 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4609449 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4609450 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4609451 o importante foi a festa embora tivesse gostado de ver o benfica vencer
4609452 gostei como gostei do benfica frente ao feyenoord pena gostava que a ta a ficasse em portugal mas a equipa est bem est a corresponder ao futebol que o treinador gosta
4609453 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
4609454 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4609455 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4609456 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4609457 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4609458 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4609460 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
4609461 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
4609462 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4609463 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4609464 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

4609466 im sorry kai i tried to quit i really did but its too hard
4609467 sorry im in the middle of the road between bundaberg and rockhampton
4609468 so the receptions not so good and there are trucks everywhere
4609469 sorry what im living the rock dream im living the something dream thats for sure
4609470 we found so many awesome bands we get so many cds when we run these competitions and everyones really keen and we build up a database of cool bands that we can call up next time if we cant get them this time
4609471 see i reckon thats the thing getting a show getting into a good venue any way you can i love the bands that just give it a go thats really heartening
4609472 i reckon youre the first journo whos said that and i totally agree
4609473 i reckon its a really fun record were just having a great time and i reckon you picked up on that its got a lot of energy it was really fun writing it really fun recording it and its really fun playing it thats definitely the vibe and we didnt mean for it to be like that but it is you know
4609474 no i agree its a really straightforward riff and that can sound really shit and it did sound shit at one stage but we massaged it and added the key change because it really needed it and it turned into a really uplifting version of a pretty straightforward semi classic riff
4609475 they happen but not with too much analysis or time spent on it its more like one day hey deano how about we try this for the next album yeah cool alright
4609476 we tend to move forward pretty quickly and get on with the next project i think we instinctively know what we want to do next and are very in synch as a band theres not much deliberation
4609477 but for this tour we had to re learn some of the old songs which meant going back over the old albums and so it really struck me recently that weve done a lot of stuff and it feels good
4609478 theres a sense of satisfaction that ive never felt before and thats a nice feeling
4609479 the sort of papers i read would probably refer to me as a gym slip mummy
4609480 theres not much difference between looking bored and looking rehabilitated
4609481 people are dying to get out of this town is it that much worse to kill
4609482 miss dunn we are living in an age of consent
4609483 instead of just seeing a theatre show or seeing one singer perform the audience can expect a whole range of different things
4609484 im hoping that its going to raise the profile of the performers and excite sydneysiders in europe you see theyre brought up with this culture of theatre and burlesque and all these amazing things but in australia ive found were not as cultured were not brought up with the arts as much which is really sad
4609485 i want dollies and soldiers to capture peoples attention and get into peoples heads that they want to go to the theatre they want to go watch shows and they dont want to just sit at home and watch tv and play xbox
4609486 my mate went to sydney and all i got was this lousy t shirt
4609487 this is the most difficult decision zoo professionals have to make
4609488 but we are confident that we made the right one frank lived a good long life but he just wore out
4609489 frank was a great father four of his daughters have proven to be excellent moms one of which even adopts those not her own frank too in addition to being an excellent father served as a surrogate dad and often took in babies that were hand raised and needed to be reintroduced to other gorillas
4609490 thats one of the reasons he earned chicago magazines father of the year in 1998
4609491 frank is definitely part of the history and fabric of the louisville zoo and gorilla forest
4609492 its a very difficult time for the zoo especially for those of us who worked with frank every day he will be greatly missed by us and the entire community
4609493 my wife and i we just celebrated 48 years and i met her at the fair its a great place to be and a great place to meet girls
4609494 we used to bring all the grandkids but theyre too big theyre teenagers and wouldnt want to be seen with us
4609495 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4609496 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4609497 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4609498 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4609499 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4609500 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4609501 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4609502 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4609503 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4609504 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4609505 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4609506 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4609507 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4609508 who are open to doing something on the production side
4609509 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4609510 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4609511 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4609512 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4609513 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4609514 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4609515 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4609516 we feel terrible for izzy we have to move on but hes an important part of what weve done
4609517 people are enthusiastic they enjoy getting out and getting some fresh air and some of them enjoy the competitive side of it between each other or just for themselves
4609518 i really put the right energy in but i wasnt enough aggressive enough there was a little too much fear
4609519 its proof that you dont need to be in a huge amazing facility you dont need to be one of 10 million
4609520 you just have to be one person doing the work thats all it takes
4609521 weve been told before there are a million chinese weightlifters
4609522 i mean in canada we have maybe a couple hundred and theyve got a great feeder program weve heard a lot about leading up to the olympics i think theyre just in another league
4609523 every time we see a patient that was delayed we always agonize a little bit
4609524 we do see a lot of people in the er and it turns out not to be a heart attack
4609525 but if you are having the big one you want to figure it out right away
4609526 chest pain is not something you triage over the phone
4609527 ive said earlier and throughout the whole season if we showed up with a team we had a really good record
4609528 we have really good girls and a really solid core of guys that get along really well and our two pickups we made for the playoffs are very solid players too
4609529 it gave us a little more confidence because i think our first three innings all of our guys popped up but all of our girls were on base
4609530 if we have a team here we will feel good
4609531 the linux foundation has published a how to document for developers who want to
4609532 were trying to reach out to hoosier families to do science and math and other technologies and we need to do that because were going back to the moon and to mars and so we need these kids to get into these schools so we can use their skills in the work force
4609533 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4609538 li es poesia de acci n en movimiento una pena que estropeen nuestras palomitas con una historia tan lacrim gena

4609540 spread the message to as many individuals in as many places as possible simply reminding them of their beauty
4609541 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4609542 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4609543 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4609544 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4609545 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4609546 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4609547 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4609548 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4609549 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4609550 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4609551 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4609552 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4609553 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4609554 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4609555 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4609556 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4609557 the thunderstorm with rotation has moved out of the warned area

4609560 pretty safe to assume that nintendo will continue to lead the
4609561 are the biggest single countries that provide a challenge to the u s
4609562 i would say they are closely matched in terms of capability and programming to be able to induce an attack against the u s through the internet
4609563 because this type of attack requires the browser to interact with the already local activex plug in there are basically two ways to eliminate these kinds of issues one fix the vulnerable plug in or two tell the browser to stop talking to it the kill bit does the latter
4609564 microsoft seems to be stepping up to the plate by issuing kill bits for
4609565 the gag order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on the students right to speak
4609566 they informed mbta of their findings they were planning to withhold information that would allow people to exploit the system

4609569 the town of smooth in the state of well educated
4609570 well i am only trying to sell to people who want to buy
4609571 are you really serious about making a decision or are you just looking for information right now
4609572 what is the time frame and decision process you are going to go through
4609573 who besides yourself is going to be involved in the process
4609574 the talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4609575 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4609576 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4609577 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4609578 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4609579 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4609580 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe

4609587 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4609588 there is a reasonable chance that we will see something in the next congress
4609589 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion
4609590 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4609591 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
4609592 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability
4609593 i am a layman thankful to his church anchored by his faith and his humble background

4609597 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4609598 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4609599 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4609600 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4609601 obstructions and incidents that militated against realisation of full potential of the country in terms of crude oil production
4609602 maintained at an average of two million barrels per day
4609603 it was very disturbing a few weeks ago when for the first time nigerias daily oil production dropped to below 1 8 million barrels per day
4609604 we are dealing with two opposing forces the scientific power of food production and biologic power of human reproduction

4609610 smaller deep water culture systems are less work than soil gardens since there is obviously no soil to till as well as no weeds to pull since there is no soil you neednt worry about soil born diseases either hydroponics uses only a small fraction of the water a soil garden requires there is no water wasted or stolen by weeds since it is you that is providing the needed nutrients you can be sure that the plants receive the exact amount they need this causes them to grow more rapidly while also producing bigger yields its been shown that hydroponic systems produce is much higher in nutritional value than ordinary crops grown in fields it is also thought to tastes better than field grown produce as well you can grow your plants on a year round basis when growing indoors with led grow lights or in a greenhouse with their grow lights so as you can see hydroponic growing is perfect for the hobby gardener or the farmer growing crops such as tomatoes cucumbers and peppers leafy crops like lettuce and herbs and flowing plants

4609642 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member

4609678 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4609679 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4609680 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4609681 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4609682 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4609683 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4609684 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4609685 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4609686 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4609687 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4609688 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4609689 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence

4609709 we can coordinate those things and save a lot of extra trips and time and also money
4609710 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4609711 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4609720 we are going to review it and then be in discussions with the attorney generals office
4609721 if i think there is enough there to warrant investigation i will send it to the attorney general
4609722 it is really a question of whether they were speaking on the video in their capacity as elected officials or as private citizens
4609723 as we told the review board and as it said in the presentation the individuals were speaking as private citizens and expressing a personal opinion
4609724 whatever the regulators need we will be happy to comply with
4609725 the board is going to maintain its focus on the quality of the proposals and the questions the legislature has asked us answer
4609726 it doesnt disqualify them at all as one board member i am going to look at the quality of the proposal from all the applicants
4609727 if the presentation violated the law then law enforcement officials will take care of that
4609728 ive been excited about playing here for so long im ready
4609729 i feel pretty good right now my availability will be however denis decides to use me that might not be at all but if it is ill be ready
4609730 its been a long summer with the negotiations going on
4609731 im just excited that we were able to come to terms
4609732 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4609733 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4609734 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4609735 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4609736 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4609737 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4609738 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4609739 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4609740 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4609741 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4609742 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4609743 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4609744 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4609745 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4609746 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4609747 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4609748 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4609749 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4609750 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4609751 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4609752 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4609753 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4609754 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4609755 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4609756 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4609757 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4609758 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4609759 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4609760 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4609761 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4609762 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4609763 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4609764 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4609765 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4609766 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4609767 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4609768 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4609769 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4609770 we hebben het laten analyseren en experts zijn er behoorlijk zeker van dat het dateert uit de tijd van christus geboorte
4609771 mccains tech plan reads like some crotchety technophobe knocked over the bumper sticker wrack at an ayn rand reading revival and tried to rearrange them so it made a policy
4609772 seriously this is approaching chuck norris level aggrandizement how delusional does this guy have to be to imagine himself the hero of every situation hes in to the point that he has to frame himself as a white knight on regulating packet shaping over the internet im actually kind of impressed here are the rest of the sub headings they are of course not about technology they are about john mccain
4609773 the mccain worldview scares the hell out of me technology is complicated and the solutions we need are fairly complex they require an in depth understanding of the problem if youre going to formulate a solution and mccain clearly doesnt understand some of the core problems im still waiting for mccain to release a real technology plan one that helps consumers and addresses the problems were facing instead of protecting corporations and ignoring technology market failings
4609774 mccain has delivered his tech policy and its clear this election will determine whether america willfully becomes a third world participant in the online economy and culture
4609775 we have already had 16 months of no policy in the technology realm and an admitted lack of knowledge by the candidate himself now the campaign cant even get the basics straight on something they absolutely should know the candidates own record
4609776 mccain declines to put net neutrality into law indeed he declines to guarantee all americans the right to obtain the information they want communicate to everyone they want send non obscene and lawful information to anyone they want over the internet why whats the hold up why not assure this paradigm
4609777 we see that millions of americans are using the internet to help each other out and to improve the way government works the obama technology plan encourages civic engagement and openness unfortunately the mccain plan adopts the bush cheney approach which promotes privileges for big companies at the expense of democracy
4609778 where obama has specifics and new ideas mccain has old ideas and positions that would be taken for granted in any administration other than the one now ending the reason is that mccain has a problem hes out of step with the real world
4609779 you stupid bitch if it wasnt for his father none of us would be here tonight and you wouldnt be doing what it is you do
4609780 its making me a little bit nervous and i dont get nervous very often

4609788 im elated that this program is providing needy families with access to basic cell phone service
4609789 our study showed cell phones can significantly boost the earning potential of these communities and this connectivity vastly encourages their opportunities and remains central to their everyday survival
4609790 this program will allow drivers to call 911 if they encounter an emergency or get stranded while on the road
4609791 i am thrilled that tennessee is the first state in the country to offer this program and help keep our citizens safe
4609792 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4609793 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter

4609796 i look forward to being a part of the d c united family and to representing the club to the best of my ability
4609797 ryan has several dimensions that frankly other drivers dont have
4609798 clearly his technical ability and we all knows he stands on the gas
4609799 hes an engaging guy i like ryan almost as a son to tell you the truth because i saw him come out of purdue but at the same token when youve got the surrounding cast in place and thats not changing itll make the transition that much more efficient
4609800 weve been around a long time and were going to keep going
4609801 you go out and find another teammate that can give just as much to the program as he did
4609802 i had great teammates before like with matt kenseth at roush racing you always look for teammates because that type of camaraderie helps the team continue to chug along
4609803 the guy wins the daytona 500 in february and by august hes going to a different team
4609804 i really enjoy what ive found here at penske racing
4609805 are we running to the best of our ability no we need to get better and so this a fresh start with a new driver will help that
4609806 weve got to get somebody in there that can drive right away
4609807 do you look for a guy with a one or two year deal or do you look for a guy that can sign a long term type contract younger guy older guy weve interviewed them all were trying to find just the best fit
4609808 were not prepared to disclose who the driver is yet were working on a couple of things but i expect well be making an announcement here in the near term
4609809 we had good dialogue ryan came to us and asked for the opportunity to see what was out there i mean thats only fair he felt he had a better opportunity elsewhere we had good dialogue and he chose to exercise that option on his part
4609810 one of the great things about that no 12 team is thats essentially been the same crew for ryans entire career
