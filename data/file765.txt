7650000 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7650001 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7650002 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7650003 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7650004 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7650005 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7650006 all teams have three or four goalkeepers and every goalkeeper tries to be the best i am ready for this challenge and it is normal
7650007 if i play for hearts i have a chance to go back into the national team but i have to be playing for the team
7650008 tiago is a wonderful lad an exemplary professional and if he remains i would happily accept it
7650009 september is a few days away thankfully and the transfer window will close
7650010 has he asked to speak to me he hasnt spoken to me about these things he talks with the club about it
7650011 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7650012 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7650013 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7650014 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7650015 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7650016 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7650017 this we hope since many of our commuters are from ashburn will free up some space there
7650018 some number of people are going to be involved in serious or fatal crashes that didnt need to be because they had no place to go when they broke down or no place to go when they had a fender bender
7650019 common sense tells you if you have a place to go when you break down where other cars arent driving its safer everyone knows that you can get studies to justify almost anything this is a study to justify the unjustifiable
7650020 some number of people are going to be involved in serious or fatal crashes that didnt need to be because they had no place to go when they broke down or no place to go when they had a fender bender
7650021 common sense tells you if you have a place to go when you break down where other cars arent driving its safer everyone knows that you can get studies to justify almost anything this is a study to justify the unjustifiable
7650022 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association
7650023 i called richard johnson editor of the ny posts page 6 gossip column and challenged him but he didnt accept i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
7650024 forse lillusione che attraverso la rete dei blog si potesse creare una sorta di contro cultura o di contro letteratura forse questa diffusa stanchezza che promana dalla rete il segno di qualche illusione disvelata di qualche piccolo sogno infranto forse la sgradita coscienza che tutto questo scintillante ambaradan era in fondo soltanto un gioco
7650025 the lightning was too close we evacuated the senior patio and had students go inside
7650026 several cinder blocks were blown apart and strewn over the patio
7650027 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7650028 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7650029 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7650030 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7650031 having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7650032 they recognize that there are no good military options but they also recognize that it is from their perspective it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon
7650033 the question is what kind of legal remedies are out there that can satisfy the government of iraqs desire to hold individuals accountable in a proper way but will also guarantee the person that is charged with the western style legal due process that he grew up with
7650034 always abides by the laws and regulations in the countries where they work and will continue to do so
7650035 with regard to the immunity issue the key to success for security contractors working in iraq is a properly crafted status of forces agreement
7650036 at this time the company will wait and see what is agreed upon by the u s and iraqi governments and evaluate the situation
7650037 confident that it will meet all of its contractual obligations
7650038 it would be difficult to recruit people if they could be tried before an iraqi court
7650039 i cant see us being able to recruit people who might have to make life and death decisions if they knew that they could be prosecuted in iraq in what could be a highly charged atmosphere
7650040 some of them will look at this new agreement and say i can live with this
7650041 some of them will look at that new agreement and say i cant live with that i am going to go some people will say i saw what happened the first time and i can no longer live with that we just dont know
7650042 some men see things as they are and ask why
7650043 i think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsman and farmers didnt notice it
7650044 we just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows
7650045 most of them actually align in a north south direction
7650046 its a very clever use of google earth and the evidence is quite compelling it does seem that these animals are detecting the earths magnetic field and using it to point in a north south direction
7650047 i was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north facing cows and deer it was really intriguing
7650048 it was very imaginative it demonstrates yet again all the unexpected uses of and value of digital geospatial data
7650049 start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer to see how that affects them
7650050 thats one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense
7650051 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil

7650060 hillary clinton was doggedly determined to see this through to the end others may have quit but she didnt
7650061 i think that determination you can still find among some of her supporters itll take a little longer because of that
7650062 her campaign was unprecedented the level of support that she was able to achieve was terrific
7650063 and there was a lot of passion and energy that was tied up in her campaign and she has said if you believed in me then you must believe in sen obama it might take a little time for some people to come around

7650066 i think in truth this is not the most technical circuit
7650067 the reality is it was very close between felipe and lewis and quite close between heikki and kimi i personally wont draw too many conclusions from that the best philosophy for us is to assume were behind and we had better make our car quicker before the next race
7650068 we turned the engine down before the end of the race and we wanted a solid performance given that he wasnt on sparking form yesterday due to his neck problem he did all that was asked of him and he did the same today no risks he scored the points and extended his lead in the championship
7650069 i think were all learning lewis is learning and were still learning i think hes getting stronger mentally hes been in one championship fight and hes now in another one im sure he will learn throughout this one just as he did from the last one
7650070 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now and the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now which means if youre a corporation deciding where to do business youre starting to think beijing looks like a pretty good option
7650071 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7650072 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions
7650073 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed

7650077 my goal with this entry is to brush a big picture of where linux stands as far as photography is concerned
7650078 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7650079 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7650080 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7650081 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7650082 the only way theyd be prohibited to live near a school or playground or where theres children of interest is if theyre on probation or parole
7650083 all we do is work with our transportation personnel and our parents to notify them law enforcement theres not a whole lot more we can do than that
7650084 la nostra economia incredibilmente produttiva ci richiede di elevare il consumismo al nostro stile di vita di trasformare lacquisto e luso di merci in rituale di far si che la nostra realizzazione personale e spirituale venga ricercata nel consumismo abbiamo bisogno che sempre pi beni vengano consumati distrutti e rimpiazzati ad un ritmo sempre maggiore
7650085 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7650086 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7650087 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music

7650109 i find him inexperienced i find him insincere we have an unqualified candidate who has little more than empty rhetoric and a lot of money at his disposal
7650110 we are very happy that chace has decided to enroll at unlv
7650111 he is an outstanding young man who is extremely versatile on the court he shoots the ball well from the perimeter but is also very active in slashing to the goal during his redshirt season his efforts against our eligible players will make for very competitive practices

7650118 the suspect grabbed the elderly mans backpack and rode off with it
7650119 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom

7650136 its a sad tale the closing of the venerable brakspear brewery in henley on thames where the most famous and surely the best bitter in england has been made for centuries the brewery in operation since 1779 was sold off in 2002 in parts to make room for an upscale hotel and everyone who worked there was let go without so much as a by your leave but for beer lovers the closing was not a complete disaster thankfully the master brewer at brakspear peter scholey determined to strike out on his own peter has set up shop as ridgeway brewing not so far from henley and already hes putting out beers so good they could almost make you forget brakspear altogether

7650187 in the old days here there used to be a lot of grandstanding but a lot of it was for show i can remember one day x came out onto the floor and he saw a piece that he did not like and he started jumping up and down on it and he bashed it all in and yelling and screaming and then he said now throw it out because its not good for anything and when he turned around he winked at me it was a show it was fun it was a game it was just like a john wayne movie as soon as the movie was over with they became human again
7650188 if your boss catches you out catches something wrong with the product in your area you can respond in one of two ways
7650189 my brother who is an accountant says he cannot believe this place that it is like a game instead of a workplace but he thinks everything about this place is ridiculous
7650190 mind you he was a fine fellow outside he used to tell me that he kept his leopard skin suit in the guard house and would put it on when he come in in the past if you wanted to get ahead you had to do a little more of the 2x4 the idea was if you did not beat you go beaten
7650191 i prefer the straightforward approach i dont like the foul language but i do not think people listen to you if you are a nice guy i dont think people listen to the assistant plant manager as much as they used to people are scared of someone who chews them out
7650192 it is a big game to get the other guy there is a lot of resentment and competition we base everything on results and so people will resort to things like counting back on the line including items made on the production line but not packed or dispatched as shift output to get a better count for their shift sometimes the foreman will lock up his tools so that the other people on the next shift will not get them we have to do process books to make sure things like tools and materials are exchanged otherwise people start breaking into each others lockers rivalry is good but you have to keep the lid on
7650193 i knew everything about the machines in my area and i used to turn up the speed on the line for brief periods of time so that my boys could produce more units than the other shift sometimes the foreman from the other shift would sneak in early to make sure i was not going on overtime but i just knew to regulate the line and get things done faster and i had everyone behind me my boys loved to do it that way they loved to shove it in their the other shifts face
7650194 it was really incredible how one unit pits itself against another in this place it is as if there is a wall at the end of each unit and anything that passes through that wall is no longer a problem for that unit people pass things along because there is always pressure to deliver the numbers despite all the lip service about quality being most important if you do not get the number you get nothing
7650195 ive had it solid with that 2x 4 style it nullifies you you jus start covering ass and playing your cards close to the chest you collect a lot of excuses and you are ready to head them out if anything comes up so the problems never get solved
7650196 the biggest problem around here is that there is no trust no one wants to get blamed for anything so say the sealer goes bad and you know how to fix it but you do not fix it what you do is call maintenance or to call industrial engineering that way they get stuck with the problem and you do not get chewed up for it it could be that it was you fault that you guys screwed up to gum but you try to cover that up and get it pinned on maintenance and engineering for example if you had a big hole it might be something you could fix but if you fixed it too many times then it would become your responsibility you would pick up the job and you cant hold that job
7650197 this culture lying cheating and stealing is still important this is how they survive if someone gets on their back they say we know how to fix that lie cheat and steal there is not real progress there there is a recognition that it is a problem but to tell you the truth i think the assistant plant manager does it as well he lies cheats and steals to get the plant manager off his ass
7650198 the book records say we have a million dollars of obsolete material but before the last launch we shipped it out and it turned out to be 2 million dollars worth there are kitties all over the place foreman squirrel things away that they think they need foremen get hit over the head all the time for scrap so it is better to hide it away and call it lost stock i think i would do the same thing but it makes for a lot of waste in the system
7650199 another example is if you are running rough on certain parts of the line and defects come up someone will stamp it off so that it does not show up as a loss for our department that is dangerous it is just bad for the company we are more concerned about covering ass than quality or quantity we would rather run with one man less then we need to do the job properly we expect the repairmen to pick up the slack if the repair does not get it it goes out and the warranty gets it
7650200 another example are budget costs we all fight to keep down cost but maybe we are not fighting hard enough because costs are still way out of control but you know it is mostly the new supervisors whose budgets are way over if they understood the old system better they maybe would lie cheat and steal a little and would be better off old supervisors who know the ropes his budget will always be under the words make it sound bad but lying cheating and stealing is a system which has worked everyone watched what they spend and they stayed on their toes i do not see that the issue has to be changed unless it is hurting the plant most seasoned supervisors can keep it within limits

7650202 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7650203 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7650204 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7650205 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party

7650219 even the reports prepared by the ministry of social justice and empowerment and placed before parliament contain merely factual information received from states about registration and disposal of cases various administrative arrangements made for the function of the act and funds spent without any meaningful analysis of the performance of the states which could form the basis for making corrective interventions
7650220 under reporting of atrocities act cases is a very common phenomenon and therefore the decline in the number of registered cases does not provide a true picture of the incidence of atrocities
7650221 a large number of cases which deserve to be registered under protection of civil rights act or the scs amp sts prevention of atrocities act are not actually registered under these acts either due to ignorance of law or under pressure from the interested parties investigations in even those limited number of cases is often earned out in a slipshod manner and with considerable delay

7650248 there is so much competition within the formats that unless supermarkets make phenomenal changes they will eventually lose out to hypermarkets and small kirana stores
7650249 unlike earlier times when customers approached retail stores with a single point agenda today the basket size of shoppers has expanded with an increase in influence from other family members
7650250 while hypermarkets can afford to offer huge discounts and local kirana stores offer personalised services supermarkets do not provide either the only way the supermarkets can survive is by offering very good customer service to suit each customer profile
7650251 we want to avoid a situation where we are left with the same stake as the others and give away our sole operatorship
7650252 governmental approval for this share was given in july this year and there is no new information given after this approval we look forward to cooperate in this partnership
7650253 its good to be back and start the year weve had a lot of preparation and our players are ready to get in a game theyre tired of hitting each other which im sure is pretty consistent throughout the country weve had a good preseason practice the only injury worth talking about was william cole im sure everyone is aware of that otherwise were healthy were not going to name a backup quarterback prior to the game both guys have gotten better but there hasnt been one that has done anything in practice to distance himself from the other so were going to keep both of them with the same amount of reps theyve had the past weeks and go from there hopefully well be able to get some of those guys some experience before they have to be in a critical situation but we are comfortable with where theyre at and we are comfortable with the number of reps they have had but other than that were just looking forward to two more heavy practices then cutting back wednesday and thursday well travel to seattle thursday night and getting ready to play in a game
7650254 i think that we have to make sure we understand our game plan and not really worry about what they do because we dont really know what theyre going to do i think most coaches across the country think that there is going to be some consistency with what they were doing on offense because the majority of their staff is there but defensively theyre split up so we really dont have any idea what theyre going to do all we can do is prepare and do the best we can and make adjustments early in the game
7650255 kendall has two things that are very important in playing at this level and then taking it to the next level first being that hes very durable second being that hes not really concerned with his personal statistics hes more concerned about the team hes got both of those kendall needs to become a better receiver as a running back he needs to protect the ball better hell get a better feel for the offense and understand as he goes on he did a nice job last year as a true freshman but he still has a ways to go he does have the ability to make you miss and he can get in the open field and run away from you hes probably faster than what most people might think he and beau johnson will probably split reps this year
7650256 i think were better i think it has to do with the experience on your team the maturity and i also think it has to do with how good you are as a football team we were a better team later last year than we were earlier for two reasons the first reason was that dantrell savage wasnt playing earlier when he wasnt playing we werent as good i think the team we played last year to open the season was better than what people thought they were they had some youth and still have some good youth i was walking through my living room and i saw some college football preview on the television they listed their running back as the best running back in the country i think hes a pretty good player
7650257 weve been told that its the loudest stadium in the nfl and theyre supposed to have 55 000 fans there i was unaware of that they say that there is one particular end zone that because of the way its a partially closed structure its the loudest area in the nfl it will be a true road test for us if they have 50 000 fans there and were in a stadium that is pretty loud it will be a definite road test for us

7650295 sir i have found you an argument but i am not obliged to find you an understanding
7650296 no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money
7650297 essentially economic analysis consists of 1 an understanding of the categories of action and an understanding of the meaning of a change in values costs technological knowledge etc 2 a description of a situation in which these categories assume concrete meaning where definite people are identified as actors with definite objects specified as their means of action with definite goals identified as values and definite things specified as costs and 3 a deduction of the consequences that result from the performance of some specified action in this situation or of the consequences that result for an actor if this situation is changed in a specified way and this deduction must yield a priori valid conclusions provided there is no flaw in the very process of deduction and the situation and the change introduced into it being given and a priori valid conclusions about reality if the situation and situation change as described can themselves be identified as real because then their validity would ultimately go back to the indisputable validity of the categories of action
7650298 for it would be an absurd undertaking to banish from the language of economic theory every manner of speaking that is not literally correct it would be sheer pedantry to proscribe every figure of speech particularly since we could not say the hundredth part of what we have to say if we refused ever to take recourse to a metaphor

7650359 millions billions if they all sound like the same thing a big blurred thing on the evening news it is perhaps because they lack a sense of relative size that works on a human scale so one useful trick is to imagine those numbers instead as seconds a million seconds is about 11 5 days a billion seconds is nearly 32 years
7650360 lord teach me to number my days that i might have a heart of wisdom
7650361 on one occasion when i was in one of the prayer meetings some of the attendees asked if i wanted them to pray for me i told them no because i did not see that god answered their prayers
7650362 on further reading of my bible it struck me that their prayers were not answered because they did not comply with the conditions upon which god had promised to answer prayer they did not pray in faith in the sense of expecting god to give them the thing for which they asked
7650363 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home
7650364 not to separate themselves from the democratic party but because thats where their constituents are you dont find your constituents in denver and these are important days
7650365 im sure that there are some that are intentionally staying away just as a symbolic indicator of their independence
7650366 there are some very stark parallels between hip hop and the negro leagues
7650367 nobody gave the negro leagues a chance but it lasted 40 years
7650368 its important in that the individuals were asking to work on the projects they need to see that theres a reason for it that goes beyond ego goes beyond making money goes beyond spending for marketing everything needs to be multifaceted now
7650369 when you started talking about buck oneil here was a man who knew charlie parker and ll cool j he was excited about this project for a man well into his 90s he never lost touch he was comfortable in any environment and had an appreciation for all art forms hip hop rock and roll in his estimation it was all jazz all jazz
7650370 the struggle for rap and urban music to be accepted in the music industry was similar to black players being acknowledged as players and not black people
7650371 theres a big gap between young people today understanding this and understanding how their struggles paralleled
7650372 we want them to make news based upon good things as opposed to a shootout at a club
7650373 one of the things we talked about was approaching young people about the project
7650374 how many times in your life do you truly have a chance to make history
7650375 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7650376 are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy
7650377 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7650378 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7650379 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7650380 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7650381 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7650382 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7650383 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7650384 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up
7650385 and he understands the speed its going to be a whole lot faster when we play the jets the first game of the season
7650386 getting devean back in a mavs uniform has been a goal of ours all summer
7650387 his experience and ability to run the floor and play and defend multiple positions will be a great asset for us this season

7650408 i was first traveling to oregon to look at colleges for my son
7650409 we are all participants in the creation of the world and we should be aware of what we are colluding with or what we are resisting
7650410 im a shiksa trying to look like an orthodox woman
7650411 so long as little children are allowed to suffer there is no true love in this world
7650412 when you lose an nfl player thats a pretty big hit
7650413 however were excited about the depth we have there to go along with the play making ability those guys bring
7650414 i think our defensive line right now with the playing experience and the physical maturity of our starters is probably as deep as we have been since ive been head coach here
7650415 each of the starting four has improved i think their performance as a group is pretty dynamic
7650416 nick schommer has started a number of games at free safety which we say is the quarterback position of our defense
7650417 nick plays the deep middle really well and is an aggressive sure handed tackler thats a great combination
7650418 last year cornerback was a position where we were extremely thin

7650423 we are very excited to see this response from the western new york community as well as the great support we are receiving on campus for our football program
7650424 western new york is truly a passionate sports community that strongly supports its teams that are giving them value we feel that since coach gill has arrived we are putting an exciting and affordable product on the field that can make both our alumni and western new york proud to be a part of

7650426 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
7650427 i said okay john im going to support you because i thought if he could get the nomination he would be president and i think he will be president
7650428 so i said i just want one thing from you john
7650429 yeah maybe if we had a piece of paper and wrote down our preferences it might not be in either party mccain or democratic nominee sen
7650430 or maybe i didnt it depends on how the polls swing
7650431 john used to harass me because i would get earmarks or pork barrel projects in mississippi
7650432 and i would say well yes john im a senator from mississippi and were the poorest state in the nation
7650433 but you know what in my heart i knew he was right
7650434 it got out of control with republicans and thats why we are being punished a little bit
7650435 because we forgot how we got there what we believed in the principles that after 30 years put us in the majority gave us the white house the congress the senate the house and then we ran out of ideas
7650436 but that was an aberration thats not who we really are
7650437 his waiver of appellate rights was involuntary and unknowing because he entered into the plea agreement unaware of the potential six level official victim enhancement
7650438 how to make money online with ebay yahoo and google
7650439 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
7650440 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
7650441 they see where its grown with their own eyes and pick it with their own hands they dont need a sign in a store to tell them how fresh it is
7650442 wouldnt pay us what we needed to break even and make a little money
7650443 the you pick is the reason ive been able to do this for so long
7650444 most people who go out to pick fruits and vegetables use it as a recreational activity so youll get all kinds of customers on the weekend and no one on wednesday
7650445 its a cheap way to get exercise entertainment and food with little cost the trick is getting the customer to come out and pick versus when the crop is actually ready
7650446 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7650447 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7650448 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7650449 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7650450 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7650451 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7650452 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7650453 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7650454 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7650455 these areas are host to some of the worlds most bio diverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans

7650461 why be a man when you can be a success
7650462 an intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows
7650463 where did all the papers go that were on top of the dresser
7650464 in a plastic bag in the top drawer of the filing cabinet
7650465 theyre in the closet on top of the green hamper
7650466 we have an abundance of experience back with our skilled positions whether it would be our wide receivers or our tight ends or our running backs people that touch the football with the exception of quarterback thats really encouraging
7650467 if there is a place where we are thin and unproven its at quarterback
7650468 we feel nick mertens is a very capable player and showed good things over the course of spring football but it will be fun to see him go out there and compete against our incoming competition
7650469 i think the toughest thing to do as a quarterback is when you have the football and its third down and long weve been successful and avoided those situations as much as possible
7650470 i think tyler roehl emerged and a lot of people really didnt know much about him we felt like he was always very capable
7650471 certainly it was great to see him put up some of the yardage he did but tyler is such an unselfish player i dont think he will be looking for postseason accolades or how many yards he gets hes looking for how far our team will go
7650472 on the offensive line were a little bit bigger and stronger and fairly experienced however we did lose several starters
7650473 de vraag naar onze dienstverlening is de afgelopen jaren sterk gegroeid en zal dat in de komende jaren ook zeker blijven doen wij staan bekend om de hoge mate van betrokkenheid bij onze klanten met een vestiging in amsterdam kruipen we nog dichter aan tegen bestaande en nieuwe opdrachtgevers in die regio bovendien willen wij op die manier ook de arbeidsmarkt in deze regio aanboren
7650474 de afgelopen jaren hebben we keihard maar gelukkig ook met veel plezier gewerkt om van 2organize en inbetween het succes te maken dat het nu is we zien echter nog volop kansen om oxyma group en haar merken in nederland n daarbuiten nog beter op de kaart te zetten het openen van de vestiging in amsterdam is daarbij slechts een eerste stap
7650475 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7650476 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7650477 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7650478 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7650479 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7650480 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7650485 chips on you dud you got bugged for being near me viruses transmit that way you know
7650486 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum
7650487 q how many bush administration officials does it take to change a light bulb a none there is no need to change anything we made the right decision to stick with that light bulb people who say that it is burned out are giving aid and encouragement to the forces of darkness
7650488 red meat wont hurt you fuzzy blue green meat will
7650489 we are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the child at play
7650490 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all
7650491 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide
7650492 meanwhile you are the ugliest pigfucker in the universe you are the
7650493 it just means so much to my family that photo and it means so much that it was picked
7650494 we all have that picture in our homes and my brother even has it tattooed on his back its that special
7650495 i would have loved to walk out of here with a championship trophy on a white horse and all that but it didnt work out that way
7650496 but im proud of the fact that when i got here the organization was in shambles and when i left it was in a good place
7650497 this guy would make a nice afl player and he reminds me a lot of barry wagner
7650498 i think any time you have to get it right and get another look at it and slow it down it should always be good
7650499 if its going to make the officials get it right its a good thing
7650500 theyre always so busy i mean shouldnt you guys be preparing for the rapture arent you leaving soon
7650501 but you got style and you got class but most of all you
7650502 if youre bringing on people who need assistance younger kids all at once you potentially create a bottleneck on the front end as opposed to randomly dispersing them based on where people are sitting in the aircraft
7650503 should airlines have a section of the plane reserved for parents with babies and younger children
7650504 china vs tibet vs the media vs a world wide collective conscience
7650505 where can i get a decent cheeseburger up in this mutha
7650506 or theyll let you into their lives and use you like its nothing
7650507 then youve got the other kind the gorgeous girls that dont know theyre gorgeous
7650508 and they do this because they dont understand that they deserve better which is the part that always blows me away
7650509 everywhere there are women who i would treat like gold a thousand of them will probably read this and wish they could have someone like me but theyll all be in relationships already and even though itd be so simple to just just be with me instead theyll stay with their asshole boyfriends because thats what theyre conditioned to do they dont know you know and its jarring when youre a guy youre alone and you know thats not what you deserve but here we are its friday night now right
7650510 okay so its saturday night and youre in here with me and really we should both be out there
7650511 but the gorgeous girls are either with the assholes or the rich assholes and yet somehow we end up being the assholes in all this
7650512 pretty standard i guess married at twenty divorced at thirty five they were both around most of the time except when they were working or getting into screaming matches they were really good about keeping the arguments away from my porcelain ears theyd usually go out to restaurants and fight there so i didnt have to hear one month i think they spent over two thousand dollars on dinner due to the sheer amount of times they went out to fight
7650513 i have to think that if there were more balance in the world people would be far less inclined to commit crimes can you imagine a world where if you held up and robbed a store your very own home would be held up and robbed later that week by the very same people who you robbed earlier im willing to bet that anyone with half a brain would think twice before robbing anyone
7650514 he was shot two days ago hes alive but unconscious do you know anything about that
7650515 let me ask you something randy have you ever noticed that most albums end with the saddest song
7650516 if you buy a random album the odds are almost guaranteed that the saddest song on the album will be the last song its usually the slowest if theres a waltz thats where youll find it the song thats full of heartbreak and emotion and all that other stuff its almost always the last song on the album why do you think that is why do so many musicians feel the need to leave us on such a sad note so often
7650517 now a musician isnt going to make a big splash when he writes about something happy
7650518 theyve got their real emotions on the line theyre trying to get their damage out on paper because theyre thinking that at least if this doesnt make the hate and the fear and the heartbreak go away then hey maybe they can make some megabucks for their trouble so these are in theory their strongest arguments each one is a desperate plea for love and understanding and where do these songs go
7650519 they go to the end of the album they want to finish on their strongest note literally
7650520 for someone who wanted to hurry this process along you certainly seem to do a fair job of distracting from the issue
7650521 we think you might have an idea as to who was involved did anyone ever say anything to you about him
7650522 i dont know anything about walter reed what led you to me anyway
7650523 we spoke with a woman yesterday and she said you might have some idea
7650524 however she seemed insistent that youre the man we need to talk to in order to get information now can you help us or not
7650525 but i wish you both the best of luck in catching the bastard who did it
7650526 i was hanging out with my friends and then this black guy walked up
7650527 on a positive note they very very rarely execute people they abduct
7650528 theyre usually held for just a week at a time before theyre released
7650529 veeee sa the ohhh ficial cahhhd of theee o leeeee mpic games ahnd the ohhhnly cahhhd accepted they uhhh
7650530 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
7650531 john edwards affair on his cancer stricken wife and fred barons apparent attempt to silence edwards mistress by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on her reeks of the arrogance of two multimillionaire plaintiffs attorneys trying to buy the white house
7650532 lets hold a press conference and clear this thing up once and for all
7650533 i credit fred and freds energy with helping get the state democratic party back on the road to revival
7650534 its something he did not have to do and most certainly in my view he did it based on his own belief system that they needed to be a viable state party
7650535 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
7650536 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
7650537 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
7650538 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
7650539 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
7650540 ldl cholesterol levels below 2 80 mmol l and levels of at least 3 90 mmol l were both associated with markedly elevated risk of cancer among patients who did not use statins
7650541 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7650542 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7650543 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7650544 it may be safe for women who have taken oral anticoagulants for 5 7 months after an unprovoked venous thromboembolism to discontinue therapy if they have 0 or 1 of the following 1 hyperpigmentation brown discoloration edema swelling or redness of either leg 2 a d dimer level blood clotting test of 250ug l or more while taking warfarin 3 bmi body mass index 30kg m2 and aged 65 years or more
7650545 it appears all men are at high risk of recurrence
7650546 furnishing selling alcohol to a minor contributing to the delinquency of a minor and annoying or molesting a child
7650547 we were talking about you because we just read the article about your group in one of the gay magazines
7650548 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7650549 the sale of york furthers kingsways strategy of focusing its resources on its core lines of business such as non standard automobile and trucking
7650550 we will use the proceeds of this transaction to retire our remaining short term debt and to support future growth opportunities in our core business lines
7650551 for us this is a first major step in an area where we want to intensify and develop our capacity as a place in the world that is renowned for clean renewable energy
7650552 our operation in becancour could be very significant and this site has the potential to support our proposed growth plans for quite some time in the future
7650553 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7650554 given the short term inflexibility inherent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first budgetary deficit in over a decade
7650555 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7650556 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7650557 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on
7650558 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7650559 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7650560 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7650561 after a number please let me know this is small but annoying now that youve pointed it out
7650562 whats coming up for onensemble ume in the middle is typed as
7650563 can i find any performances or events near my time off on saturdays
7650564 you have no control over what the other guy does you only have control over what you do
7650565 if everything seems under control youre just not going fast enough
7650566 the reason why worry kills more people than work is that more people worry than work
7650567 arent we forgetting the true meaning of christmas you know the birth of santa
7650568 the best christmas of all is the presence of a happy family all wrapped up with one another
7650569 other things may change us but we start and end with family
7650570 being defeated is often a temporary condition giving up is what makes it permanent
7650571 ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed
7650572 most of our obstacles would melt away if instead of cowering before them we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them
7650573 a ver yo no pongo mi cara delante de la vuestra intentar hacer lo mismo
7650574 natos secret armies operation gladio and terrorism in western europe
7650575 i have gone to prison because i did not want to reveal the existence of this super secret organization and now andreotti comes along and tells it to parliament
7650576 you had to attack civilians the people women children innocent people unknown people far removed from any political game
7650577 the reason was quite simple they were supposed to force these people the italian public to turn to the state to ask for greater security this is the political logic that lies behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened
7650578 could pass from a defensive post invasion logic to one of attack of civil war
7650579 those massacres those bombs those military actions had been organized or promoted or supported by men inside italian state institutions and as has been discovered more recently by men linked to the structures of united states intelligence
7650580 since this is a secret organization i wouldnt expect too many questions to be answered
7650581 if there were any links to terrorist organizations that sort of information would be buried very deep indeed
7650582 to the smallest possible coterie of the most reliable people in washington in nato
7650583 if it is not founded on truth on the full transparency of its institutions in regard to the dark plots against democracy that have turned upside down the history even in recent times of many european states
7650584 there will be no future ladies and gentlemen if we do not remove the idea of having lived in a kind of double state one open and democratic the other clandestine and reactionary
7650585 protests vigorously at the assumption by certain us military personnel at shape and in nato of the right to encourage the establishment in europe of a clandestine intelligence and operation network
7650586 a full investigation into the nature structure aims and all other aspects of these clandestine organizations or any splinter groups their use for illegal interference in the internal political affairs of the countries concerned and the problem of terrorism in europe

7650600 suvs are dangerous vehicles because they have a propensity to roll over they dont have to be dangerous but they are and they should be much safer than cars in the sense that they are bigger and heavier so when there are two car crashes theyre the more aggressive vehicle the occupant should be better off but the fact that they roll over with such frequency completely undermines their safety and when you have a rollover crash the likelihood of death or injury is enormous you are not going to walk away from that crash without any injury at all and more likely than not youre going to walk away with a severe injury
7650601 there is currently an insufficient body of data to judge the efficacy of such systems

7650617 the real id act then is about more than a drivers license it puts in place a set of standards for identity management idm that can be leveraged across an entire government organization to create an integrated citizen identity security program
7650618 no the government didnt have this stuff in place precisely because it had been working on it and knew its limitations and didnt find any value for the costs involved
7650619 its going to be hard to know how these technologies can be applied to increase national security were not just going to turn these machines on and start catching terrorists
7650620 a security flaw in passport canadas website has allowed easy access to the personal information including social insurance numbers dates of birth and drivers licence numbers of people applying for new passports

7650630 there is no doubt in my mind that a student could have a disability that would make processing in one modality difficulty so clearly that modality should be avoided
7650631 personally i find mr willinghams final comment at the end of the video both intriguing and almost analogous to yelling fire in a crowded movie theater as he remarks
7650632 good teaching is good teaching and teachers dont need to adjust their teaching to individual students learning styles
7650633 taken out of context clearly this comment could be entirely misconstrued to think that you only have to teach one way and that should cover it

7650639 for decades indian point has maintained that its cooling systems have no impact on hudson river fish
7650640 at long last the dec has pout an end to this fiction
7650641 this ruling actually gives us the opportunity to bring in the argument that this could impact electric power reliability in new york that the actual construction challenges may make it unfeasible
7650642 we still have to determine if building cooling towers is in the public interest
7650643 we are creating a source for irrigation that otherwise would not be used
7650644 every drop of water can make the land here potentially into agricultural land
7650645 with the depletion of the water table from the ground there are opportunities for saltier water to seep in and contaminate the fresh water
7650646 this is not a water crisis its a political crisis
7650647 this will stabilize the water situation in the medium and long term
7650648 the difference about today is that there are the technological tools to cope with this crisis
7650649 when people take responsibility and dont wait for rainfall alone we can assist nature and help find solutions
7650650 everything is absolutely on track i can look you in the eyes and tell you everything is on track
7650651 the closed beta has been expanding the open beta will come in autumn it will be announced by the home group either in london or tokyo i dont know when exactly but they are in control of it weve got more third parties on board and as far as i know its all on track
7650652 theres nothing sinister at all all ive heard about it is good news and im very close to it as its being developed in the next building
7650653 i like what im wearing but daddy doesnt so now i have to change
7650654 according to our calculations there are about 2 000 farmers who have not collected their cheques for the land acquired from them
7650655 of them some are absentee landlords and some whose plots are locked in disputes so almost all the marginal farmers and unregistered bargadars who have no other means of livelihood would have been rehabilitated in the market complex
7650656 we would have talked to the tatas and some of the ancillary units so that these farmers turned shopkeepers could have supplied them goods like gloves and uniforms
7650657 that way everything could have been taken care of only if mamata had agreed
7650658 we are glad that chiru has decided to enter politics we are confident he will weed out corruption from society like he does in his films
7650659 chiranjeevi has told his associates to ensure there are no deaths injuries or accidents at the rally
7650660 you see on a normal working day even walking along this stretch is a problem there are so many people around but look there is no one today
7650661 no one was stopped from entering the plant though the workers probably stayed away out of fear
7650662 the attendance of our employees was good and bare minimum work took place inside the plant
7650663 the company executives did some work at the effluent treatment plant lpg yard and training centre but no construction took place
7650664 we are welders but there hasnt been any work for us since saturday night so were just strolling around
7650665 the work schedule for almost all departments suffered today we dont know how long this will continue
7650666 we are open to all kinds of discussions with her everything can be talked about but we cannot miss this important project
7650667 it is not easy to carry on with peoples protest sitting on the roads at times it rains and causes problems then there are mosquitoes some big ones like malignant malaria mosquitoes and tata mosha tata mosquitoes
7650668 keeping the project intact in its entirety and staying within the existing legal and constitutional framework of the country we must find a mutually acceptable solution to protect the interests of farmers affected by land acquisition in singur so i want to have direct talks with you for speedy execution of the small car project and for the states image i hope you will call off your agitation and agree to have discussions
7650669 i am always willing to hold talks with the government in the interest of the state i am ready to participate in talks on the future of the unwilling farmers i welcome the chief ministers letter but will take part in discussions only if 400 acres are given back
7650670 entirety in bhattacharjees letter as applying to the mother plant alone minus the ancillary units
7650671 she had been arguing that the tatas need 600 650 acres for the small car plant and hence the ancillary units can be shifted to a nearby location buddhababus letter does not specifically state whether the entire project means both the mother plant and ancillary units and hence leaves scope for interpretation
7650672 of the 11 500 people whose land had been acquired in singur 9 500 gave it willingly unfortunately she is talking about the interests of a small section of farmers who did not accept cheques
7650673 two of our personnel deployed at the missionary hostel were beaten up by the activists and their two wheelers were burnt they sustained severe head injuries
7650674 all that has happened and is happening is certainly unfortunate and sad we are yet to get details of the incident but i would only like to say that such incidents are completely un christian and the religion does not approve of any kind of violence

7650784 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7650785 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7650786 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7650787 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7650788 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7650789 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7650790 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7650791 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7650792 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7650793 grin i ended up asking him to spell it for me he was very patient wouldnt ya know i came home and googled it i want one for christmas also has a new release this christmas you can watch him

7650810 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7650811 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial

7650829 ultimately its utterly unnecessary there are other ways of generating energy its not difficult to be slightly more efficient than the old power stations
7650830 in the same amount of time and for less money we could implement an energy system that will do far more to stop climate change and ensure energy security than nuclear or coal fired power a combination of renewables efficiency and combined heat and power

7650868 less than a month before elections its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
7650869 in this competition elections there are no enemies there are political opponents only with different political programes that will seek to attract the highest number of votes to conquer the power and exert it with legitimacy

7650880 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead

7650883 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7650884 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7650885 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7650886 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7650887 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7650888 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster

7650910 they took my music books and my daughters coloring books
7650911 im not going to be able to vote for anyone who doesnt take a 100 percent stand against abortion
7650912 i think most churches would say theres a great moral suasion behind it
7650913 in christianity for example as nervous as they might be about any particular civil order the new testament does say government was created by god most churches would say yes get out tuesday get out and vote
7650914 render unto god the things that are gods and render unto caesar the things that are caesars
7650915 part of being a citizen in a society like ours where we have the privilege of voting is the responsibility to exercise that privilege
7650916 to not do so is to sort of forego that part of what it means to be in a free society and i think it would be unfortunate
7650917 if you dont allow for situations like abstaining than you basically make the earthly political order into a kind of god the earthly political order is a good
7650918 they took my music books and my daughters coloring books
7650919 hes very committed to helping working class folks and poor people and thats what catholic social teaching is all about
7650920 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7650921 im a practicing catholic and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility
7650922 the only means by which in this heterogeneous society of ours we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and publicly charged debate
7650923 biden has opposed government funding for abortion so basically he doesnt want to put women and doctors in jail he doesnt want to criminalize abortions but nor does he want the government to pay for them
7650924 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions
7650925 im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7650926 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7650927 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7650928 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7650929 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7650930 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7650931 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7650932 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7650933 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7650934 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7650935 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7650936 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it

7650938 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices

7650974 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7650975 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying

7651020 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7651021 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7651022 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7651023 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7651024 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7651025 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7651026 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7651027 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design

7651030 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7651031 yes weve got to find solutions we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7651032 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7651033 people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it
7651034 most of the time anti piracy measures only hurt honest people
7651035 people who get sued will get more pissed and probably pirate more games
7651036 weve got to be willing to reach out and embrace virginians of all political stripes to join this campaign join this effort
7651037 what we need and what this convention im increasingly convinced is about is pee wee reese
7651038 its about jackie robinson in the field being jeered by the crowed and pee wee reese bringing his credibility to jackie robinson putting his arm around jackie robinson and essentially sending a message to the rest of the democratic party this is my teammate
7651039 it is how delegates conduct themselves on the floor that will define whether its a good idea
7651040 if you have no health insurance and you have no job and you are about to be evicted out of your home on jan 20 the very next day after obama is inaugurated youre going to be closer to being evicted you will still have no health insurance you will still be unemployed
7651041 i wonder and i worry to be honest whether or not the expectation that some black folk are putting on mr obama is so high that even jesus christ himself might not be able to be able to respond to the pressure

7651063 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7651064 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law

7651091 a rework was done in the plant using different formulations of painting materials
7651092 after the rework was completed it was determined that the combination of materials used to repaint the frame and chassis could lead to delamination of the paint materials from the body and frame structures
7651093 such delaminating can take place in the area of the body where the windshield and roof have been affixed with adhesive
7651094 which could affect the adhesion of those components to the vehicle body increasing the risk of separation this could cause a crash if the roof or windshield separated from the vehicle while in motion

7651156 we are proud to work with szicc and to contribute to the continued growth of the semiconductor ecosystem here
7651157 i think weve got some areas where weve improved on offense particularly players have improved
7651158 from a defensive standpoint they have an experienced secondary returning
7651159 i was given notice and pulled aside that after looking at his record they noticed that he has another year of competition that he had not used it would be terrific if i get another year with him hes a very good player and he loves football he and i have spoken about it and we are just going to focus on the season that we have here in front of us for right now well worry about next year when next year gets here i have no clue how this happened it was the people that work in the compliance office they found it out and i was just notified
7651160 i think weve had high expectations for ernie since he arrived hes gone a little under the radar for most people but i think weve been very confirmed that he has had good practices and done some nice things we were ready for his level to increase and improve and it has the players that i mentioned some of them may have been household names and some of them may have come out of no where but ernie has been right there and been steady now we just need him to demonstrate it in the games and i think he is prepared and excited to do that
7651161 we are very confirmed on how we want to play
7651162 offensively and in the kicking game we expect to do well and it is one of those things where you put the time in and we have players returning but that doesnt mean the other team is just going to advocate that to you you have to go out and earn it in the kicking game we have to do things to really change the game because everyone is very confirmed on offense and defense and how they want to do it with the players we try to recruit and the style we want to play the kicking game is a big part of that most coaches will tell you that but we really try to live it
7651163 at defense end we are about four deep at this time which is a positive we like what is going on at nose tackle we feel very positive about that we try to be very multiple and the truth is that some of those players listed at defensive end could play in a variety of places but you have to have a starting point
7651164 we have done a lot this camp it has been one of the best camps that i have been apart of we have done a lot of snaps done a lot of reps and talked about a lot of things it is my third year here i feel as comfortable as ever about the system and i know my guys and what they are capable of doing we know what we are doing and im just excited to go do it
7651165 thats motivation in itself to have most of those guys back that have played and are still playing in the nfl i think it is an honor to have them come back i cannot believe it has been 10 years and i know they feel the same way they were such a good intense high quality team with high character
7651166 camp is very important and something that you have to have everyone needs to have that time to sharpen your tools or knock some of the rust off i like game week better because you get to prepare for your opponent you get new information you get to watch game film and study for your opponent and wrap it up on friday and play the game on saturday
7651167 talking to coach frank leonard really sold it to me they work hard for everything they get and i like the presentation the school gave me looking at the depth chart and who they play and how coach prince treats the players really sold it to me
7651168 i feel like i was a leader with jordy even though i knew what his next step was i knew that it was my time to step up right now i have a lot of receivers on the team that are looking up to me and im proud of it and im going to keep doing that
7651169 being in the division i level and the big 12 the guys are a lot faster there is a lot more that goes with playing football at this level being here since the winter has helped out a lot learning stuff early
7651170 while the 5 increase in bar beverage prices is not surprising based on trends in other restaurant segments its the differences among various types of drinks that are interesting
7651171 soft drinks are up on average 13 and top shelf margaritas are up 79 on average
7651172 we found that a house margarita increased by 38 while a belvedere and tonic is up 28 on average which is a bit counterintuitive
7651173 house brands command lower prices whereas premium brands cost more these increases suggest that restaurants believe they can pass on higher increases for the lower priced item
7651174 on the whole its price increases that influence the findings not only are price increases more frequent than reductions but their magnitude is also bigger
7651175 comparing prices this year vs last year for specific drinks at specific concepts 52 increased while only 3 decreased with the remaining 45 unchanged moreover when prices went up they did so by 65 on average yet when they went down they did so by 58 on average
7651176 operators typically seek to drive traffic by offering customers value through core menu items so we expect lower increases on food than on beverages which are rarely priced on the menu drink prices typically arent communicated as part of a deliberate strategy to encourage consumers to purchase without worrying about the cost whereas with food items consumers often make conscious menu choices based on price
7651177 we are witnessing the development and acceptance of a new moral code in america
7651178 mosaics have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
7651179 the consistent deterioration of the bible as the source of moral truth has led to a nation where people have become independent judges of right and wrong basing their choices on feelings and circumstances it is not likely that america will return to a more traditional moral code until the nation experiences significant pain from its moral choices
7651180 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market
7651181 technicals have a consolidative look and there is no fresh fundamental news of any consequence to move the markets
7651182 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7651183 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence

7651188 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7651189 shipping companies are really a proxy for global economic sentiment more than two thirds of the goods in the world are transported through ships
7651190 this area in transportation has not really been accessible before in an etf or in packaged form
7651191 weve been working with delta global for about two years delta global has actually been selecting a shipping uit unit investment trust portfolio for us and weve had success there in raising assets we wanted to bring an etf version of it to market
7651192 shipping companies are really the backbone or the infrastructure of the worlds economy
7651193 as more and more trade barriers come down as many of the frontier countries and bric countries continue to march toward developed market status there will be more need for ships and more goods being transported across the world shipping is a fairly efficient way of doing that
7651194 i cant believe ive been here in this nursing home for more than a week now
7651195 h ow the days have flown even though ive been in bed most of the time i still feel weak and cant shake off that bad cough

7651199 oh and heres a little tip for those of you who dont know we dont just want tips for our pocket we want em for the food that uncle sam taxes us to feed you
7651200 i think that a lot of people might really be ashamed of themselves if they could witness their own behavior
7651201 just so you know the bottled water service is not meant to rip the money out of your wallets but a precaution we must take because believe it or not there are people out there who refuse to drink tap water
7651202 ill let you in on a little secret we have meetings on up selling and suggestive selling and yes we have to go and listen to someone explain the importance of upselling for 2 hours at the butt crack of dawn on a saturday
7651203 at our restaurant and most other high end major restaurants we have what we call a shopper
7651204 i dont understand the gripes about asking if you need change

7651206 we would not need to use the sweepers or brooms on the floors if you and your kids did not act like pigs throwing everything on the floor just because you dont have to clean it up
7651207 one woman dolma yungzom was shot five or six times point blank after she unfurled a banner

7651216 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7651217 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7651218 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7651219 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations

7651251 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7651252 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7651253 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7651254 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7651255 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7651256 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7651257 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7651258 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7651259 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7651260 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7651269 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy

7651298 during the first six months of 2008 power supply shortages continued throughout china and southeast asia and widespread blackouts and brownouts occurred even more frequently than in the previous periods
7651299 this reflects the need now more than ever for local power generation to create an efficient and cost effective power supply throughout china and southeast asia

7651305 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america but the harsh harsh truth is you cant change america when you quote and these are johns words the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support with president bush what he said
7651306 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policy
7651307 you cant change america and end the war in iraq and say these are

7651309 a task for mr biden the advisers said will be to doggedly portray the presumptive republican nominee senator john mccain of arizona as a handmaiden for president bush who would continue his policies in the words of one adviser mr biden can be an artful critic because he knows chapter and verse about mr mccains senate votes and controversial positions after serving with him for two decades

7651316 continued activities of insurgent groups create a climate of fear and insecurity not conducive to rapid economic development and new investment in assam and other north eastern states it is therefore essential for all citizens of assam to use their collective wisdom to persuade the ulfa to give up the path of insurgency and confrontation
7651317 i have said on a number of occasions that power in a democracy flows from the ballot rather than from the bullet and that all grievances of the people of assam can be addressed effectively in our democratic polity i therefore call upon the ulfa to join the national mainstream and work with all of us for rapid social and economic development of assam

7651360 i dont think the clintons can control their supporters anymore there is no telling what might happen
7651361 we hope and expect that bill clinton will give a stirring and perfectly acceptable speech by broadcast standards
7651362 however if we see his face turning red and his forehead starting to throb well be there to pull the plug
7651363 the clintons love this country and they love the democratic party
7651364 they are going to be active parts of our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7651365 could not be more clear about their support for my candidacy
7651366 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7651367 but if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes

7651405 i have opinions of my own strong opinions but i dont always agree with them
7651406 its seems as if the media is obsessed with promoting the republican agenda of dividing the democratic party by constantly harping on the hillary clinton supporters more than obamas historic candidacy
7651407 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7651408 john mccain was not able to listen to madonna while he was a pow for five years

7651410 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7651411 i think its funny how folks blame the candidate for the people who support them obama did not invite madonna to do this she did it on her own free will he is not to blame for that he doesnt have to agree with it nor does he have to waste him time commenting on it no candidate is perfect and i do not agree with everything any candidate says i will vote for the candidate who after i cut through the rhetoric has my best interest in mind and who i believe can lead this country in the right direction i swear some people do more research when looking for car insurance than a presidential candidate are you smarter than a 5th grader if so prove it

7651418 how can i leverage the explosion in social networking trends as part of my online marketing strategy
7651419 update got a call from comcast hq and they sent a team out and fixed the problem they say they monitor twitter and saw my complaint
7651420 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7651421 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7651422 have you heard it from her mouth have you have you did her campaign say it on the record
7651423 im sure i can get her voters im not so sure she can get mine
7651424 are you better off than you were 8 years ago
7651425 others expressed hope that mccain might tap her as his running mate on a new
7651426 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7651427 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7651428 many republican voters seem to believe incorrectly that the current republican front runner arizona senator john mccain supports abortion rights
7651429 despite all the talk that we hear from the democratic party here in colorado about unity the democratic party is in fact divided
7651430 i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7651431 the poll also showed that nearly a third of clinton supporters now say they will back mccain
7651432 the survey suggests that the public is not convinced that senator john mccain r arizona would follow bushs policies if elected
7651433 small minds talk about people mediocre minds talk about events great minds talk about ideas
7651434 during her tenure the market halved hps value and the company incurred heavy job losses
7651435 ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7651436 why is chelsea so ugly its because janet reno was her dad
7651437 im sure i can get her voters im not so sure she can get mine
7651438 thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor august 25th 2008 3 57 pm et
7651439 take your ball and go play for the other team
7651440 hillary clinton can congratulate herself for single handedly handing this election to mcsame which means 4 more years of distress for america
7651441 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7651442 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7651443 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7651444 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7651445 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7651446 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7651447 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7651448 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7651449 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7651450 evan tracey of tns media intelligence cmag cnns consultant on television ad spending reports since only january 1 2007 nine thousand ads have aired using clinton in a negative way on behalf of republican candidates or issue groups at a cost of 7 2 million
7651451 h i l l a r y s a c t i o n s t e l l t h e s t o r y
7651452 we love you hillary but but but we have to go with mccain now
7651453 small minds talk about people mediocre minds talk about events great minds talk about ideas
7651454 why is chelsea so ugly her dad was janet reno
7651455 believes there would be a lot of power in a clinton bush mccain economic contrast and might mention that a bit anyway
7651456 if history is any guide its unlikely the obama staff will know exactly what clinton will say before he says it
7651457 sources close to the campaign if someone wont put their name on the allegation then it cannot be verified
7651458 nyaahm nyaah my candidate beat yours i told you so
7651459 the age joke with mccain is somewhat meaningless because its already trite
7651460 biden is really nice his style is so effusive and unguarded
7651461 chelsea is so ugly because her dad is janet reno
7651462 as a comedian a person a citizen and a mammal
7651463 leave my wife and child out of your ads and conversation from here on
7651464 he said the never ending television news cycle creates a false sense of urgency and forces reporters to follow the veins that have been mined instead of pursuing serious and in depth reporting
7651465 nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people
7651466 its stunning where this election is going to be decided on
7651467 john mccains wife was hospitalized with a minor hand sprain after shaking hands with supporters the senators campaign says
7651468 mccain compares to bush about as much as obama does all you fools that repeat the mcsame mantra over and over are showing what moronic hypocrits you are
7651469 hi my name is jon stewart i make second rate impersonations and make half hearted attempts at da da humor im only really known for taking out tucker carlson which was actually cool but it was also several years ago media does suck but hey its not like im doing anything different i too work for a corporation and would sell my soul if i was taken off it
7651470 the latest polls could spell trouble for fill in the blank in the election
7651471 actually i guess thats a good fit for an inexperienced candidate because obama is a joke in himself
7651472 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7651473 i am not up on the economy dont know much about industry really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7651474 paygrade obama was acknowledging that only god can answer when life begins and he was right dont twist the answer to suit your needs only god knows when life begins and to answer that is above mccain and obamas pay grade
7651475 for years as a pow i didnt have any kitchen tabels
7651476 hilary i need you to win please be my vp
7651477 when i was a pow we didnt have an economy or the internets to learn things
7651478 poor families did slightly better than richer families at least in proportional terms producing a modest net decrease in income inequality under republican presidents rich families did vastly better than poorer families producing a considerable net increase in income inequality
7651479 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now in the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now which means if youre a corporation deciding where to do business youre starting to think beijing looks like a pretty good option
7651480 well there were years when i didnt have any gasoline around
7651481 well there were years when i didnt have any money
7651482 another thing hes supporters are so dumb he promised them they would receive a text message who he would be selecting a vice president first come to find out that was a lie cnn posted the vp before his supporters even knew who it was
7651483 perhaps obama can look at what mccain actually stands for and attack that vs the same same same story
7651484 the reason chelsea is so ugly is because her dad was janet reno
7651485 chelsea is so ugly because her dad is janet reno
7651486 latinos for obama it has to be fake but i am latino and i am sure not obama i am also a registered democrat and a member of puma puma is not republican people its 18 million voters that voted for hillary
7651487 wake up this is just another way of blowing smoke to the public to make them think that joe is just like the average tax payers
7651488 barack obama im barack obama and i approved this message
7651489 announcer with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the sixties trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7651490 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old
7651491 john mccain wants to spend 10 billion a month in iraq tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas selling out american workers
7651492 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7651493 everything was absolutely ideal on the day i bombed the pentagon
7651494 as a turbine blade goes around it creates lift like an airplanes wings and there is a small zone of dropping pressure maybe a meter or so in diameter on the tips of the blades
7651495 bats fly through this area and their lungs expand and the fine capillaries around the edges of the lungs burst
7651496 we compare it to divers they are pretty much dying of the bends
7651497 bats can actually detect pressure changes but were talking large scale relatively slow changes like the coming of a storm front
7651498 they are the first to have done a large scale look at this damage to the bat lungs
7651499 but ultimately it might not matter so much how the bats die but what is attracting them to the turbines in the first place
7651500 weve partnered with industry and federal agencies to raise and spend about two million dollars looking for a solution
7651501 bats are not being killed at all the wind projects all over the country it is happening in some places and not others
7651502 were trying to determine before construction what areas might be risky
7651503 a large portion of the kills occur at the lowest wind speeds
7651504 and at those low speeds the turbines are not generating appreciable electricity anyway
7651505 it wont eliminate the problem but its a good step in the right direction
7651506 this is as close to being a rock star as ill ever get
7651507 when you actually go there and walk those halls this event is nothing compared to seeing that
7651508 the constitution forbids government officials to meddle in religious matters
7651509 decisions about religion are up to parents not school board members
7651510 if parents want their children to have a bible they are perfectly free to go out and buy one
7651511 in the cafeteria students who choose to take bibles and those who choose not to will be visible to much if not all of the student community a prospect made more likely given the schools small size 427 students
7651512 any child visibly ignoring the availability of the bibles or returning to class empty handed will stand out to his peers and thus feel pressured to take a bible
7651513 to encourage the children to accept christ as their personal savior
7651514 headed down a path that is both illegal and costly
7651515 the livestock auction is where all of a kids hard work and dedication is rewarded
7651516 its the generosity of our buyers many of whom are not in the
7651517 thats why adult children should identify where their loved ones need assistance home instead senior care has made this process easier by providing a list of simple look and see signs that adult children can use to identify the types of services their loved ones might need providing seniors assistance with a few basic tasks such as meal preparation light housework companionship and medication reminders often means the difference between whether they stay at home or go to a facility and that kind of independence is very important to seniors overall happiness
7651518 the vast majority of people 50 and older do not require long term assistance at any given time however most people will require assistance at some point in their lives and most families will face these issues with their older family members
7651519 most people in general want to live at homeor independently in a retirement community
7651520 who wants to lose their independence the best approach to staying self sufficient is to plan ahead and accept help when necessary
7651521 first research shows that routine socialization is one of the key aspects of successful aging so its important for seniors to find social activities
7651522 second poor nutrition that leads to weight loss can be caused by multiple factors some of which may be social up to one third of patients i see experience some weight loss at one time or another
7651523 third safety becomes a real concern for seniors who are suffering illness or mobility problems to prevent falls consider putting grab bars in bathrooms placing bright yellow tape strips on stairs or painting the toilet seat yellow
7651524 finally transportation is a big challenge for those seniors who are forced to give up their keys communities can offer the best programs in the world but if you cant get the individual there what good are they
7651525 dementia which includes alzheimers disease and other cognitive problems may impair seniors judgment as well as their memory
7651526 thats when with an older adults input a caregiver can intervene to promote a safe environment and help ensure quality of life
7651527 by helping adult children identify the types of resources that a senior might need to remain independent at home we hope that families can avoid some of the stress that goes with caring for an aging loved one
7651528 the qwest network will facilitate an unprecedented digital experience for the delegates and the media at this years convention such technology was unheard of in 1908 which only highlights the need to stay connected with the people and the events that matter most in our lives
7651529 as you would expect times have changed in the communications world since the last convention in denver
7651530 the level of data and voice connectivity provided by qwest will enable the world to watch listen and read about the dnc as it happens and thats exciting
7651531 the question of how different minority groups will vote has been a major point of interest in this election and the disability community hasnt been included in the conversation
7651532 disaboom conducted this survey to gauge the political inclinations of the largest minority group in the u s the 54 million americans who live with some form of disability

7651543 with our modular approach of delivering exchangeable backplane types and different chassis parts for different cooling options the migration path from prototyping to a mission computer is done very fast

7651565 any group that is opposed to a proven safe technology that enhances food safety is misguided
7651566 its a way to try to come in and clean up problems that are created in the middle of the food production chain i think its clearly a disincentive to clean up the problems at the source
7651567 hopefully therell be some manufacturers that will take that step
7651568 hopefully the public will be less concerned about it all the evidence suggests that theres not a risk
7651569 as far as the bush administration goes i think were seeing a whole raft of attempts to push through regulatory changes like this

7651580 we think its really going to build on our best practices and lessons learned from our operations in iraq but recognizing that it needs to be tailored to the local afghan population
7651581 the big thing that he came out of there with is they were doing a warehouse operation
7651582 the problem seems to be more the detention than the treatment
7651583 the city has calmed down ive been here for four months and ive only heard two rounds fired in the city the whole time
7651584 this will be based on conditions on the ground consequently neither london nor washington have endorsed plans and normal contingency military planning at the tactical level is under way
7651585 i can train an iraqi soldier as much as you like but unless the government sits down and says i am going to rule that city i am going to find a way to impose my will to impose the rule of law on that city come what may nothing is going to work
7651586 that was never for us to do and we couldnt make them want to do that
7651587 president bush came into office and declared he had a vision but in practice there was nothing visionary innovative or well thought out
7651588 and as a consequence we have been driving full speed ahead on neutral for a very long time
7651589 with the bush administration we have no sense of any legacy at all
7651590 its fashionable to say bush missed opportunities and was using the wrong paradigm but i disagree the dna of peacemaking is strong palestinian and israeli leadership and that we dont have
7651591 if bush had tried to do more in these circumstances he would have risked further deteriorating the prestige of his presidency
7651592 there is not enough time to do any work now none of the players are in any shape to formulate policy and no one has energy to work on this peace process
7651593 the only thing we can hope for now is to avoid a complete breakdown in dialogue and keep a small flame going for the next american administration
7651594 there is absolutely no hope for progress on the peace process at this junction
7651595 the idea that this is going to strengthen abu mazen in any substantial way is a big mistake
7651596 there will be celebrations yes but the day after nothing significant will remain and it will not move dialogue forward
7651597 im doing this because im tired of hearing that rugby is a white sport

7651599 there need to be sports academies for blacks and at the lower level there must be a culture of rugby developed
7651600 but because there is so much money in rugby the money will take the talented black players

7651606 everything you always wanted to know about the bible but were afraid to ask
7651607 the bids came in substantially below what medicare pays on average 26 percent below these new prices took effect on july 1 benefiting taxpayers and patients
7651608 the new medicare competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment has created concern and chaos for beneficiaries physicians hospital discharge officials and home medical equipment providers across the country since it was implemented in 10 metropolitan areas on july 1
7651609 the medicare trust fund will become insolvent by 2019 and the most promising way to fix medicare is with the same engine that drives the u s economy competition
7651610 but the trade association for medical equipment suppliers and other lobbyists has worked hard to derail this bidding program the lobbyists argue that the bidding process was flawed and competition will create some job dislocations some companies wont survive thats probably true competition creates winners and losers but medicare is not going to get a handle on its rising costs by re jiggering its government controlled pricing as long as the anti competitive provisions are in the bill it will be bad for patients and taxpayers
7651611 in the miami area for example a standard power wheelchair that cost medicare 4 024 last week will cost an estimated 2 817 under the new system the cost for someone paying the 20 percent co pay would drop from 805 to 563
7651612 the bid process has severely curtailed the number of approved businesses the number of approved firms for oxygen in greater miami for example fell from more than 400 to 46 medicare insists there are enough businesses to meet demand but says it can add more if needed
7651613 the american association for homecare which represents the businesses that sell the type of equipment the government is slashing prices on calls the changes a train wreck
7651614 rob brant owner of city medical services in north miami beach fla was one of the losers his seven person company gets about 80 percent of its business from medicare patients and didnt make the cut in the new bidding process im in very big trouble he said
7651615 medicare bidding program creates major problems for physicians hospitals and beneficiaries seeking home medical equipment

7651629 if you talk to the physicians who have adopted theyll wish they would have done it sooner
7651630 it is challenging and requires a lot of time and resources
7651631 we are all very excited to enter a new semester this fall
7651632 wellspring academies has among the best documented initial and long term outcomes of any non surgical weight loss intervention for any age group this is one reason why we attract so many students from all over the world each year
7651633 we are headed toward a two tier health system unless something changes we will be rationing care to the elderly the way health care is rationed in canada
7651634 once again we see the dismal failure of government run health care everyone is bickering about reimbursement rates from politicians rather than letting the market set prices for the goods and services
7651635 the texas medical association and other physician lobbying groups would be better served demanding the market set the rates
7651636 when they go along with the premise of government pricing it becomes a battle of the best lobbyists not the rational needs of patients and doctors expressed and priced through the market
7651637 voters were assured dirigo would never require an increase in taxes
7651638 not only has it failed to cover many people but all the false promises surrounding it have distracted maine from doing anything that would actually help improve the situation
7651639 i am proud to say that were moving toward a day when health insurance will be affordable for and available to all mainers
7651640 tobacco taxes fall predominantly on low income households so raising tobacco taxes to fund health insurance is akin to taxing the poor to provide coverage to the poor
7651641 if maine truly wants to cover more people it needs to make coverage more affordable
7651642 a costly ineffective failure that best serves as an example of what not to do
7651643 politicians in maine like politicians in massachusetts are addicted to government spending while taxpayers are stuck with the bill and continue to see no benefit
7651644 dirigo care was enacted with the lofty goal of covering the uninsured
7651645 maine has one of the highest state and local tax burdens we should not be adding more taxes for this boondoggle particularly at a time when maine families are struggling with record high gas and heating oil prices and an uncertain economy
7651646 what is really great about dirigo is that it along with the massachusetts connector program are the only two examples that we currently have of universal health care schemes that have actually been implemented in the united states
7651647 dirigo is the more mature of the two programs and it is already past the train wreck stage
7651648 by eliminating excessive mandates and costly regulations on health insurance such as guaranteed issue and community rating that drive prices up
7651649 until the legislature passes a bill to provide affordable health care to more than 800 000 uninsured state residents
7651650 gov rendell is hitting the states health care providers where it hurts them most in the pocketbook
7651651 rendell knows that taking away the mcare subsidy that enables practitioners to afford the astronomically expensive malpractice insurance required by law will force them to the bargaining table and the price he is asking of them in order to restore mcare is help pressuring legislators to waste more of pennsylvanians money on futile attempts to enact so called universal health care
7651652 the pennsylvania health care cost containment council has added value since its inception in 1986
7651653 it is my hope the council will be renewed for a significant number of years with fewer legislative encumbrances to facilitate the effectiveness of the council for the benefit of all who use their data
7651654 the governors decision to reopen the council by executive order proves that his action to shut it down last week was unnecessary
7651655 this is not because it has helped contain costs it hasnt however it has done a good job of revealing hospital by hospital prices for specific services in fact its mission should probably be redefined since it serves as an agent of transparency far more than a cost containment body
7651656 they deserved to be reestablished i am glad the governor stepped up to the plate
7651657 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7651658 shes on her way to the little country of georgia

7651660 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7651661 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist
7651662 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7651663 this is a significant milestone for org as it has consistently grown 20 percent year over year since its management by public interest registry
7651664 org continues to be the domain of choice for individuals and organizations who seek to brand their efforts under a globally trusted and respected address
7651665 we cant imagine wikipedia as a com org is a core part of our identity
7651666 org is available to anyone in the world and it is a great way for an organization to signal an ambition to be inclusive and global
7651667 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7651668 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7651669 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7651670 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7651671 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7651672 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7651673 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7651674 i believe the ought to be preserved which means no gun control
7651675 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
7651676 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7651677 thank god for mayor mark begich he could be our 60th senator
7651678 i dont think sen obama believes that is an appropriate place to be drilling at the moment
7651679 anwr is my neighbor we strongly believe we can safely develop on land drilling but on off shore drilling we should not even talk about it think of those of us that breathe and live and eat because of that ocean before you even think about off shore drilling
7651680 you need to come up and see it reserve judgement until you do
7651681 the weather took some getting used to but today today i feel good
7651682 spate of school expansions is no tonic for student proficiency
7651683 at sites of biggest school expansions more than half saw test score declines
7651684 but bricks and mortar have not raised student performance testing data shows
7651685 at west the number of students who posted proficient or advanced level scores declined by six percentage points in math seven in reading and language arts and eight in science eisenhower scores in each academic area saw a dip but smaller than at west from one percentage point in language arts to five in science
7651686 got about 18 million votes this year running against obama
7651687 joe biden who gained the support of a few thousand caucusgoers in iowa before dropping out of the race
7651688 if you really think this is love i have a bridge to nowhere in alaska i would like to sell you
7651689 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
7651690 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
7651691 pdx is pleased to be the first aggregator of multi pharmacy electronic prescription records to enter into a strategic relationship with google this new agreement will allow our pharmacy customers both chain and independents the ability to integrate client prescription history into google health at the users request
7651692 we believe users should have access to their prescription history and medical records and should be able to organize this information in one safe and centralized place
7651693 working with pdx will enable several nationwide pharmacies to connect with google health giving millions of patients access to their own personal data
7651694 spot us would give a new sense of editorial power to the public
7651695 im not bill and melinda gates but i can give 10 this is the obama model this is the howard dean model
7651696 crowdsourcing why the power of the crowd is driving the future of business
7651697 its not like the crowd is killing the newspaper lots of things are killing the newspaper the crowd is at once a threat to newsrooms but its also one of several strategies that could help save the newspapers
7651698 our initial determination is that were in overall agreement with the facts outlined in the original petition
7651699 by virtues of the fact that it may be determined that she is the custodian of records for the office of the governor

7651711 time and again governor rendell has publicly denied pennsylvanias health care delivery crisis exists in spite of the fact that patients have died due to the commonwealths loss of trauma care services and mothers and their unborn babies have lost access to delivery room services throughout philadelphia and beyond
7651712 governor rendells allegiance to special interests representing personal injury lawyers in spite of his own constituents loss of critical medical care is abhorrent
7651713 philadelphia holds the distinction of being home to some of americas best medical teaching colleges yet it cannot keep physicians in the state
7651714 in the past decade fourteen philadelphia area maternity units have closed leaving hundreds of mothers and babies in the heavily populated northeast quadrant in grave danger
7651715 in the real world ideas are not hogwash but they are very unlikely to make you rich on their own more important it really does not matter who gives birth to any particular idea this is borne out by the laws relating to patents and inventions you cannot patent an idea you can only patent your own method for implementing an idea it is for this reason that so many people have become rich despite never having had a single great idea in their lives as it happens i could myself among them
7651716 we are pleased to have concluded our ninth consecutive profitable quarter since our ipo in april 2006
7651717 all of our vessels in our current fleet are under three year time charters with established charterers pursuant to which we have secured 100 of our operating days for 2008 and 64 for 2009
7651718 we would like to reiterate that we are pursuing a strategy of prudent growth gradually expanding our revenue and profit generation capabilities
7651719 we remain optimistic about the long term fundamentals of the product tanker market the area of our strategic focus
7651720 finally we continued with our stable dividend policy declaring our ninth consecutive quarterly dividend of 0 50 per common share
7651721 we have now paid or declared on schedule nine consecutive quarterly dividends since going public in the amount of 0
7651722 our subordinated share structure enhances our companys ability to pay dividends to the public shareholders
7651723 as of june 30 2008 the company had a ratio of debt to market value of 54 with respect to the current eight vessel fleet and a net debt to book capitalization ratio of 63 including debt already incurred under the predelivery financing of the seven newbuildings which we believe are modest ratios for industry standards given our strong time charter coverage and the young age and quality of our fleet
7651724 the restructuring of our debt facility toward the end of the first quarter of this year has had the effect of taking advantage of our current low interest rate environment decreasing our interest expenses while at the same time it has increased our financial flexibility and will enhance our ability to pursue our strategy of prudent growth aimed at increasing shareholder value in the longer term
7651725 the lightning was too close we evacuated the senior patio and had students go inside
7651726 several cinder blocks were blown apart and strewn over the patio
7651727 although obama is offering a new series of tax breaks they undermine rather than improve economic incentives

7651732 selfless courage under extreme enemy fire that was essential to saving another soldiers life
7651733 im glad that all of us survived that there are plenty of engagements where people under similar circumstances arent as fortunate
7651734 there is definitely something to the phrase that leaders are made not born
7651735 i didnt think too much about the enemy fire i just knew he was hurt
7651736 at the time i just thought it was the right thing to do
7651737 i remember him crawling over to me and me saying jack im hit
7651738 i knew i was in a lot of pain but if i didnt stand up and try to contribute and carry sgt sapp things would get worse
7651739 he decided he wouldnt quit he was faced with the ultimate choice and chose to be unselfish
7651740 i knew i was ok because i hadnt gone into shock
7651741 i believe that i just had to do what i had to do in that situation
7651742 i think many soldiers would have done the same thing
7651743 previously each branch had its own switchboard system but now we have one platform for all our sites our major cost saving results from eliminating the costs of inter branch phone calls as well as the use of outbound dialing technology which further cuts telecoms costs
7651744 this meant that often our customers would reach a dead end and have to call back
7651745 now we are able to see the availability of the back office staff and if the person is not available we can offer our client some options
7651746 because we are located at different sites we had seven separate systems that required maintenance now we only need to maintain one platform
7651747 while it is too early to quantify we expect a significant saving in maintenance costs these savings are critical as merseta is required to keep our operating costs under 10 of the total funds we administer
7651748 for most people obama is the tax cutter in this campaign
7651749 the obama plan would cut taxes for 95 of workers and their families with a tax cut of 500 for workers or 1 000 for working couples
7651750 tax cuts for low and middle income seniors homeowners the uninsured and families sending a child to college or looking to save and accumulate wealth
7651751 senator obamas proposed tax cuts for the middle class are actually marginal rate hikes in disguise
7651752 a staggering 45 effective marginal rate 11 percentage points higher than under current law
7651753 require that 10 of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
7651754 we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
7651755 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 reduction by 2050
7651756 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood
7651757 we dont want to return to marginal rates of 60 or 70
7651758 you should never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth
7651759 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
7651760 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
7651761 its kind of weird that they are switching week to week with no tournaments
7651762 to be number one its really tough to be that good for 52 weeks
7651763 hopefully it comes down to players that are stepping up and winning the tournament
7651764 but we as players we are used to it i think for the fans they dont really know
7651765 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7651766 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the us government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7651767 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation
7651768 i dont have any announcements for you on that one way or the other
7651769 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide
7651770 they are a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7651771 we are competing with three important cities tokyo chicago and madrid rio de janeiro has concrete chances
7651772 obviously as a brazilian i want to win as many gold medals as possible but there are others who also want to win i think brazil won some things that it was not in the habit of winning
7651773 the frustration that we brazilians have is that we always expect to win the gold medal in football
7651774 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7651775 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7651776 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7651777 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7651778 in diesem konkreten fall ist die internationale gemeinschaft jedoch mit einem paradoxon konfrontiert f r das sie selbst einen entscheidenden teil der verantwortung tr gt br ssel und washington haben die unabh ngigkeit des kosovo anerkannt trotz des nachdr cklichen widerstands ru lands das vor der schaffung eines pr zedenzfalles eindr cklich gewarnt hat
7651779 zumindest seit es den albanischen kosovaren gelungen ist ihre eigenst ndigkeit von wichtigen staaten v lkerrechtlich anerkennen zu lassen
7651780 aber nicht die demokratiebewegung gemeint ist die regierungs bernahme durch saakaschwili in der sogenannten rosenrevolution gk war das hauptproblem f r ru land sondern der klare wunsch georgiens nach einer nato mitgliedschaft der politische konflikt eskalierte auf dem nato gipfeltreffen im april in bukarest deutschland das dem zunehmend selbstherrlich agierenden saakaschwili skeptisch gegen bersteht und eine vermittlung mit ru lands interessen anstrebt stand an der spitze einer gruppe von nato mitgliedern die georgiens aufnahme in ein spezielles vorbereitungsprogramm f r die mitgliedschaft zun chst verhinderte wenig hilfreich war f r die georgische regierung au erdem da sie im vorfeld der parlamentswahlen zu beginn dieses jahres die opposition gewaltsam niederhielt die regierung in den usa mu te den widerstand mit unwillen akzeptieren washington h tte gerne ein klares signal der unterst tzung f r georgien ausgesandt und damit ru land demonstriert da der einflu des westens nun in den kaukasus reicht nun zeigen russische panzer wer das land kontrolliert
7651781 wer den konflikt vom zaun gebrochen hat wird durch die kriegshandlungen nebens chlich ru land f hrt einen angriffskrieg auf fremden staatsgebiet
7651782 da die nato aus reiner menschenliebe milliarden verfeuert mu man nicht glauben wer hegemonie beansprucht mu damit beginnen sie zu demonstrieren mit oder ohne v lkerrecht
7651783 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7651784 the radical islamists do not make rational calculations about their interests
7651785 because their interests are inherently irrational as they like to remind us they love death

7651790 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7651791 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7651792 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7651793 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7651794 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7651795 we had some growing pains then and were going to need some help now
7651796 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7651797 the one that runs out there first it really doesnt matter
7651798 because law enforcement is one of those careers where its stressful to be a cop and deal with what we deal with everyday
7651799 the program has really been utilized across the board by a lot of different people
7651800 it could have given someone in the faimly a voice that they feel they didnt have
7651801 challenged all the employees not only police officers but all the employees to say hey dont be afraid to admit this is stressful and it affects your family
7651802 michigans veterinarians and wildlife experts have been working throughout the weekend to complete their investigation
7651803 we take this disease very seriously and are using every resource available to us to implement response measures and stop the spread of this disease
7651804 currently one of our top concerns is to confirm that the disease is not in free ranging deer
7651805 we are asking hunters this fall to assist us by visiting check stations to allow us to take biological samples from the deer they harvest so we can perform adequate surveillance of the free ranging white tailed deer herd in the area
7651806 we regard this as complete vindication of our effort to change the system and end the monopoly of iowa and new hampshire from going first

7651832 knowledge of modern methods of contraception is very similar across the five areas with most women knowing about female sterilization oral contraceptive pills injectables and condoms the great majority 86 know a place in soroti district for obtaining contraceptives
7651833 despite the high level of knowledge of the most commonly used methods in uganda only five women 4 reported currently using a modern contraceptive method female sterilization 1 injectable 1 and condoms 3 the contraceptive prevalence rate is lower than the national average seen in the 2006 udhs for a rural area 15 or the eastern region 17
7651834 are the women now being taught birth control and are the men allowing them to use it
7651835 are the women now being taught birth control and are the men allowing them to use it
7651836 according to baseline results knowledge about family planning methods among both men and women was high 90 although use is extremely low 4 unfortunately attitudes of women and or men towards family planning method was not captured in the survey report and we hope that this together with any other information regarding the social cultural religious or health systems related determinants on use of contraceptives will be captured in the second year of the project when the promotion of family planning methods starts this information will help further inform the project plans strategies approaches in promoting fp in katine during its second year during the second year of the project we plan to train village health teams vhts on the use of family planning methods and support them to provide information on the use of family planning methods to the community we will also support them to provide family planning supplies including condoms to community members as part of their wider role of providing community based health services this will include referrals to the health facilities for more surgical methods of family planning eg tubal ligation intrauterine coil device iucd vasectomy norplant implant etc gender with emphasis on male involvement is a key strategy for amref not only for family planning but also other health activities specifically at the community level the project hopes to devise strategies for male involvement with full participation of the community in katine men and women to ensure ownership and sustainability other interventions addressing reproductive health include 1 training of tbas in recognition of danger signs effecting early referrals pmtct immunization and prevention of malaria in pregnancy 2 training of health workers in obstetrics care 3 rehabilitation and equipping atirir health centre iv operations theatre mostly to aid delivery and surgical operations for maternal related complications
7651837 land as factor in population and reproductive health doesnt arise as land shortage is not a serious issue here the problem is poverty as exhibited by large tracks of uncultivated land this is due to limited technology and farm inputs to make productive use of land beyond the familys physical labor force however large the family may be even were some families produce more theres limited access to markets for their products hence a disincentive to cultivate large tracks of land so land isnt a factor in reproductive health here but poverty low incomes household food security being able to feed the whole family with nutritious food all year round family health especially mothers health and children spacing them and education being able to take children to school and meet their needs
7651838 especially the isolation of one village amongst hundreds of others
7651839 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7651840 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7651841 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7651842 so let there be no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
7651843 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks im proud to be a miami dolphin
7651844 i like what weve seen and i think the guy will do a great job out there managing the game
7651845 hes moved our team and the team has responded really well to him so thats where were going
7651846 were going to go out and kill the ant with a sledgehammer
7651847 thats what were going to try to do were going to go out and win big theres a lot of eyes on us right and thats why we have that mentality about the ant and the sledgehammer were just going to try to obliterate teams
7651848 we expect these players to play at a higher level and to perform and execute at a higher level
7651849 i think everyone is anxious to get the year started

7651854 the whole week is going to be a do nothing week
7651855 the market doesnt dance with the same partner forever its all a matter of investors starting to look beyond the valley of all the problems to better times ahead
7651856 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7651857 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7651858 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now
7651859 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7651860 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7651861 t he people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
7651862 found to be handling or deciding cases based on politics and not based on what the law and facts require
7651863 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7651864 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7651865 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7651866 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7651867 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7651868 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7651869 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7651870 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7651871 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7651872 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7651873 dont make us get rough thisll be a lot easier on you if you just co operate
7651874 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7651875 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7651876 wait a minute my grandma is dead i must be dreaming
7651877 i have the same dream every couple of months is that weird

7651884 vrijdag 6 juni j l een artikel in dagblad zaanstreek over rob goezinne van de partij voor de ijsbaan hij kwam met een plan voor een mobiele ijsbaan terecht opmerkingen van andr drost pvda en bert boer groenlinks om met een beter gefundeerd plan te komen volgens de raad zijn de cijfers nergens op gebaseerd we kennen rob inmiddels goed genoeg en hebben hem er al meerdere keren op gewezen dat ongefundeerde uitspraken met onvoldoende onderbouwde gegevens de zaanse schaatssport geen goed doen wij weten in het district ook dat ice world een mobiele baan kan neerleggen maar zo eenvoudig als rob het voorstelt is het niet
7651885 how does somebody get the ability to send out mail with taxpayer money only in the years when hes running for reelection
7651886 at best theres something wrong with the law either city law or state law
7651887 his initiatives are larger hes created more programs and done more for the district this year
7651888 every mailing he sent out this year was directly related to an initiative he was doing
7651889 it gives him an unfair advantage we are concerned about it
7651890 weve had only misery but we need to be happy this is the first time that i forget everything can you distinguish a shiite from a sunni no they are all iraqis
7651891 kenyan youth living and working in the streets are finding new ways to raise awareness about the issues that matter to them using online blogs and photography
7651892 indeed let them welcome with confidence the challenges awaiting them imbued with this excellence and a corresponding humility with tenacity and a loving servitude todays youth must move towards the front ranks of the professions trades arts and crafts which are necessary to the further progress of humankind this to ensure that the spirit of the cause will cast its illumination on all these important areas of human endeavor moreover while aiming at mastering the unifying concepts and swiftly advancing technologies of this era of communications they can indeed they must also guarantee the transmittal to the future of those skills which will preserve the marvelous indispensable achievements of the past the transformation which is to occur in the functioning of society will certainly depend to a great extent on the effectiveness of the preparations the youth make for the world they will inherit
7651893 i was sick and nigh to death and i vowed at every breath oh to walk in wisdoms path but my repentance lasted not my vows i soon forgot oh damnation is my lot as i sailed
7651894 for this would be the same as if an absolute prince knowing he had unlimited power to issue orders and compel obedience but being neither a physician nor an architect wanted to direct medical treatment and the construction of buildings resulting in serious danger to the life of the unfortunate sick and in the obvious collapse of structures
7651895 the bible is the word of god given in the words of men in history
7651896 i think that the contact approach supplemented by that of confirmation provides the most fruitful and reasonable response that has held so many scientists away from an appreciation of religion and even a larger number of religious people from enjoying the discoveries of science
7651897 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind

7651908 the dispute over the rightful board of the congregation and whether the respondents election violated the religious corporation law cannot be decided by application of neutral principals of law citations omitted rather resolution of the parties dispute would necessarily involve impermissible inquires into religious doctrine and the congregations membership requirements
7651909 friedmans religious standing within the congregation is essential to resolution of this election dispute petitioners ask that this court not only determine the validity of the respondents election but also to recognize the petitioners including friedman are elected officers and the authorized governing body of the congregation with such membership issues at the center of these election disputes matters of an ecclesiastical nature are clearly at issue these particular issues must be resolved by the members of the congregation and cannot be determined by this court
7651910 as the grand rebbe has not given any indication of the wishes to the contrary the court leaves intact the status quo in terms of the day to day operation of the congregation and its institutions until and unless the grand rebbe or any appropriately invested ecclesiastic tribunal rules otherwise
7651911 the dispute over the rightful board of the congregation cannot be decided by application of neutral principal of law

7651920 its still a problem that might resolve itself but certainly needs to be attended to but theres a lot of things in here you know millions of things and its easy for just one little thing to be wrong
7651921 its a bottle of wine i got it for my husband
7651922 what happened to the guy i met three years ago who believed in and practiced random acts and words of kindness because he assumed the best in people first i really miss that matthew who by his words and actions shamed me into realizing that my pain made me first look for the faults and problems in people not their innate worth and possibilities
7651923 years of bad writing habits from instant messaging and e mails
7651924 miss crawfords reckless actions created a significant risk to the safety of others
7651925 fortunately because of the swift response by the defendants employer and the u s department of agriculture the staple was recovered before the meatloaf was ever circulated for consumption to the general public

7651938 susan b anthony is not on trial the united states is on trial
7651939 without having a lawful right to vote and in violation of section 19 of an act of congress
7651940 had no social acquaintance with him and didnt wish to call on him
7651941 he sat down he said it was pleasant weather he hemmed and hawed and finally said mr storrs wanted to see me what for i asked to arrest you said he is that the way you arrest men no then i demanded that i should be arrested properly
7651942 i could not see a lady i respected put in jail
7651943 the fourteenth amendment gives no right to a woman to vote and the voting by miss anthony was in violation of the law upon this evidence i supposed there is no question for the jury and the jury should be directed to find a verdict of guilty
7651944 has the prisoner anything to say why sentence shall not be pronounced
7651945 yes your honor i have many things to say for in your ordered verdict of guilty you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government may it please the court to remember that since the day of my arrest last november this is the first time that either myself or any person of my disfranchised class has been allowed a word of defense before judge or jury all of my prosecutors from the eighth ward corner grocery politician who entered the complaint to the united states marshal commissioner district attorney district judge your honor on the bench not one is my peer but each and all are my political sovereigns and had your honor submitted my case to the jury as was clearly your duty even then i should have had just cause of protest for not one of those men was peer but native or foreign born white or black rich or poor educated or ignorant awake or asleep sober or drunk each and every man of them was my political superior hence in no sense my peer
7651946 in the two years since the north american free trade agreement went into effect on january 1 1994 the unregulated stampede by u s businesses to open factories just south of the mexican border has turned an environmental danger zone into north americas cesspool
7651947 approximately 35 percent have been infected with hepatitis a and by the time they are 35 years old 85 to 90 percent have it
7651948 the relationship between the two countries has markedly improved over the last two years
7651949 im hesitant to say that because i think it still has a long way to go as many of you have heard me say before a few years of good relations cant really compensate for decades of misunderstandings and distrust
7651950 us government policy has shown clearly that it used to oppose the government now it shows clearly that they are pro government
7651951 they seem to have more cooperation with the government than before thats why they have less criticism of the government
7651952 the united states should not reduce aid to local ngos and they should not undertake more cooperation with the government they should strengthen more democracy and human rights in cambodia they should not give more aid to the government but should strengthen more aid to local ngos so the local ngos can strengthen human rights and democracy in this country
7651953 the oil could be a very good thing for cambodia
7651954 because cambodia is such a poor country and the economy is at such a low level that the oil if its used properly if it is used for the benefit of the cambodian people if its used to build roads and develop the educational system and the health system and things like that it is an opportunity for cambodia to really jump start its country and jump start the economy
7651955 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man

7651984 youre actually producing a bit of the reservoir into the wellbore
7651985 that is totally contrary to light oil reservoirs where you always want to keep the sand out
7651986 were going to put really significant drawdown against these open perfs
7651987 and thats going to induce the formation to produce into the well
7651988 no one has yet determined how you can pull sand along a horizontal well

7651999 hes here as a result of the un becoming aware of the additional help and ensuring that the budget presented to donors took into account the experiences from all the other tribunals
7652000 with his advice and assistance we will be able to put together the revised budget
7652001 we are quite able to proceed for the next year
7652002 on the un side its a little bit more difficult they would expect to run out of funds within the next few months
7652003 having no other choice they come to phnom penh begging for the prime ministers intervention this cant be the way we must have a powerful system that can solve the crisis effectively unlike the national authority for the resolution of land disputes hun sen has publicly warned land grabbing officials who often have high posts in the government or military to stop the practice or the prime minister has warned about this more often than us
7652004 if more and more farmers continue to lose their land continue to face a state of anger and suffering im afraid one day they will lose their patience
7652005 people suffering from land grabs are falling into a situation where they have nothing to loose
7652006 they are losing hope which forces them to resort to whatever means and it could lead to what is called a revolution over the land crisis
7652007 it is normal among all nationalities of the world turning from poor to rich and revolutionaries toppling feudalism to become feudalists themselves
7652008 leaders who abided by karl marks doctrine to topple capitalists become capitalists themselves
7652009 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue

7652014 global intergenarational forum celebrating 60 years of the universal declaration of human rights
7652015 i learned a lot from many well known guest speakers during the whole forum
7652016 the topics covered were human rights peace and reconciliation leadership fund raising and millennium development goals speakers shared their life experiences on leadership and how they have struggled for the promotion of reconciliation and peace and the respect for human rights and democracy
7652017 im not alone in doing my work helping children since the 75 participants of the 50 countries are from different backgrounds i found that social issues like human rights child rights gender equity poverty reduction hiv aids and education will come into a positive solution
7652018 bodies in peak condition performing with everything theyve got are an image of freedom as are pristine landscapes like yosemite and the tetons but the reality of freedom only exists when these phenomena arent deployed to cover up other bodies that are cringing starving bleeding or dying other places that are clearcut strip mined and contaminated but the associations between the two are crucial to our sense of compassion and of what it means to be a part of a global community
7652019 our russian women gymnasts are unrivalled not because of good luck but its due to their talent yevgenia kanaeva rose to olympic championship deservedly nearly 3 5 points separated her from the second place finisher nothing of the sort has ever been registered at olympic games before
7652020 we russians earned the highest score for technique so we are the worlds best
7652021 no one dreamed of winning olympic gold in this sport before the jamaicans failed to get the baton round cleanly but it became clear to us only at the finish we showed the best time and we won
7652022 the russian fans were the rowdiest of them all normally the loudest cheering comes from the fans from iran and turkey you hear them even if there are only a few but this time our russian fans were the greatest at this olympiad
7652023 people who love sen clinton will continue to love sen clinton i love sen clinton
7652024 but our democratic nominee is going to be sen barack obama thats who our party voted for were going to make him the next president of the united states we are fully united around him
7652025 if biden gives that little extra boost to obama in places like the scranton wilkes barre area in a tight race like the 11th its a nice add on for kanjorski
7652026 find the flawed chip and you could get nvidia fail
7652027 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7652028 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the sixties trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7652029 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7652030 ability of a person to identify or recreate a musical note without the benefit of a known reference

7652046 basically theyre just not an arts friendly government and they dont get it in terms of the value these programs offer
7652047 i think the biggest damage will be done to the trade routes programs that bring international delegates and buyers into canadian music events
7652048 people like brent grulke hes the artistic director of north americas biggest market place south by southwest
7652049 for artists who are looking to tour internationally or to open up new markets for themselves the trade routes grant is definitely geared towards that and from my perspective a really effective tool to use
7652050 its a significant way to get the canadian brand the music out there and im disappointed to see that gone
7652051 i can only assume the intent of those cuts is not financial but the government attempting to control which artists are supported and what these artists are saying
7652052 when that starts to happen in a country its time for artists and the general population to stand up and say this is not a good thing and the question is where does it end
7652053 obviously the government of yukon certainly values the contribution of arts and culture not only to the social but the economic well being of the territory
7652054 aimed at accentuating and integrating with these cut federal programs so its disappointing
7652055 weve taken great pride in enhancing our programs and will raise this issue when we travel to quebec at the end of september for a meeting of federal provincial and territorial ministers of culture
7652056 its one of the best most high yield programs in the country and for the conservatives to drop that is unimaginable
7652057 it was a different experience than i expected it was a similar kind of race nothing to unexpected i was in a better state of mind than i thought i would be more calm and relaxed it has been a unique experience that has provided me with a lot of confidence moving forward
7652058 i am happy with the result i set out with a top eight in mind as a real and achievable goal you always want more but whether i deserved more at this point in my carrier is debatable but it is a very solid ride in a first olympics and it has gone a long way to letting me see what work needs to be done to take the next little step
7652059 it is my best result to date and the most mature i have raced ever i think
7652060 this was a totally different story to the points race as a team we raced with a lot of immaturity early on and we paid for it later i knew in the race it was going to happen or was likely to blow up in our faces but it is a team event and you dont want to waste the efforts of your teammate either if it went our way we could have had a medal i suppose but the logical part of me knew it was not likely to happen that way
7652061 no not really i just tried to make sure i raced the right way i did for one and not the other
7652062 well seventh in the olympics is the best finish i have had so i would say it is right up there i tend not to rank my finishes though each one is different and i view them that way
7652063 absolutely i did i cant wait to come home at the end of september when my season is over and thank and share the experiences i have had because of the support from up there
7652064 at this point it is unknown i need to continue to race and be supported it is ironic that after my biggest and best results i find myself unemployed as the team i ride for no longer has the capacity to pay salaries i will continue to ride for some team but that may not materialize until next year right now i will race a few more races leading in to september then i plan to come back to the yukon and do a canoe trip and speak in the schools if we can arrange it now through november is also a big time for sponsorship and i am going to be working hard on finding sponsors to help fund my next few months especially subway whitehorse has come on to help which is great and i look forward to thanking them personally when i am home
7652065 thanks to everyone from up there at sport yukon and in the city and communities that have offered support both finically and otherwise it certainly feel like that support made competing at this level easier

7652099 not because of lexington but lexington was one of the high profile accidents we took into account
7652100 if we start worrying why it cant be done wed issue a lot fewer recommendations
7652101 a high risk of a catastrophic runway collision occurring in the united states
7652102 after the lexington accident we looked back over 10 years of data at incidents when there was some confusion about the right runway to take off on
7652103 we were concerned that people were becoming complacent on some of the safety issues
7652104 lexington is a smaller airport and we challenged all the smaller airports to meet those standards before then
7652105 simply restating the takeoff runway as the notice directs is therefore not responsive
7652106 in the united states were at risk of overreacting to certain events
7652107 the truth is most accidents are caused by factors that are unseen in this case the comair crash it is hard to regulate human judgment

7652120 a big part of what the seminarians will learn is how to balance a secular life with a rich faith
7652121 they will bring something special to the united states and bring back something valuable to hanoi
7652122 its an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7652123 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7652124 i think were in big trouble without her on the ticket
7652125 not really united yet but may be by the end of the week
7652126 i would say that were a very unified party and people are excited about the obama ticket
7652127 but we know there are still folks out there who have very strong feelings about sen clinton and maybe wish that she was on the ticket so were going to continue to do the work to reach out to them and talk to them about where we are and where this campaign is going

7652135 when i told the girls who the choice was i said its this man named senator biden and malia our oldest said well is he nice and we said yes hes a very nice man i met his family and he believes in family and he works hard and then she said is he smart and i said hes very smart she was like well if hes a nice man and hes smart then it sounds like a good decision

7652167 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7652168 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7652169 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7652170 this is a tragic outcome of centuries long standoff of peoples living in the region which the present and former leaders of georgia have failed to overcome

7652292 this boy who thought he was saved was probably persuaded by some dramatic guy giving a message and the kid didnt know any better i will pray for the guy giving the message because he will have to give an account for his message
7652293 wives likewise be submissive to your own husbands that even if some do not obey the word they without a word may be won by the conduct of their wives when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear do not let your adornment be merely outward arranging the hair wearing gold or putting on fine apparel rather let it be the hidden person of the heart with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is very precious in the sight of god
7652294 so god appeared as jesus and died so we can be saved from the rules that god himself setup in the first place
7652295 god will forgive us our sins if we believe in him but he wont forgive us for not believing in him that does take a bit of ego dont you think

7652299 we are talking about spiritual matters you are trying to think intellecually about the apiritual truth of god about his kingdom about him and it wont work never will god is spirit the spirit of truth love righteousness not of the perceived frail failiable human thought process
7652300 it is through grace you are saved by faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god so that no man can boast atheist as were discussing the biblical god then we must discuss him from what he has revealed to us
7652301 i think that any god that is going to punish you for not believing in him by torturing you in an everlasting burning hell is not only vengeful but pretty sadistic to boot
7652302 christianity is the only religion where god did it all for us

7652338 this loss will do nothing inside the locker room besides renew vigor and for the first time in the past couple weeks i cant wait to get back to practice
7652339 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties

7652343 obviously if the employee is stupid enough to take their laptop with them and tell their employer that they are available then they are going to be exploited
7652344 no wires at least one battery per wireless device the proliferation of different batteries the characteristics of which are beyond the understanding of many users is a worry were becoming totally beholden to battery manufacturers worse many most batteries dont share chargers
7652345 wireless is great for laptops and such but i would not use it for file transfers unless there was no other way to do it
7652346 im with you wireless when it is convenient and wired ethernet when its possible given the opportunity to wire from new i would put in cat6 and fibre with hubs in a central closet then make the building into a good faraday cage to stop leakage except where i want it then i would perhaps put high directional aerials to limit the spillover to the back garden
7652347 i suffer those dead zones with wifi especially as our house has brick walls however i recently found a good solution networking over mains cabling just buy an adaptor and plug your ethernet cable from the pc onto the wall power outlet you connect the other pcs the same way and instantly have a wired network
7652348 i built a house last year and had it hard wired although i have an 802 11g router that smokes and is very reliable i just like to have a stone reliable connection without interference from anythng i am seriously thinking about getting a dual frequency n router next you are right about the cost of wiring my builder says that the vast majority of houses being built in this area are cat 6 wired along with the coax for video it adds little to the price
7652349 there is currently far more traffic than wi fi can handle with fios headed even higher even a single user may find wireless limiting especially when operating in fringe areas just look at what can be using the network in a home a couple of media center extenders or similar devices streaming video to two different rooms a voip call or two going on some large background downloads aka the latest windows update or a new linux distro file transfers to a nas box or home server throw in a video on demand some chumbies an aibo blog a lil im and a dozen or so rss feeds you get the idea if you build the bandwidth it will be used and then some gigabit ethernet can only just keep up now imagine whats ahead and how far behind wireless is today
7652350 professionally im a wireless network engineer that said if i were building a new home with walls not yet installed the only question would be cat5e or cat6 and i would probably settle for cat5e i love wireless and find it incredibly useful but i still want my wired network available in particular in a new home nothing beats that gig switch for transferring large music and video files with my son in the next room or backing them up to the server in the basement
7652351 wires will never go away when you need a dedicated link between two devices wire is the cheapest and easiest way to go they will become less and less used in consumer applications used for the final interconnect between some wireless devices and the user interface but in the business world wires will be around for a long while
7652352 my home desktop pc the xbox and the web phone box are plugged into the router the printer scanner my sons ibook and my work pc connect to the network wirelessly if i could build a house id have it fully wired for ethernet because of the speed security and expandability
7652353 am i concerned about radio waves not really as it is theyre all over the place and theres not a conclusive study out there on its potential harmful effects
7652354 im not the least bit worried about electromagnetic energy frying my brain or anything else there is far more energy just from the wiring in your house but no one is talking about that i guess tv hair dryers and microwave ovens are too important to give up
7652355 i do worry about all these electromagnetic signals theres no way to escape them and i think one day well find out they can cause all kinds of illness maybe when its too late
7652356 ive seen the reports concerning health risks and they sound valid
7652357 years ago i worked for a plastics factory who made parts for motorola
7652358 you are still a youngster compared to some of us the first remote control tv that i recall for sale used not wires but a pneumatic bulb and plastic hose squeeze the bulb hard and it changed the channel clicked over one place fortunately at the time there were only 12 channels vhf because obviously you could advance the control in one direction
7652359 ela brooke a melhor madrasta que sam lola e cassandra poderiam esperar vendo seu amor e afei o com aquelas tr s eu sei que ela ser uma m e incr vel
7652360 eu estava t o interessada em fernando pelos filmes que eu vi que faria tudo por ele qualquer coisa que ele me pedisse
7652361 estou muito empolgada por ter voltado gostei tanto do brasil da ltima vez que tive que trazer meus filhos comigo
7652362 eu disse para o fernando meirelles que seria bom se minha personagem fosse loira e ele vetou porque queria que meus cabelos estivessem da cor natural o que ele n o sabia que meus cabelos s o loiros naturais
7652363 quando se constr i uma personagem normalmente a gente pensa em como vai mont la com esse filme a id ia era justamente n o saber como ela reagiria naquela situa o assim como o p blico eu n o tinha id ia onde aquilo ia chegar
7652364 sab amos que o filme teria um tom obscuro mas nem as sete semanas de filmagem fizeram a gente absorver isso nos demos muito bem era um clima de amizade muito grande
7652365 em uma situa o como essa temos o instinto de fazer qualquer coisa inicialmente as pessoas acreditam no governo que saberia resolver o problema mas a hist ria comprova que tudo acaba em guerra
7652366 parece que no caos anunciado algum tipo de her i como o bruce willis vai chegar e resolver a situa o as pessoas pensam se ela capaz de enxergar porque n o toma a frente da situa o mas eu n o sou o batman
7652367 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
7652368 your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country
7652369 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies

7652390 maneira anti democr tica pela qual governa o presidente hugo ch vez na veneuzela sua ret rica e pol tica anti eua e suas tentativas de influenciar os processos internos de outros pa ses
7652391 parte do problema foi um mau gerenciamento do governo bush que enfrentou a ret rica de ch vez e celebrou a tentativa de golpe de estado de 2002 isso deu um impulso ao presidente venezuelano
7652392 a falta de uma pol tica concreta e de aten o deixou um vazio na regi o e ch vez preencheu esse espa o com sua ret rica anti americana e com uma diplomacia respaldada por seus petrod lares

7652395 o senador obama est decidido a n o exlcuir qualquer ferramenta que possa ajudar a aumentar a liberdade do povo cubano

7652401 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it cordingley said of the incidents involving the boks tighthead
7652402 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7652403 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7652404 the first time he went at me i could see him coming at me and the second time i sort of backed away after referee lyndon bray told me to release the ball from the ruck and luckily for me i did because it sort of just glanced me but i wouldnt have liked to cop the full brunt
7652405 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in he said
7652406 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7652407 its fine its not a problem at all he said
7652408 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age
7652409 as recently as a couple of months ago this woman debra bartoshevich wanted the nation to move in one direction now she prefers the opposite direction she preferred a progressive approach on key issues now she prefers a conservative approach she wanted a break away from the policies of george w bush now she wants four more years like the last eight im not even going to pretend to understand why
7652410 as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
7652411 more than seven in ten pro choice mccain supporters have yet to learn that mccains position on abortion is directly at odds with their own
7652412 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
7652413 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
7652414 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
7652415 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
7652416 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists
7652417 in all the inspections we have not detected any problem that affects security or a link with cost cutting policies
7652418 the airline put pressure on mechanics for them to authorise planes to take off even if they were not ready
7652419 flights and planes are absolutely safe and respect all operational security standards
7652420 at spanair no pilot faces pressure to fly a plane that does not meet all the standards of operational security
7652421 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7652422 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life
7652423 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7652424 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7652425 theyre a leading company in their field they produce good products and they have stepped into the breach when necessary so in six months everybody will have forgotten about it
7652426 maple leafs strategy is almost a textbook copy of what johnson amp johnson did
7652427 so if this is done well it can really mean that the brand doesnt have to suffer too much
7652428 what theyre doing is protecting the brand and its the brand that matters in the long term for maple leaf without the brand they dont have anything
7652429 so theyve been very very proactive about it unusually so because most companies that go through crises of this nature tend to hide its quite commendable from a business point of view
7652430 i think theres enough lawyers out there that like this kind of business that there will be lawsuits
7652431 they can recover a very high proportion of their business maybe 95 per cent 98 per cent theres only a few hardcore people who wont go back to eating roast beef but if they dont handle it properly then it can be a significant loss of business
7652432 the reality is that the risks are huge because youre not just looking at an isolated part of the business but youre looking at a risk to every product that has the maple leaf name on it
7652433 its going to take some time for them to recover from it no matter what they do but this kind of thing at least can help keep them in peoples minds as a company thats reasonably trustworthy and when there is a problem they face up to it and deal with it

7652437 we have structured our services to be able to offer patients continuing care in their homes as long as medically possible
7652438 all signs point to outcomes which are better for the patient and for the family if medical care can be effectively delivered in the home as long as is medically practical
7652439 we often remark that its really hard to get a job here
7652440 but we think thats the way it should be fhc is a wonderful organization particularly because of how selective we are in the people we hire our hiring practices result in a staff of people who are committed to excellence and high standards of professional conduct they work hard for our patients and they tend to stay with us for a long time this is great news for our patients and their families because this results in consistently better outcomes its one of the reasons we are rated so highly by medicare
7652441 there is so much specialized and highly technical medical equipment which can now be used in a home environment
7652442 we think its an important priority of a good home heath agency to make sure that our professional staff are always up to date with the latest advances in care
7652443 me han llamado otra vez desde inglaterra lo hicieron para saber c mo me est yendo en el torneo local y c mo va a ser mi situaci n en diciembre ellos pudiesen ofrecer un contrato multianual pero no s bien cu l es el equipo y cu les son los detalles
7652444 no lo conozco en persona y s lo s su nombre pero est pendiente de lo que vengo haciendo y me ha dicho que tiene ganas de llevarme al extranjero
7652445 s lo he hablado con l no lo he hecho con alguien del wigan o de otro club eso me tiene un poco aguantado porque quiero que me lleve un t cnico para as saber que es seguro que tienen la intenci n de contar con mis servicios en ese equipo
7652446 me llamaron de m xico para preguntarme si quer a volver aunque no me dijeron ni el equipo ni m s nada mi ficha sigue siendo del uni n esperar a hasta diciembre porque no creo que quieran prescindir de m ahora
7652447 hemos ganado dos partidos en casa ahora nos toca visitar a un rival que es fuerte en casa
7652448 certainly if these allegations are proven then we are certainly into the territory of looking at not only his future at that club but his future in the game
7652449 if that happens then clubs are able to act more quickly than in situations where the version of events are in dispute
7652450 obviously these are very serious allegations i certainly support the action of the sharks in standing the player down
7652451 its certainly disappointing in terms of the series of allegations that have been made and its now a matter for the courts to sort out
7652452 there is nothing going on ive been out all day enjoy your sunday
7652453 pretty much that there was an incident at his unit involving some guests that were staying there and he wasnt involved
7652454 but obviously the matter is a legal matter it is a bit of a kick in the teeth luckily ive still got my teeth

7652458 the operation only took a few minutes and apart from the threat of their weapons the robbers did not commit violence against the ships occupants
7652459 nor were they interested in the wallets or the jewels
7652460 they arent known personalities but people with a solid financial foundation
7652461 with the election of the national chairman of the mdc tsvangirai as speaker the people have spoken again they want a change nobody can or will dictate to zimbabweans
7652462 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7652463 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7652464 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7652465 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations
7652466 mr shuah mudiwa has been released but the honourable elia jembere is still detained but we dont know where

7652493 i wasnt happy with my game i lost my interest in tennis and was kind of giving up on the court i felt pretty depressed about it

7652513 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
7652514 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
7652515 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7652516 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7652517 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7652518 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7652519 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7652520 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7652521 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7652522 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7652523 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7652524 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7652525 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7652526 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7652527 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7652528 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7652529 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7652530 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7652531 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
7652532 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
7652533 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
7652534 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints

7652536 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
7652537 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7652538 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7652539 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7652540 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7652541 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7652542 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7652543 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7652544 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7652545 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7652546 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7652547 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7652548 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7652549 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7652550 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7652551 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7652552 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7652553 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7652554 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7652555 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7652556 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7652557 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7652558 you might think if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of tvs appeal
7652559 with no money to spend they see tv as the primary form of entertainment
7652560 the research found one group of 12 people sharing a house who all congregate around the tv
7652561 london still has to deliver as well as china with regard to the quality of the olympic village venues and transport the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
7652562 as the beijing mayor guo jinlong passes the flag to boris johnson the greenwich pips will herald the start of the london section of the show followed quickly by a rendition of the national anthem including unusually its second verse performed by 25 children from the national youth theatre

7652592 seans car did not get pulled over no gun was pulled directly at him one of the cars travelling in a seven car entourage was pulled over for not having proper tags the driver was not issued a ticket because the car was a rental vehicle
7652593 at one point we were talking about instead of me getting killed at the end of the movie what if i didnt
7652594 my idea was what if he wilsons character puts the gun down and all that goes away and we come back two weeks later and these two guys are standing there watering their lawns staring at each other waiting on the next incident
7652595 there are producers who are brave enough to do stuff like that because thats the way life is and then there are producers who give you this bulls t answer that the audience needs some kind of satisfaction that something happened to the bad guy
7652596 so when that came up there was some animosity amongst a few of us for a couple of days because i said lets shoot both endings and try them

7652658 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7652660 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7652661 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7652665 at a time when the world is facing a food and energy crisis of unprecedented proportions plant mutation breeding can be a catalyst in developing improved higher yield saline resistant sturdier crop varieties
7652666 these big issues are intimately interlinked and translate in the agronomy field into a competition between food feed and fuel for soil water human and financial resources
7652667 the breeding of new mutant varieties with a higher yield potential more productive biomass for energy use better nutrient composition for human health better adaptation to climate change and variability or a heightened potential to sequester carbon will be the driving force to meet the challenges of the 21st century

7652681 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7652682 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7652683 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7652684 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7652685 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7652687 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7652688 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7652689 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7652690 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7652691 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7652707 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7652708 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7652709 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7652710 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7652711 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners

7652715 if we were able to detect methane on a more hospitable planet in the future it would really be something exciting
7652716 twenty years from now well be able to do this for superearths
7652717 well be able to see methane in the atmosphere of an earth like planet
7652718 the stis spectrograph would get resolutions several orders of magnitude higher than the tool they used
7652719 we know so little observationally about these planetary atmospheres that any sort of measurement is tremendously exciting
7652720 these are about the most ancient and bizarre frogs you can get on the planet oblate spheroid
7652721 they are like a squished version of jabba the hutt

7652728 clm was well aware of how our eris ems software contributed to the growth and success of ensco teris hazardous waste services by reducing processing costs increasing information access and streamlining regulatory compliance we all felt that the same strategy could apply to clm
7652729 the ease of use in data exchange report generation and true cradle to grave tracking capability were the key factors in choosing ems
7652730 we didnt expect to find one of these things much less two
7652731 you never expect this sort of thing but i think this shows how flexible you have to be in astrophysics
7652732 it shows that there are still valuable discoveries hidden in plain sight you just have to keep your eyes open and connect the dots
7652733 when two stars orbit each other very closely they share material and the evolution of one affects the other

7652735 ontela is lucky to get an executive of damians experience and caliber
7652736 after a six month search led by anderson search partners damian was the clear choice for the role we couldnt be happier
7652737 i approached the ontela team after i heard about their early customer successes
7652738 once i saw the product i was hooked its just that easy to get photos off the phone take a picture and they appear like magic on the computer then when i met the engineering team it sealed the deal the technical talent here is absolutely first rate and growing fast helping the team develop is going to be really fun
7652739 its the natural evolution for the marketing of our directional audio arrays if you get right down to it we have been producing directional audio for flat panel displays like those used in digital signage since dakota audios inception over ten years ago
7652740 their vocalizing a need for a high quality directional audio solution that according to them didnt exist in the digital signage market was a big factor in our decision so far the response has been overwhelming and manufacturing is struggling to keep up with demand

7652753 this recent poll shows that most minnesotans dont want higher taxes
7652754 just six months ago the legislature passed a 6 6 billion tax increase with a gas tax increase a sales tax increase a new car tax and an auto license tax increase and at a time when energy costs are squeezing family budgets to the limit as this survey shows people are saying enough is enough
7652755 we want all minnesotans to understand that this proposed 11 billion sales tax increase would create a
7652756 at the same time the legislature is likely to raise our taxes again next january just to balance the states budget and pay for essential services people are saying enough is enough
7652757 its easy because the difference in policy are so stark that you dont have to get into personal stuff
7652758 ive been in politics for 15 years now im not naive and i do think you need to show the sharp disagreements and sharp contrasts in the direction you want to take the nation but how are you going to go personal against a john mccain hes a person with faults just like the rest of us
7652759 i can only speak from my experience in virginia but what i would always try to do is respond with force and to let people know theres a cost to being negative
7652760 but then the last 30 seconds of my ad would always be about a positive
7652761 its very relevant especially when mccain is trying to paint obama as an elitist i mean senator obama was on food stamps while he was growing up mccain not being able to remember how many houses he has is a great reminder to americans that if were trying to find out who understand people trying to make tough decisions every day that obama has lived it he understands it
7652762 combines head and heart in ways that will be very useful to senator obama

7652768 the uptake of xp was slower than people remember today
7652769 xp was really viewed as a glorified upgrade not a new operating system in its own right
7652770 we used to say xp was like swiss cheese full of holes everywhere
7652771 we consider xp sp2 to be a major release because of the nature of the enhancements
7652772 based on these efforts we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising red hat network or the content distributed by rhn and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using red hat network are not at risk
7652773 would begin to ponder what god is calling them to do as they gain a holistic view of matthew 25 14 46
7652774 it began when a few of us youth pastors were talking and realizing that oftentimes we take students to help others around the world but we felt we needed to be more intentional to disciple our students to see that god is calling them to show compassion and justice right in their own neighborhoods

7652779 experience tells us that intelligence may exist about when a shipment is planned or may be en route or where loading unloading or temporary stops may occur
7652780 details may be lacking until late perhaps when those doing the transporting stop for rest or maintenance or when delays occur at a port bridge or border including stops associated with routine inspections

7652785 era un equipo que ven a trabajando desde hace casi tres a os con los mismos jugadores y de repente de cuatro jugadores de la l nea de atr s le quitas dos estamos hablando que le restas el 50 por ciento
7652786 este equipo no est acostumbrado a recibir tantos goles normalmente somos el equipo menos goleado y ahora siete goles en dos partidos lo que debemos hacer es ocuparnos en corregir los desaciertos
7652787 corregir los errores nos va a permitir en base a un orden defensivo a buscar esa regularidad que tuvimos el torneo pasado y que ahora tenemos que buscar
7652788 the truth is that the completion of the 241 toll road is a critically needed route for the states economy the publics mobility and safety and the quality of life that we all enjoy in southern california
7652789 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
7652790 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
7652791 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
7652792 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
7652793 after 12 years its not so much that you get tired of the people youre with its more that you dont have an identity i think system will co exist with scars they will probably leapfrog each other
7652794 but i like what he does in the white stripes ive only heard a couple of songs from the raconteurs but i liked that too as artists we dont want our music to be a brand like coca cola you want to scratch those creative itches things that you couldnt do in certain situations there are things in scars that arent in system i love metal but i was taking a new direction i wanted to express the side of me that likes roxy music the beatles and the grateful dead
7652795 columbia wanted the record but they let us go out and shop it anyway
7652796 and once we shopped it we said man we dont want to be on columbia any more columbia dont want to burn that bridge for when system returns so they let us do what we want

7652802 its really remarkable the number of organizations that are trying to help women re enter the work force
7652803 companies are very reticent to add to head count and there are hiring freezes so many positions are unfilled but the work loads are still there
7652804 we cannot believe their claims that conditions are safe our house is gone and our relatives staying behind give us a totally different picture of the situation
7652805 iraq has turned into something like a no mans land it no longer belongs to its people
7652806 we are delighted with discovery coves generosity and commitment to protecting the spectacular yet highly threatened coral reefs of palau
7652807 with support from the program we are helping to establish a nation wide network of marine protected areas in palau that will ensure that people will be able to marvel at these underwater treasures for generations to come
7652808 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
7652809 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
7652810 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
7652811 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
7652812 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
7652813 the uk needs to do as italy is doing we need to be assertive and say no more mosques no more islam and at the same time encourage the muslim to return to dar ul islam and stay there

7652818 i didnt receive any other job offers so i accepted the position at the bank of canada
7652819 the stocks of these companies are highly dependent on natural gas prices and shareholder acceptance of this deal will be predicated on what the valuations look like depending on how that changes
7652820 none of us are basing this deal on the price of gas in august
7652821 long term were very bullish on the tightness of the gas supply and despite some relatively good response in the last few months on natural gas drilling in the u s unconventional gas has very aggressive decline rates
7652822 the sale of york furthers kingsways strategy of focusing its resources on its core lines of business such as non standard automobile and trucking
7652823 we will use the proceeds of this transaction to retire our remaining short term debt and to support future growth opportunities in our core business lines
7652824 while this implies some stability in demand the headwinds of tighter lending standards and rising unemployment suggest that a recovery in home sales in 2008 remains a challenge
7652825 with the ongoing weakness in the eurozone we may see another push lower to revisit last weeks low
7652826 as of late the differences in the data between the us and the rest of the world seems to be leaning in the dollars favor and with the shifting global rate expectations the dollar may be poised for another broader rally
7652827 the us dollar has had a brisk recovery off its most recent low if the dollar rally is going to continue there has to be confidence that the backing of the currency is sound
7652828 constantly passing out funds to cover every distressed situation could weaken confidence in the dollar which quickly would be manifested in a rebound in energy prices as well as prices for many other commodities
7652829 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market
7652830 technicals have a consolidative look and there is no fresh fundamental news of any consequence to move the markets
7652831 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7652832 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence
7652833 we will use the proceeds of this transaction to retire our remaining short term debt and to support future growth opportunities in our core business lines
7652834 were seeing some intraday trading but a real reluctance to take the market in a trend like direction
7652835 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7652836 given the short term inflexibility inherent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first budgetary deficit in over a decade
7652837 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7652838 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7652839 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on
7652840 the session was lackluster and was looking for direction when news of the upgrade of gustav came in and all of a sudden prices rose
7652841 we had anticipated that q9 would ultimately be acquired by one of canadas incumbent telecommunications services providers looking to round out its service portfolio
7652842 the current transaction achieves much the same value realization for shareholders but puts the company back in the hands of a private equity investor in the absence of a superior alternative we recommend acceptance of the current offer
7652843 this really confirmed and de risked that the antelope structure does confirm gas and has substantial flow capacity and has volume
7652844 all the factors that have motivated the price down are still intact
7652845 judging from the dollars gains crude oil should be down a lot but that is not the case as a developing storm in the carribean sea appears to be supporting oil
7652846 the merger with grey wolf is a perfect strategic fit for both companies
7652847 together we can deliver high value services that will provide significant value to our customers employees and security holders
7652848 they certainly dont want to burn any bridges with grey wolf they certainly know that theres some key guys there that are very important to the grey wolf company that theyd want to keep around
7652849 the two hottest device launches to date could lead to the greatest subscriber quarter in rogers history when it launches third quarter 2008 results
7652850 these two products alone will be a huge catalyst to this stock in the coming quarters
7652851 revenue growth at rogers wireless stands to improve and while initial phone subsidies may pressure margins in the near term cash flow benefits will quickly follow
7652852 is expected to be highly accretive to precisions cash flow per unit
7652853 the real winner in the deal is basic who will get 25 million in addition to the 5 million breakup fee it already received since grey wolf was sold to a third party within a year
7652854 if you choose to do something reckless such as drive a car too fast and you hit somebody can you opt out of paying the damages
7652855 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7652856 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7652857 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices

7652859 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
7652860 any ideas that we have about her hair are always theoretical and we always have to be prepared but she is not performing and so we dont have to worry about that
7652861 ive never heard anything as awful or as sexist or as racist as to call her that for supporting hillary
7652862 she walked away and i said all you doubting thomases got to get on board
7652863 i said no thats not so and i thought you know it was all over with you know she caught the last word of what i said you know people make mistakes
7652864 i cannot apologize for one misinterpreting what i said thats all i can say
7652865 he knows what he said to me he knows he called me an uncle tom hes trying to backtrack now theres playful jousting and theres stepping over the line
7652866 i think its a misuse of words theres no uncle toms anybody supporting hillary obama its just a mischoice of words
7652867 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7652868 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7652869 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats cobb said the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7652870 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7652871 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7652872 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7652873 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7652874 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7652875 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
7652876 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7652877 further alterations are required to prevent such battles from exceeding a certain predetermined length of time

7652887 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok
7652888 i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7652889 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but i saw the tape
7652890 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7652891 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations
7652892 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7652893 im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7652894 i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7652895 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in later and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago
7652896 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have had some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in that situation now than i did several weeks ago
7652897 yesterday morning i woke up and i said ok not too bad by yesterday afternoon i was like ohh usually two days after is when i feel the worst ive noticed that the last few years today will be a little tougher when you go out to practice than maybe in previous years it was good to not that i like getting hit but it was good to kind of get that over and done with
7652898 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7652899 the generic track which means the democrat versus the republican in any given shows an advantage of on average 15 points
7652900 now theres a big leap between generic track and a named candidate and what we may believe in so our job over the next five weeks is to define our opposition and ourselves and contrast ourselves from what the republicans have provided over the course of the last 16 years
7652901 as you know the democrats carry the agenda of ted strickland
7652902 the republicans supported massive tax increases during their years of power in the governors office if we talk about those things and we put it at a human level well be productive and we will pick up on average five to six pickups a one seat majority which is very thin but many people dont realize or dont know the lines were drawn by republicans and for democrats to win with republican drawn lines really speaks to the tenacity of joyce beatty and the team shes put together the state party will invest resources that i believe will more than double what the republican party will invest in their house caucus because theres a sense of urgency now
7652903 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7652904 the opportunity to have a piece of that to have one of the satellite events could be something very special
7652905 i mean after all this is the birthplace of the olympic games in north america
7652906 you need a 30 000 seat facility so it would make sense that the edward jones dome would be the facility that we would propose

7652914 anyone whos had a child knows that that first few days after birth can be very difficult imagine how hard it would be if you have to keep moving to avoid the police just to do what you think is best to protect your child
7652915 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7652916 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7652917 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7652918 como dice mi mami a r o revuelto ganancia de pescadores
7652919 the previous trial plant that was located up near fishermans landing gladstone it was really a disaster it was a dirty thing and wed never want to see anything like that again
7652920 we want them to know in advance what the body corporate fees will be i dont think thats an unreasonable thing
7652921 this will give consumers a greater level of confidence that they wont be ripped off
7652922 we dont support it and we will be opposing the legislation in its current form
7652923 i think theyve got it wrong and theres been widespread community concern about this
7652924 he said the scenario of the experiments first phase starts with multinational partners and goes down to individual municipalities it begins with a threat that originates in europe and travels toward the united states
7652925 kersh said that as the scenario progresses other agencies and other layers of government become involved
7652926 the problem eventually arrives at the commonwealth of virginia with that threat making it into port and then blowing up this will cause us to work the consequence management part of the problem
7652927 the fusion center is in a state police headquarters and its collocated with virginias emergency operations center
7652928 coordinated with dhs possibly to coincide with one of that departments major exercises
7652929 jessica was used right from the first to sell the war to the american people and to encourage their daughters to join up and be heroes
7652930 soldier ordered not to tell of tillmans death house hearing questions friendly fire tragedy and rescue of jessica lynch
7652931 you saw what happened right after desert storm it wiped out the divisions caused by vietnam at least for a while the country came together
7652932 the us department of homeland security dhs which was created after the attacks on september 11 2001 as a kind of overriding department wants to have the key to sign the dns root zone solidly in the hands of the us government
7652933 our afflicted veterans are sick and suffering and many have died others are now destitute having spent tens of thousands of dollars depleting their life savings in an unsuccessful search for an explanation for their ailments the veterans of the gulf war have asked us for nothing more than the assistance they have earned our refusal to come to their immediate assistance can only lead others to question the integrity of the nation they serve
7652934 out of the 580 400 soldiers who served in gw1 the first gulf war of them 11 000 are now dead by the year 2000 there were 325 000 on permanent medical disability this astounding number of disabled vets means that a decade later 56 of those soldiers who served have some form of permanent medical problems
7652935 when even one american who has done nothing wrong is forced by fear to shut his mind and close his mouth then all americans are in peril
7652936 while networks linked to aq al qaeda core pose the greatest threat to the uk the intelligence during this quarter has highlighted the potential threat from other areas particularly aqi al qaeda in iraq
7652937 recent reporting has described aqis kurdish network in iran planning what we believe may be a large scale attack against a western target
7652938 a member of this network is reportedly involved in an operation which he believes requires aq core authorisation he claims the operation will be on a par with hiroshima and naga saki and will shake the roman throne we assess that this operation is most likely to be a large scale mass casualty attack against the west
7652939 although we are aware that aqi networks are active in the uk
7652940 it could be just a reference to a huge explosion
7652941 they al qaeda have got to do something soon that is radical otherwise they start losing credibility

7652960 the dtv business divestiture is a key step in amds transformation however this action is separate from our planned asset smart strategy
7652961 the pending sale transaction is structured so that the dtv business will receive the necessary ip rights to operate the business as it was by amd

7652965 there is blood everywhere in the unit we have told the police it was you how do you feel about that
7652966 the club does not want to prejudge greg until we have had an opportunity to meet with him and his legal counsel face to face
7652967 however we are mindful that the allegations made by police prosecution at this point in time are extremely serious
7652968 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people are involved in the matter and not being entirely honest
7652969 this places considerable doubt on the version of mr bird
7652970 everything ive experienced each instant has brought me to where i am now
7652971 i pulled over and started crying the memories were so vivid i saw the whole thing again in my mind and i wanted so badly to hurt the people who killed my family
7652972 then i remembered the words of my father respect all who are living and at that very moment i knew revenge was the wrong way
7652973 i felt like i had welcomed the dawn of a new day
7652974 we know by now that the world will never know the absence of war but we can be at peace even in the turmoil
7652975 i have learned to enter the eye of the storm and from there i get a different perspective

7652977 rocks to boulder size objects even up to small minivan size objects all in orbit around saturn
7652978 twice in this 30 year period the rings are on edge and they disappear
7652979 as the planet moves around the sun it presents the south pole of the rings to the sun and then presents the north pole to the sun and half way in between when the rings are edge on we just dont see them anymore
7652980 saturn takes a little bit less than 30 years to go once around the sun on its orbit so instead of it being an equinox every six months like there is on the earth march to september on saturn there is an equinox approximately every 14 to 15 years
7652981 early on there were a lot of stakeholders who assumed that wed bust either bust schedule or bust cost
7652982 if people are thinking that theres no way you can succeed you almost cant lose

7652993 having a similar looking property in different cities around the world isnt going to work anymore they hoteliers have to keep things fresh
7652994 only the trenton democrats would come up with a scheme for affordable housing that makes it more expensive for a family to rebuild a home after a fire
7652995 apparently the new regulations permit restoration work on the ferraros home to be classified as a demolition triggering a required affordable housing fee
7652996 these new rules have confused and burdened communities throughout the state with absurd requirements and tens of billions of dollars in unfunded mandates
7652997 the house wasnt vacant and the house wasnt demolished the house burned to the ground this was an act of god i hope that the intent of the affordable housing law wasnt to punish those who suffered a tragedy sadly these regulations were drafted in such a manner to do exactly that
7652998 you not only got it wrong but you got it really really wrong
7652999 any appeal from this order will be deemed frivolous lacking in probable cause and not in good faith
7653000 the district court must provide the plaintiff with a full and fair opportunity to be heard regarding his failure to comply with the courts orders

7653028 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7653029 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7653030 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7653031 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7653032 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

7653034 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7653035 these findings show that the conscious sense of our physical self and the physiological regulation of our physical self are linked
7653036 in fact our results suggest that the conscious sense of our physical self may actually contribute to its homeostatic regulation
7653037 it does seem like there are these connections broadly speaking between awareness and physiological changes
7653038 any time you can use illusion to tease apart whats happening in non illusory situations it could tell you about whats happening it may be that theyre starting us down the path of looking at these other issues if this can help that would be great

7653067 a lot of people think the major textbook publishers are against e books
7653068 in our mind this is great because the functionality offered in digital devices is probably more useful in the long run to students than printed books
7653069 we have a strong relationship with amazon were aggregators we offer our materials in any way that our customers would prefer to use them
7653070 the consumer book market is very different from the textbook market
7653071 with textbooks students only buy what they are assigned its a narrow set of titles and you have to have exactly what theyre looking for the bar is higher for any entry in textbook market you need a lot of content

7653075 by next summer there should be four solid readers in the market
7653076 this is a serious issue rightly rated critical by red hat and while there may not be cases of widespread exploitation of it it does require prompt and direct response i think red hat is doing that and in the end i think this issue will be highlighted by the companys response
7653077 that would be very bad indeed although red hat says that no updates appear to have been compromised
7653078 the debian openssl issue was another significant security matter both illustrate some of the security concerns internal breaches or code corruption that may be more specific to open source
7653079 most enterprise users of linux and open source software are coming to trust it and increase their use in general i dont think this will impact that trend
7653080 red hat customers have cause to be aware and to be concerned but with any enterprise grade operating system there are going to be security issues this is why i believe it is the vendors response that is most critical customers are being kept aware and updated with patches so i would say the issue is being handled adequately
7653081 while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation

7653130 the governor claims he will strengthen hb 824 with an amendatory veto and executive order but it is apparent he is trying to bypass the legislative process rather than work towards real reform some of his proposed changes have merit and should be debated as separate bills in the meantime the general assembly should reject his veto and put the most important reform in state statutes
7653131 after more than three years of work on legislation to curb pay to play contracting in state government i dont need to tell you why it is needed or why it has been so difficult to get this limitation in state statutes
7653132 gov blagojevich today told reporters that he will issue an amendatory veto of house bill 824 and our attention now turns to persuading the house and senate to reject his changes and enact the bill as written when it passed both chambers this spring without any dissenting votes
7653133 when the bill passed in may all of the main sponsors of hb 824 predicted the governor would issue an amendatory veto as a way to kill the bill
7653134 he also said he will issue an executive order prohibiting large state contractors regardless of which officeholder awarded the contract from giving campaign contributions to constitutional officers legislators and candidates for those offices
7653135 when the legislative sponsors from both parties in the house and senate announced an agreement on the pay to play legislation in may they vowed to stand strong together and fight any amendatory veto
7653136 we remain committed to that strategy it leaves us in the awkward position some might say trick bag of asking legislators to reject some good reforms but thats the upside down world we operate in these days
7653137 after all its the governor who came up with the slogan rewrite to do right in an attempt to convince us that wrongdoing is right and thats just wrong

7653279 this supplemental agreement greatly extends our advantage in securing high quality polysilicon feedstock at predetermined prices to support our long term sales growth combined with our other long term agreements and increased manufacturing efficiencies we remain confident in our abilities to expand our margins in the long term as the cost of solar energy approaches grid parity levels
7653280 further the supplemental agreements inclusion of significant wafer quantities starting in 2010 reflects a significant revision to our capacity expansion strategy whereby future expansion will involve increased cell and module capacity additions relative to those for ingot and wafer we believe that this flexible strategy will offer increased output of solar modules to achieve better market penetration under our increasingly recognized brand this will also allow us to place our technology improvement emphasis on cell and module value areas to further strengthen our brand for 2009 we intend to leverage on this dynamic strategy to efficiently extend our capacity growth to approximately 700mw for cell and module areas while expanding ingot and wafer production capacities to approximately 500mw
7653281 trina solar is an important strategic customer and we are encouraged by their progress made so far

7653479 these bats roost in groups and then they fly out from their roost very close together so a lot of people have wondered how they manage to fly out in groups without being confused
7653480 it may be that under those situations only a handful of bats are actually vocalizing and most of them are listening to each others calls

7653629 edward fell into a reverie not only about sex with florence but marriage and family and the daughter they might have surely it was a mark of his maturity to contemplate such things perhaps it was just a respectable variation of an old dream of being loved by more than one girl she would have her mothers beauty and seriousness and lovely straight back and was sure to play an instrument the violin probably though he did not entirely rule out the electric guitar

7653647 energiegewinne ber pv anlagen k nnen im energieausweis nicht ber cksichtigt werden da er bei wohngeb uden nur den heizenergiekennwert ausgibt die angaben muss ich also entfernen selbst bei einer thermischen solaranlage w re die eingabe der gewinne mit minus vorzeichen inkorrekt da diese gewinne ja direkt auf eine verringerung der verbr uche der konventionellen heizung wirken also schon inkludiert sind
7653648 dass sie die werte meiner geliebten solaranlage aus dem heizenergiekennwert streichen wollen muessen entt uscht mich masslos sachliche argumente dazu die energiebilanz des hauses ist entscheidend wie sie ja auch beschreiben denn der ertrag einer thermischen solaranlage ist ja ebenfalls direkt ueber den geringeren energieverbrauch in der energiebilanz enthalten genauso jedoch indirekt tr gt eine photovoltaikanlage zu der energiebilanz bei
7653649 das ist nun wirklich kein b ser wille von mir sondern eine formale festlegung der enev f r die pv anlage ist hier die situation ganz eindeutig beschrieben der elektroenergieverbrauch auch eine minderung dessen ist nicht bestandteil des energieausweises f r wohngeb ude ich kann diese festlegung auch nachvollziehen da der elektroenergiebedarf eines hauses bzw versch haushalte nun wirklich nichts mit den geb udeeigenschaften sondern vielmehr mit ausstattungsgrad der wohneinheiten und dem nutzererhalten zu tun hat bei einer solarthermischen anlage w re das prinzipiell anders da sie den gr tenteils geb udespezifischen w rmebedarf mindert diese minderung dr ckt sich aber auch schon in den realen abrechnungsdaten aus und kann deshalb nicht noch einmal gesondert eingehen denn dann w rde sie sich doppelt niederschlagen

7653664 bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics this is the only person the only democrat who has been re elected since f d r and he is somebody who is equally adept at talking about domestic issues and foreign policy issues
7653665 now wednesday night most of the focus is going to be on foreign policy but bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums and helping middle class families it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
7653666 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

7653671 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7653672 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7653673 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7653674 we have directed the banks not to create objections in issuing loans as long as the area of residence of the student and the bank branch are in the same district

7653725 a large number of the bat carcasses we found had no visible injuries it didn t look like anything had happened to them
7653726 they were lying on the ground no broken wings or injuries you would expect to see if they were struck by these large blades
7653727 we started looking inside and what we found was a large proportion of these bats internally had severe hemorrhaging so they were full of blood

7653762 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7653763 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7653764 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7653776 we believe this move will help us improve our secondary and ultimately win games we have some young talent on our roster and we are looking forward to seeing them on the field
7653777 i think keith olbermann has gone too far i think chris matthews has gone too far
7653778 i dont see that we have time to be fooling with this
7653779 the level of the coverup here was kind of astonishing
7653780 what if it had been mitt romney would the press have gone after that story more aggressively
7653781 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7653782 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7653783 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7653784 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7653785 what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date
7653786 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7653787 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7653788 during our national convention we will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
7653789 looking out from this podium tonight i see a diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the unity of our party and the success of our 50 state strategy we are the most vibrant and inclusive and energized party and we are ready to compete in all 50 states it is the democratic party that can effect the change that america needs
7653790 there is a notable sense of denial of how harsh the prospects have been and continue to be for radio
7653791 the classic ceo reply is radio is not bleeding as badly as newspapers
7653792 people were running somebody dropped his pants not my friend
7653793 protest the destruction of the environment the use of coal cheap lumber we have to end the war

7653797 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7653798 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7653799 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7653800 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7653801 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7653802 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker
7653803 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
7653804 i find this genetic sequence all the way down the evolutionary
7653805 you think i dont know this what gives you the right to speak as if you have authority over me you have none i like his use of the words wanton woman they are biblical maybe there is some hope for k man after all you there is no hope for you at all you freak of nature go back to the hole you came out of
7653806 i have no need for sex id rather tease you honeybuns
7653807 chips on you dud you got bugged for being near me viruses transmit that way you know
7653808 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum
7653809 q how many bush administration officials does it take to change a light bulb a none there is no need to change anything we made the right decision to stick with that light bulb people who say that it is burned out are giving aid and encouragement to the forces of darkness
7653810 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights
7653811 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
7653812 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts
7653813 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things
7653814 its been over four months since the country is being led by a resigning government which lacks legitimacy to address the problems
7653815 we launched a series of protests in april because the price of rice and other food products were too high but prices have doubled since then
7653816 and president rene preval and politicians in parliament are not doing anything to address the problems
7653817 there has never been an african american candidate for president and many folks around this country have never voted for an african american candidate for any office
7653818 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
7653819 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
7653820 they have an allegiance to mexico where they were taught the u s fought an unjust war with mexico and took this territory
7653821 they believe the territory of these states belongs to mexico
7653822 i think they ll do it without a civil war
7653823 they ll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want
7653824 he s feeding an environment of intolerance that doesn t distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants
7653825 our country has been invaded occupied and settled by 10 million illegal aliens
7653826 my remarks at the center were designed to bring urgency to the conversation
7653827 i believe passionately in protecting our homeland and securing our borders if my language was hyperbolic the danger it described certainly is not
7653828 i think building a double wall long the southern border is the least expensive long term solution to maintaining the heritage of our fathers
7653829 we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws
7653830 require the people already here to learn english pay taxes and get in line for citizenship at their own expense
7653831 it s not practical to deport millions of people but we can t reward or encourage further illegal entry into the united states with special rights or privileges
7653832 corporate greed creates the demand for cheap labor which draws immigrants from across our borders and hurts law abiding american workers snip
7653833 our broken borders unsecured ports and lack of effective inspection and enforcement jeopardize the prosperity and security of americans every single day until we fix it we are vulnerable to another attack like we had in 2001 or worse and american workers and their families will continue to suffer
7653834 in fact it s almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
7653835 the surf action is accomplished the cultural sidebars worthwhile and the mexican radio station a welcome relief from surf muzak
7653836 features same laid back humor surfer slang and hypnotic boarding footage as endless summer it worked then it works now
7653837 all our opponents know if we get it on the ballot it passes
7653838 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7653839 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we don t have to worry about
7653840 black youths within this country have been left to die and that s a very strong statement but it s a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7653841 now we re asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7653842 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets
7653843 in july we launched the 100m youth crime action plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending
7653844 as a result of the shooting the home office was jumping up and down last august
7653845 the question was asked at the time of the home secretary why it was we didn t see the same frenetic activity from the government and the media when the black youths were murdered and yet when the white youngster was killed everybody stood to attention
7653846 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7653847 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesn t matter
7653848 it matters profoundly and it matters in every single instance whether the individual is black or white
7653849 i m glad she got help to save her house i m not mad at that i m upset that the same people wouldn t help me and they denied it was going on
7653850 i had prisoners laughing at me when i approached them about it they knew what was going on it was hilarious to them
7653851 the queens have to look radiant and that is why they have to go and buy quality for the big day they were being spoiled
7653852 those given the money do not even contribute a cent to the money they are looting
7653853 we are against the idea of public funds being used in a questionable way by people who are not employed and do not bring any revenue to the country s coffers
7653854 all i know is that a woman has to seek permission from her husband to register her disagreement with whatever was happening in society but not for her to march that is un swazi
7653855 our culture and the reed dance is my pride and joy
7653856 if you take pride for yourself you can always do it for your country it helps us to know who we are and the people we should look up to the king and princes he is a great king to us
7653857 here we have a problem the king has all powers vested in him
7653858 we want the king to reign but not to rule
7653859 i want to stress to you that political parties remain banned up until the people of swaziland say so
7653860 the only way we believe that the voices of the voiceless will be heard
7653861 just like apartheid was lawful in south africa but it was an unjust system our system continues to undermine and deny the rights to self determination of the swazi people
7653862 that s his weakness he likes women and he likes money irrespective of the obtaining economic conditions
7653863 what is your opinion about the correctness of einsteins general theory of relativity
7653864 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7653865 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7653866 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7653867 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7653868 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7653869 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7653870 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7653871 you know when your head kind of seems to swim because you suddenly think
7653872 single handedly destroy an entire galaxy of fifty thousand million suns each of them with an undisclosed number of inhabited planets without raising an eyebrow
7653873 mile long space ships space fleets of hundreds of thousands of ships heros brave and bold beyond reason and villains straight out of the nethermost regions of hell all seem somewhat repetitious and one cannot even muster the enthusiasm these incredible feats are undoubtedly worth
7653874 some of my friends had similar feelings about the book that it failed in a way none of his culture novels ever succeeded in doing by having too much and therefore being bogged down in the details of space societies rampant ai and alien hierarchies
7653875 the voehn were the calmly relentless highly intelligent omni competent near indestructible all environments capable undefeated uber soldiers of the last nine millenia or so they were the martial pin ups of the age the speckless species peak of military perfection and yet they were few and far between

7653894 the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace is pleased to endorse the 1st world congress on interventional therapies for type 2 diabetes
7653895 aace recognizes the need for interventions that are proven to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes aace looks forward to participating in this very important scientific meeting which will critically examine the potential role for surgery in treating type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders
7653896 i am excited about the collaboration between endocrinologists and surgeons
7653897 together along with other leading experts in diabetes and public health the congress will examine the emerging role of surgery not only as a therapy for type 2 diabetes but as a means to shed light on the causes of the disease the lessons we are already learning from studying gastrointestinal surgery have tremendous implications for the same future of medical therapies of diabetes
7653898 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future
7653899 teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
7653900 teasing out the agents responsible for the beneficial effects of gastrointestinal surgery on diabetes may lead to new discoveries and provide targets for new medications or even less invasive interventional therapies
7653901 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7653902 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7653903 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7653904 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7653905 spate of school expansions is no tonic for student proficiency
7653906 at sites of biggest school expansions more than half saw test score declines
7653907 but bricks and mortar have not raised student performance testing data shows
7653908 at west the number of students who posted proficient or advanced level scores declined by six percentage points in math seven in reading and language arts and eight in science eisenhower scores in each academic area saw a dip but smaller than at west from one percentage point in language arts to five in science

7653949 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
7653950 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery

7653978 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7653979 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behaviour
7653980 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7653981 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7653982 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7653983 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7653984 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7653985 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7653986 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7653987 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7653991 spinz amp dj lkb have created an excellent homage to simplistic beats with life love amp the low end and prove that sometimes less is truly mo better
7653992 the only next step spinz can take is the jump from european festival favorite to the major cities of america a true hustler when it comes to making albums and touring worldwide independently
7653993 the reason is that there was nothing new to say
7653994 cbo estimated effects on output ranging from increases of 0 5 percent to 0 8 percent over the first five years on average and from a decrease of 0 1 percent to an increase of 1 1 percent over the second five years the budgetary impact of the economic changes was estimated to offset between 1 percent and 22 percent of the revenue loss from the tax cut over the first five years and add as much as 5 percent to that loss ort offset as much as 32 percent of it over the second five years
7653995 according to models that account for both supply side and demand side effects those effects might offset somewhat less than 15 percent of the revenue loss over the first five years

7654017 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7654018 they are the joint efforts of the painstaking work of the mothers scientific researchers and quake relief workers
7654019 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7654020 undermine the very thing youre trying to promote by getting them hooked on the rewards
7654021 how we can ensure that students are engaged that they are invested in their education
7654022 i think its incredibly important to make sure students take ownership of their learning
7654023 i think the incentive should come from within just to want to do well rather than doing it for a dollar
7654024 i think middle schoolers should have rewards for getting good grades and stuff on their tests i would save it for college and maybe give some to charity
7654025 it makes me sad to see weve sunk so low that we have to pay kids to show up
7654026 the key is innovation not just sitting around watching the test scores dwindle
7654027 the kids unquestionably love it whether that is translating into higher performance i cant tell you for a fact
7654028 the numbers of students in these schools that have signed up to take ap classes has more than doubled
7654029 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7654030 democracy is more than just a formal process it is a culture
7654031 publicizing the good news out of mauritania should be an urgent task of the state department

7654040 school is practice practice makes perfect noone is perfect so why practice
7654041 makes it one of the most exposed names to recent credit deterioration
7654042 with at least one major rating agency explicitly saying if earnings do not stabilize by the third quarter another downgrade is likely the risks of a near term rating action have clearly risen in our view
7654043 and the ultimate cost of a de risking strategy especially for its credit default swap business

7654047 im very sorry for what ive done im sorry to my family for the embarrassment
7654048 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7654049 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7654050 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7654051 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7654052 he fletcher is great at making those runs into the penalty box
7654053 he has got fantastic energy and im really delighted hes getting the credit he deserves
7654054 failures are only seen in a small percentage of all the chips
7654055 our competition has built a nice product but the nice things that people write about their product is that its well priced
7654056 its pretty discernible certainly desktop standalone graphics theyve seen improvement there
7654057 small incremental gains by ati more like onesy twosy were not talking about 10 point share shifts
7654058 the amd mobile processor business was not as strong as it probably could have been if amd mobile cpus dont sell neither do the nvidia mobile chipsets

7654073 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7654074 i think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsman and farmers didnt notice it
7654075 we just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows
7654076 most of them actually align in a north south direction
7654077 its a very clever use of google earth and the evidence is quite compelling it does seem that these animals are detecting the earths magnetic field and using it to point in a north south direction
7654078 i was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north facing cows and deer it was really intriguing
7654079 it was very imaginative it demonstrates yet again all the unexpected uses of and value of digital geospatial data
7654080 start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer to see how that affects them
7654081 thats one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense
7654082 welcome to the jungle baby were going to fuck you in your culo
7654083 now relegated to playing state fairs and rocklahoma slaughter much like the pokes has the appeal that only a mullet headed white trash stillwater ite can appreciate
7654084 if severe pandemic influenza is largely a problem of viral bacterial copathogenesis double infection pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone e g influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs prevention diagnosis prophylaxis and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines should also be high priorities for pandemic planning
7654085 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
7654086 i worry that there is a segment of the population that might be harder to reach average citizens who will say come on
7654087 said harrison 59 a sociologist at howard university and a consultant for the joint center for political and economic studies here
7654088 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle
7654089 if obama becomes the president every remaining powerfully felt black grievance and every still deeply etched injustice will be cast out of the realm of polite discourse
7654090 our concern is that well get lost in the shuffle
7654091 people feel that theres something callous something racially indifferent in saying wait a minute weve come a long way
7654092 but whether he wins or loses for a black man to become a standard bearer for one of the two major parties it does say something
7654093 it says that the road we started down in 1965 with the voting rights act has come to an end we dont need to talk about disfranchisement in the same way anymore
7654094 a few of my white friends have asked me with barack achieving all of this will we be in a position where we can put race aside
7654095 said representative elijah cummings democrat of maryland who is a co chairman of obamas campaign in that state
7654096 i hope that progressive minded people will not make a blanket conclusion that if barack has made it everybody can make it
7654097 i have never been so na ve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
7654098 hes running for president of the united states not president of the urban league
7654099 i think most people understand that he cant go out and push this overtly african american agenda

7654145 am facut o ca sa mi calc constiinta si sa nu ma mustre
7654146 daca exista pocainta dumnezeu iarta l a iertat si pe david
7654147 iata pe cand stergeam praful am lovit o cu servetul si astfel am omorat musca n am vrut s o fac

7654150 cand eram tanar m am dus sa invat meseria de cizmar dar motaiam tot timpul pentru ca noaptea mergeam cu o banda si furam in regiunea noastra era un ceaus
7654151 duceti va si furati eu vreau doi berbeci mai departe voi furati orice vreti
7654152 cutare si cutare dar acestia sunt in temnita de ce ii clevetiti
7654153 acum cum o sa intram in turma ne vor azvarli ca pe betele de chibrite

7654155 ingrijiti va sa aflati ceva de lucru pentru acest copil eu am incercat si cu alte prilejuri sa l ajut l am trimis si in kastoria la niste cunoscuti sa invete meseria de blanar dar a plecat este tanar si este pacat sa si piarda vremea asa are numai mama tatal lui a murit
7654156 da ne am ingrijit impreuna cu parintele paisie ca acest copil sa mearga acolo si sa invete de la blanar si dupa aceea dupa ce a plecat de acolo cati bani nu a dat pe telegramele ce le trimitea la patronii lui ca sa nu se nelinisteasca dar nu i nimic astea nu se discuta i am spus atunci si parintelui ca nu se va indrepta copilul
7654157 tu sora vei putea ajunge la masurile sfintei tale patroane
7654158 eu nu sunt vrednic de rai sunt pentru iad dar cred ca dragostea si mila lui dumnezeu nu ma vor lasa
7654159 maica domnului e suparata pe aceia care nu i cer nimic

7654162 is multidisciplinary and technologically complex it arises from the intersections of different fields or spheres of activity
7654163 in the future it wont be governments who run cities but rather corporations

7654165 the saakashvili economic policy response to the russian 2006 blockage of georgian wine and mineral water was indeed very courageous and successful
7654166 his big blunder over south ossetia risks indeed now prejudicing that major achievement
7654167 going to come through with a commitment to economic reform
7654168 weve been dazzled impressed and blown away by these beijing games
7654169 london definitely could take lessons from how the beijing games were run
7654170 the best parties arent always the ones that cost the most money
7654171 the challenge for london is to create a party atmosphere with a great sporting experience
7654172 had it been us i dont think we would have necessarily done the switcheroo with the girl
7654173 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that me
7654174 small businesses and individuals across iowa are dealing with the effects of the recent floods and these loans are essential to their recovery
7654175 the arbitrary criteria set for disaster assistance loans with many only being offered high interest loans needs to be immediately addressed
7654176 small businesses are a key component to iowas recovery from the devastating floods that hit the state and for many businesses these low interest loans are the difference between survival and closing
7654177 we only ask for the same treatment as victims of previous disasters
7654178 oral health is directly linked to health status but unfortunately too many marylanders lack access to quality dental care
7654179 this arc grant will help improve access to oral health care for the residents of and will lead to an improvement in the overall health of residents
7654180 this arc grant is a federal investment in educational opportunities and workforce training for the people of
7654181 while i am pleased that noaa has published the final eis signaling that federal action has resumed on this critical issue the overall pace of progress to pass a final ship strike reduction rule has been inexplicably slow
7654182 with less than 350 whales left alive today the n orth atlantic right whale is one of the worlds most endangered species of marine mammals and maines lobstermen have been asked to take extraordinary steps at great social and economic cost to protect them since more right whales die from ship strikes than from fishing gear entanglements the implementation of a final ship strike rule would be a major step toward reducing the number of deaths of these creatures of course the rule must be balanced with concerns for new englands other maritime industries and economy i will review the six alternatives of the eis carefully and continue to work with noaa to effectively protect the endangered right whales and maines shipping industry
7654183 here in oklahoma where much of the population lives in rural areas high quality hospitals such as duncan regional hospital provide an invaluable service
7654184 today i appreciated the opportunity to meet with ceo scott street and the executive team at duncan regional
7654185 through my time in congress i have consistently worked to ensure both urban and rural oklahomans have access to quality healthcare for example i recently worked to include provisions in medicare legislation for ambulance payments in rural areas as well as additional payments for rural home health services and support for rural hospitals such as duncan regional
7654186 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject
7654187 todays announcement is good news for the future of our aerial refueling fleet our air force and our armed forces as a whole

7654189 this summer the canyon lake team their coaches and parents made us proud representing our state and region at the little league world series
7654190 as the first south dakotans to make it to the tournament they are an example of hard work and sportsmanship and it is an honor to present them with a flag today
7654191 i am always glad to get an opportunity to cheer for the home team and the canyon lake team has given us all a team to root for on the national stage
7654192 it was an honor for me to meet this team i can only imagine the achievements these players will reach in their future efforts on and off the field
7654193 i respect his candidacy and i will always have admiration for what he has been able to achieve
7654194 senator joe biden may be one of the only u s politicians that can get iraqs feuding sunni shiite and kurdish politicians to agree but not in a good way
7654195 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics
7654196 this is the first ill vote for a republican president or work for one
7654197 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
7654198 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
7654199 its not like nonprofits have a lot of unencumbered funds lying around to use until they get their reimbursements
7654200 i dont have problems with the reporting procedures in place i dont think it makes sense to have taxpayer money spent without accountability
7654201 theres really no reason that the state cant follow a similar model
7654202 certainly i dont know many nonprofits that have a huge cash reserve and can make themselves float
7654203 we encourage ngos to work closely with state agencies to provide the necessary information so that reimbursements occur in a timely manner likewise the agencies are encouraged to be responsive
7654204 ive heard nothing about what is actually going to happen
7654205 we dont have the money to do those services today so we havent fundraised for this program specifically

7654210 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7654211 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7654212 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household
7654213 the new system is part of the districts continuing efforts to make the flint community schools safer for our students staff parents and the overall community
7654214 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7654215 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7654216 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7654217 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7654218 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7654219 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7654220 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7654221 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7654222 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7654223 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7654224 how much did the clerk get fore rubber stamping this application
7654225 my main thrust as mayor was to always improve branson
7654226 if i hadnt done that i would have gone crazy
7654227 what weve done should make us proud to be part of bransons future
7654228 even for a highly decorated and often recognized scientist like bob this represents a remarkable and extraordinary achievement
7654229 i am particularly excited and pleased to see dr lefkowitz work recognized in this way as his discoveries represent the very best in translational science and medicine and have served to ultimately improve the health and lives of millions of people around the globe
7654230 deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical biological mathematical or engineering sciences
7654231 the national medal of science is a great personal and professional honor that reflects my entire career in the life sciences
7654232 one of the most rewarding aspects of my career at duke has been the opportunity to mentor more than 200 very talented students and fellows many of them have gone on to distinguished careers in academia and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries this award honors them as much as it does me i really cant imagine a more fulfilling career for me than to have been a professor of medicine and a scientist i am as excited about the opportunities and challenges of our work at present as i have ever been and i am so honored that the president will acknowledge our cumulative body of work in medicine and the biological sciences
7654233 im thrilled that bob is being honored in this way as it really is a recognition and celebration of not only his well documented seminal discoveries but more importantly the incredible body of scientific work that has characterized his long and illustrious career
7654234 he is an inspiration to the next generation of basic scientists not only at duke but around the world

7654248 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7654249 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7654250 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7654251 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7654252 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could

7654275 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7654276 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7654277 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7654278 la cosa peggiore e che ho visto tutta la nostra vita assieme
7654279 se tutto il resto perisse e lui rimanesse io continuerei a esistere

7654306 ho imparato che non ha importanza quanto e come si ama tutti noi uomini e donne viviamo le nostre vite da soli non ha senso volersi appropriare di qualcuno e nonostante lo sappia a volte me ne dimentico ancora purtroppo non posso fare a meno di pensarci e mi sento cos sola e triste
7654307 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del proprio destino adesso per riconosco che non tutte le persone sono abbastanza forti da plasmare la propria vita e provo pi indulgenza nei loro confronti di quanta non ne avessi allepoca
7654308 il fatto che perdere ci che ho mi spaventi la prova di quanto sia fortunata ad averlo
7654309 lamore non bello se non litigarello dice la gente eppure secondo me i litigi non sono altro che lo scontro di ego e non credo affatto che quando si confessa allaltra persona il proprio disagio durante un litigio questo favorisca la comprensione reciproca forse vero che non possibile vivere senza subire qualche ferita ma finora ho sempre creduto che fosse doveroso compiere uno sforzo per non infiggerne agli altri sono stata proprio uningenua

7654332 people arent going to be happy when they see that he didnt lower them enough
7654333 only 12 of likely obama voters say mrs obama is very liberal versus 69 of those who plan to vote for mccain interestingly while 63 of conservatives view her as very liberal only 20 of liberals and 28 of self designated moderates feel that way
7654334 forty six percent 46 of likely obama voters say mrs obama will be at least somewhat involved in making important policy decisions and only 12 think she will be very involved but 41 of potential mccain voters expect her to be very involved in major policy decisions and an additional 30 say they expect her to be somewhat involved similarly 24 of male voters and 27 of female voters expect her to be very involved in major policy decisions

7654336 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7654337 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7654338 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7654339 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7654340 the operation only took a few minutes and apart from the threat of their weapons the robbers did not commit violence against the ships occupants
7654341 nor were they interested in the wallets or the jewels
7654342 they arent known personalities but people with a solid financial foundation
7654343 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried

7654349 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7654350 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7654351 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7654352 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7654353 let there be no mistake about it we are united

7654366 if your vice president had to be an athlete who would you pick
7654367 well ill tell you what im a chicago guy so im thinking walter payton sweetness that guy had durability he could block as well as run michael doesnt lose and since i havent won the presidency yet that wouldnt be a bad teammate to have id just keep on feeding him and figure hed hit the last shot
7654368 because of human rights issues there was a loud cry for president bush to boycott the opening ceremonies of the beijing summer games if you had been president faced with that what would you have done
7654369 well i said very early on that i dont want olympics to be overly politicized but when a host country is violating human rights i think we have to say something it would have been an appropriate statement for the president to say that i will not go to the opening games unless we have seen some progress on the issue of tibet if all of us are silent all the time then human beings all across the globe are being silenced and being oppressed in ways that i dont think captures the olympic spirit
7654370 congress played a vital role through its hearings and baseball union and players union into more frequent testing for performance enhancing drugs and stricter penalties when you were watching the hearings what did you think of them

7654594 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7654595 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7654596 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7654597 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7654598 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7654599 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7654600 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7654601 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7654602 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7654603 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7654604 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7654605 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7654606 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7654607 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7654608 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7654609 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7654610 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7654611 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7654612 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7654613 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7654614 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7654615 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7654616 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7654617 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7654618 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7654619 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7654620 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7654621 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7654622 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7654623 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7654624 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7654625 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7654626 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7654627 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7654628 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7654629 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7654630 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7654631 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7654632 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7654633 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7654634 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7654635 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7654636 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7654637 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7654638 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7654639 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7654640 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7654641 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7654642 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7654643 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7654644 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7654645 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7654646 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7654647 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7654648 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7654649 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7654650 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7654651 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7654652 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7654653 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7654654 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7654655 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7654656 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7654657 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7654658 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7654659 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7654660 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7654661 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7654662 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7654663 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7654664 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7654665 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7654666 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7654667 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7654668 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7654669 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7654670 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7654671 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7654672 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7654673 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7654674 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7654675 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7654676 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7654677 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7654678 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7654679 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7654680 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7654681 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7654682 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7654683 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7654684 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7654685 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7654686 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7654687 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7654688 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7654689 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7654690 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7654691 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7654692 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7654693 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7654694 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7654695 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7654696 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7654697 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7654698 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7654699 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7654700 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7654701 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7654702 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7654703 if you ever want to get anywhere in politics my boy youre going to have to get a toehold in the public eye
7654704 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7654705 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7654706 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7654707 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7654708 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7654709 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7654710 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7654711 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7654712 the number of such criminal prosecutions is rising in part because the state has aggressive legal standards and in part because prosecutors say advances in accident investigation technology allow them to more precisely understand the causes of fatal accidents
7654713 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7654714 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7654715 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7654716 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7654717 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7654718 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7654719 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7654720 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do

7654723 the current challenges facing airlines are immense but the board is confident that air new zealand is in a good position to create and seize opportunities in both the domestic and international businesses

7654728 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7654729 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7654730 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7654731 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7654732 es un esfuerzo que nunca se hab a visto y todos esperamos que se traduzca en la mejora de calidad de vida de todos los ciudadanos y por
7654733 vamos a estar muy atentos de que estos compromisos se vayan cumpliendo y poder tener una adecuada rendici n de cuentas
7654734 spate of school expansions is no tonic for student proficiency
7654735 at sites of biggest school expansions more than half saw test score declines
7654736 but bricks and mortar have not raised student performance testing data shows
7654737 at west the number of students who posted proficient or advanced level scores declined by six percentage points in math seven in reading and language arts and eight in science eisenhower scores in each academic area saw a dip but smaller than at west from one percentage point in language arts to five in science
7654738 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7654739 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7654740 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7654741 no solamente el desempleo ha disminuido sino tambi n el subempleo debido a que estamos encontrando nuevas fuentes de trabajo
7654742 con el due o del circo y no con los payasos
7654743 lo que hacemos es analizar la existencia de procedimientos nacionales genuinos contra responsables de cr menes masivos que implican a paramilitares pol ticos involucrados con paramilitares a las farc o conexiones internacionales de las farc si hay procedimientos nacionales yo no debo intervenir
7654744 esto demuestra que desde el coraz n de la casa de nari o hay una conspiraci n contra la corte suprema de justicia
7654745 si existe disposici n de llevar adelante las negociaciones de forma armoniosa eso debe ser calificado de positivo pero si tenemos que ira a otras instancias iremos
7654746 las conversaciones tienen que ver con asumir las operaciones por una comisi n que ya est designada las negociaciones tienen que ver con la valoraci n por la autor a que estamos obligados a hacer aqu hay que valorar los pasivos ambientales la operatividad de la empresa la tecnolog a los costos los problemas laborales esto hay que verlo desde el punto de vista integral
7654747 no descartamos nada en las negociaciones el desarrollo de las conversaciones ir n diciendo qu orientaci n le vamos a dar pero hay que aclarar que hay un decreto de expropiaci n vigente
7654748 se ores ustedes nos arreglan inmediatamente esta central se ores ustedes se responsabilizan por el lucro cesante o sino se van del pa s
7654749 los contratos son horrorosos y descubrimos que los contratos para toachi pilat n que hizo la prefectura de pichincha en este gobierno con esta odebrecht tienen los mismos horrores que el contrato en san francisco as que mandamos a cortar todo
7654750 ustedes me sorprenden con esto no ten a esa informaci n
7654751 este tema est en manos de la justicia nosotros a trav s de nuestro embajador en panam estamos siguiendo paso a paso lo que es la investigaci n creo que es prematuro dar alguna opini n
7654752 la fiscal a de medell n es un desastre una verg enza a m lo que me da tristeza es que fiscales de medell n se hayan dejado corromper y es muy grave que para que la fiscal a tome decisiones tiene que ocurrir un esc ndalo de prensa
7654753 podemos decir que el presidente incurri en varios delitos conspiraci n contra el estado de derecho en tanto hace una deslegitimaci n de la fiscal a un prevaricato porque creemos que si tiene conocimiento de un delito y no lo denuncia est incurriendo en prevaricato por omisi n por ltimo abuso de autoridad
7654754 ponen en tela de juicio el trabajo de todos los fiscales
7654755 por qu no lo retiraron antes yo estaba pidiendo en un consejo de seguridad que hab a que capturar a don mario y all hab a fiscales que informaban lo que yo dec a
7654756 el propio ministro valencia le dice al fiscal general que cree en la inocencia de su hermano como en un actitud sentida que puedo entender y respetar
7654757 low growls and angry snarls assailed our ears on every side
7654758 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7654759 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7654760 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7654761 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7654762 i am inside the camp kalma now there is still shooting
7654763 there is heavy shooting they came into the camp and killed people there are houses burning
7654764 the idps internally displaced people are resisting we are expecting casualties
7654765 they the government of sudan want to demolish kalma camp they want to force people to leave
7654766 a message of defiance to the international community we call on the unamid peacekeepers to do their job and defend the idps
7654767 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7654768 they the search party tried to resist and there was an exchange of fire between the two sides
7654769 we are still waiting for details of casualties from all sides
7654770 theyve been trying to keep it quiet while they work on their problems but the problems may be too great to overcome eric and rebecca used to love spending time together and were barely apart as erics gotten more famous rebeccas behavior has gotten more erratic one second shes jealous of his success the next shes angry and wont speak to him eric never knew what to expect
7654771 gt le blog de h l ne gt gt coups de gueule et coups de coeur
7654772 my whole attitude is that im really focused on the race and during the convention i just want to be campaigning in the district
7654773 the congresswoman is just excited about the convention and all republicans coming here
7654774 i think that will reinforce the image that a lot of people have of her policy perspectives that this has really been about supporting the failed policies of the bush administration in lockstep right down the line
7654775 frankly weve encouraged our candidates to spend as much time campaigning in the districts as possible
7654776 there are more votes in their districts than there are in minnesota
7654777 im running on the republican ticket so i have no reservations about being seen or associated with the convention
7654778 its chicagos to lose if they dont muck it up they should win
7654779 we think its still far too early in this race to identify any city as the front runner with four world class cities in the race all with compelling campaigns
7654780 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7654781 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7654782 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
7654783 if those who serve you serve you well you elect them
7654784 i think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsman and farmers didnt notice it
7654785 we just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows
7654786 most of them actually align in a north south direction
7654787 its a very clever use of google earth and the evidence is quite compelling it does seem that these animals are detecting the earths magnetic field and using it to point in a north south direction
7654788 i was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north facing cows and deer it was really intriguing
7654789 it was very imaginative it demonstrates yet again all the unexpected uses of and value of digital geospatial data
7654790 start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer to see how that affects them
7654791 thats one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense
7654792 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7654793 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7654794 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7654795 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7654796 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7654797 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7654798 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7654799 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7654800 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7654801 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7654802 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7654803 clinton herself has suggested that the party needs a cathartic moment to cleanse any remaining bad blood between the two camps
7654804 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7654805 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7654806 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7654807 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7654808 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7654809 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7654810 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7654811 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7654812 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7654813 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7654814 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7654815 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7654816 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7654817 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7654818 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design

7654841 we have cut our medication errors almost to nothing as a result
7654842 as were finishing prescriptions we have access to the doctors notes the lab results so we can do a better job of assessing whether this drug is appropriate for the patient and whether the dose is right

7654857 the military way underrates t b i and its symptoms
7654858 were at the tip of the iceberg of understanding it it is one of the most complicated injuries to one of the most complicated parts of the body
7654859 we were at the point of getting ready to lose the house and the cars then you start planning out things i was planning to do suicide and make it look like an accident so my family would get the insurance
7654860 she told me nothing was wrong with me but she gave me like 18 different medications for pain to go to sleep for lots of other things
7654861 they said it was because i didnt report it in the field and seek medical attention at the time and there was no proof
7654862 i had guys write statements for me to prove it had happened as a soldier with 23 years in the army them badges mean more than anything when you get injured you should be recognized even if you dont see it over there
7654863 i hear things but it doesnt throw it in the memory box
7654864 i was completely honest and said i dont think i have t b i
7654865 a lot of guys myself included fight the label of t b i no matter how mild in a way its like people are calling you stupid or retarded and i know thats not pc
7654866 since no one understands the relation they have to each other they said if you have one you have the other

7654871 they have reached their final resting place in a ceremony which was final solemn and reverent
7654872 we hope that this ceremony will help us reach out to others in a similar situation
7654873 the goal is to first identify the veterans that are among the unclaimed remains out there
7654874 the point man was out in front leading the others

7654912 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7654913 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

7654915 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7654916 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7654917 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7654918 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7654919 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7654920 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7654921 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7654922 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7654923 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7654924 i think most sitting u s attorneys now staring at the subprime crisis find scant resources available to pursue sophisticated financial crimes

7654943 david has been round at toms house a lot while katie and victoria have been swapping fashion tips on the phone david has been advising tom on diet
7654944 tom has a private gym at his home and david has been working out with him he also gave him diet advice tom has been sticking to 1 200 calories a day mostly grilled chicken and fish with lots of vegetables salads and fruit
7654945 david put together a work out regime that included the treadmill weight training and fencing lessons together
7654946 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles he turned 46 this summer and hes got a 29 year old wife and a young family so he wanted to get back in shape

7654951 it makes a difference what this university does and how we do it
7654952 its a nice ride down but getting back would have some challenges
7654953 enhance policies programs and projects that promote pedestrian and bicycle travel through research education and outreach
7654954 biking is a great solution but it doesnt work for everybody all the time
7654955 what weve seen at other universities is that when you have a strong influence at the top that message trickles down pretty fast i think were going to have a broad level of support both for the student and administrative initiatives we have coming up
7654956 between those two projects well have over 200 indoor bike parking spaces i think thats going to be a big leap forward and be a model for the city
7654957 the kind of influence we need to make sure those projects dont find themselves facing a series of setbacks or delays
7654958 bicycles still have a history here at psu of being value engineered out when it comes to the cost for new buildings and facilities so i think that were starting to see a change in that behavior
7654959 tie into the university as much as possible and i think we have some improvements to make there
7654960 were going to have to work with our city partners to put the pressure on and make sure those improvements are made
7654961 because thats whats really going to help us increase the amount of people coming to campus by bike

7654963 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7654964 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7654965 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7654966 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7654967 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7654968 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7654971 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7654972 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7654973 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7654974 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7654975 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7654976 als ze op een plek gaan kamperen die door god en iedereen verlaten is is het moeilijk hun veiligheid te garanderen als ze op een camping waren gaan staan was hun niets overkomen
7654977 het is hetzelfde als tegen een vrouw zeggen dat ze een verkrachting heeft uitgelokt door een minirok te dragen
7654978 de man is vandaag geopereerd aan zijn kaak en pols de vrouw zal ook aan haar kaak worden geopereerd ze zijn er mentaal nu beter aan toe
7654979 ik zeg alleen dat ze een risico hebben genomen door op die verlaten plek te overnachten

7654984 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7654985 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7654988 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7654989 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7654990 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7654991 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7654992 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7654995 we proberen de jeugdigen tijdens de groepssessies op denkfouten te wijzen zodat ze anders gaan redeneren en zich in de toekomst anders gaan gedragen
7654996 dat praten deze jongeren in hun hoofd recht bijvoorbeeld door te denken ach de eigenaar is rijk genoeg of hij is toch verzekerd die krijgt wel weer een nieuwe
7654997 door bovenaan te starten met het meest hoogstaande houd je de discussie positief degenen die dat antwoord zouden geven mogen uitleggen waarom dat is belangrijk want het debat moet geen asociale lading krijgen je stuurt dus ongemerkt
7654998 ik moest van de rechter werken aan mijn sociale omgang met anderen beter met boos zijn omgaan en moreel leren redeneren
7654999 als angst een rol gaat spelen en ze in problemen zijn worden velen van hen naar het laagste niveau teruggeworpen dan geldt gewoon het recht van de sterkste wij proberen hun morele niveau wat op te krikken
7655000 laat ik dit zeggen er zijn dingen gebeurd die meisjes van zon jonge leeftijd niet horen te gebeuren
7655001 het klinkt misschien gek maar ik heb daar de leukste tijd van mijn leven gehad
7655002 ik was hoog in rang iedereen keek tegen me op ze wisten die zit allang hierzo ik heb echt nooit aan iemand verteld wat ik gedaan heb maar dat ik er zo lang zat zei genoeg
7655003 bijdehand dat is wel het woord denk ik als ik bijvoorbeeld een docent op school niet mocht dan ging ik net zo lang door tot ik uit de klas gestuurd werd ik overschreed daarbij wel eens wat grenzen ja
7655004 ik voel me hier op mijn gemak je kan alles zeggen wat je denkt er is geen goed of fout zeggen ze hier en dat werkte voor mij
7655005 als je vrienden iets doen wat niet mag wat doe je dan de leden van de groep waren het telkens eens je houdt altijd het liefst je mond dus als je hoort dat juan morgen gaat ontsnappen vertel je het zeker de groepsleiding in de instelling niet
7655006 ik zou wel proberen om het tegen te houden maar ik zou nooit uit mezelf naar de leiding toegaan om het te vertellen dat doe je niet
7655007 dat verandert de zaak want ik heb minder met de groep dan met haar dus kom ik sterk voor haar op en doe ik alles om het te voorkomen
7655008 nee ook dan mondje dicht die kinderen kopen het zelf maar ik zou wel praten met mijn broer
7655009 serieus als je in het echt in zon situatie terechtkomt denk je toch wel even aan dat plaatje van die sportauto of de discussie over juan dan heb je toch geleerd wat je hoort te doen en dat schiet door je heen dan denk je h als ik dit doe kan ik in de problemen raken en dan doe je het toch liever niet
7655010 het blijkt ook uit onderzoek discussies over morele waarden maken voor de jongeren expliciet wat hun waarden zijn ik ben egocentrisch denken ze dan bijvoorbeeld je zaait interne twijfel want ze weten natuurlijk ook wel hoe de buitenwereld daarover denkt zo komen ze tot een hogere moraal
7655011 de oprichting van de commissie maakt deel uit van een beweging die je breed in de geneeskunde ziet het evidence based denken
7655012 er gaat overheidsgeld naar al die therapie n dus de commissie beantwoordt aan de maatschappelijke roep om verantwoording van subsidiegeld
7655013 een goed ontwikkeld moreel besef is heel belangrijk in het voorkomen van recidive
7655014 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7655015 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7655016 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7655017 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7655018 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7655019 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7655020 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7655021 who are open to doing something on the production side
7655022 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7655023 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7655024 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7655025 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7655026 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7655027 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7655028 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7655029 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7655030 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7655031 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7655032 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7655033 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7655034 we bepalen zelf wel wanneer en of onze kinderen fruit eten
7655035 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7655036 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7655037 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7655038 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7655039 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7655040 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7655041 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7655042 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7655043 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7655044 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7655045 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7655046 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7655047 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7655048 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7655049 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7655050 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7655051 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7655052 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7655053 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7655054 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7655055 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7655056 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7655057 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7655058 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7655059 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7655060 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7655061 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7655062 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7655063 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7655064 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7655065 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7655066 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7655067 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7655099 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

7655162 likely that the name originally derisive was also used because many early friends like other religious enthusiasts themselves trembled i e quaked in their religious meetings and showed other physical manifestations of religious emotion
7655163 the society of friends or quakers is an unconventional but esteemed protestant body
7655164 they affirm the inner light the spiritual nerve center that in every person
7655165 classical friends deny the validity of clergy liturgy and sacraments
7655166 when all my hopes in churches were gone which said that is the inner voice or inner light based upon the description of john 1 9
7655167 this voice fox maintained and has nothing to do with the ceremonies rituals or creeds over which christians have fought is gods altar and shrine 140 141 emphasis mine
7655168 stresses a almost mystical knowledge of god and the workings of the lords within all people
7655169 i heard a voice which said that is the inner voice or
7655170 the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
7655171 is available to all and has nothing to do with the ceremonies
7655172 for from within come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery greed malice deceit lewdness envy slander arrogance and folly
7655173 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul your mind and with all your strength

7655177 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7655178 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7655179 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7655180 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7655181 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7655182 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7655183 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7655184 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying in birds and other smaller animals
7655185 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7655186 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7655253 the often conflicting financial services regulations issued by each nation create an ever shifting three dimensional maze for firms and investors that navigate global finance but with this inaugural agreement we have a groundbreaking map that will improve market access between the u s and australia and perhaps as importantly serve as a model for cooperation with additional non u s regulators
7655254 this important bilateral work must not eclipse or be a substitute for other reform efforts already underway rewriting rule 15a 6 is a necessary and vital change that will update existing regulations open our markets and ensure that american investors have access to the best services and opportunities globally

7655260 stranger lover the lost days are over while i walk from car to door something inward opens like four oclocks in rain earth cold from autumn pulls me i cant breathe the same with dirt for marrow and mist for skin blurring my vision my visions separate self i stand drunk in this glitter under the skys grey shelter the city maple not half so bitter hurls itself in two directions until both tips darken and disappear as i darken my reflection in the smoking mirror of my home how faint the sound of dry leaves like the clattering keys of another morning another world
7655261 for him i map this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer when it rains i remember his face in the corridor of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth his wrinkled forehead unguarded eyes the foreign fruit of an intricate sadness with the grace that remains i catch a glint around a door i cannot enter the clock echoes in dishtowels i search loves center and bang pans against the rubble of my day the lucid grandeur of wet ground the strangeness of a fatal sun that makes us mark on the margin of our loss trust in the gossamer of touch trust in the late plowed field
7655262 i remember the moon shimmering loss and discovery along a water edge and skirting a slice of carrot i welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn rare and real i dance while vegetables sing in pairs i hug my death my chorus of years and search and stretch and leap for i will be apprentice to the blood in spite of the mood of a world that keeps rusting rusting the wild throats of birds
7655263 hungry for silence i listen to wind to the sound of water running down mountain my own raw breath between the sounds a seaborn god plays his reed in the caverns of my being i wear his amethyst let go my dreams millars lacewings and junebugs scatter widen and batter the dark brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss and lets us forgive so that we can answer birds and deer lightning and rain shadow and hurricane truth waits in the creek cutting the winter brown hills it sings with needles of ice sings because of its scar

7655266 for six days i raced jack daniels he cheated told jokes some werent even funny thats how come he won it took a long time to reach this yellow river im not yet thirty or is it thirty one figured all my years carried the same hard thaw out here houselights hid deep inside the trees for awhile i believed this road cut across to spring creek and i was trucking home i could kid you now say i ran it clean gasping on one lung loaded by a knapsack of distrust and hesitation i never got the tone in all the talk of cure i sang honor songs crawled the railroad bridge to canada dizzy from the ties i hung between both worlds clans of blackbirds circled the nearby maple trees the dark heart of me said no days more than these as sundown kindled the sumacs stunned by the rivers smile i had no need for heat no need to feel ashamed inside me then the sound of burning leaves tell them i tumbled through a gap on the horizon no say i stumbled through a hummock and fell in a pit of stars when rain weakened my stride i heard them singing in a burl of white ash took a few more days to rave at them in this wood then their appaloosas nickered in the dawn and they came riding down a close ravine though the bottle was empty i still hung on foxtails beat the grimace from my brow until i took off my pain like a pair of old boots i became a hollow horn filled with rain reflecting everything the wind in my hand burned cold as hoarfrost when my grandfather nudged me and called out my lakota name
7655267 the reason why some countries have been challenged with economic downturns after hosting an olympics is that hosting cities are often very small

7655274 they are a very very strong physical team and a dfb cup game in front of their own fans is not one that can be compared to todays match they will present themselves very differently and we will need to be prepared for that

7655302 we dont want to lose hold of this wealth that is 6 000 metres deep
7655303 it is the wealth of the country it is the wealth of 190 million brazilians and we have to use this wealth to help the poor of the country
7655304 to resolve definitively the problem of education in this country to resolve the problems of millions of poor that are here and not leave it in the hands of half a dozen companies that think the petrol belongs to them
7655305 i think the government has two views about creating a new company
7655306 one of these is to have large control of the oil production and this a nationalist view to keep control of the oil production the other concern is about getting most of the profit from the oil
7655307 and this is before tupi for sure tupi and the pre salt area will increase those numbers mostly after 2013 but for sure we are going to get a bigger number than that
7655308 i think brazil will still carry on its programme of ethanol because ethanol is still cheaper than gasoline and so i dont think there is a contradiction
7655309 brazil will probably become a large exporter of oil products and keep developing bio fuels and bio energy because it is a very large resource in the country
7655310 brazil does not think that ethanol is a solution for the whole world in energy terms it only plays a small part
7655311 it is impossible to supply all the fuel used in the world from bio energy but it can play a very important role and is very important for developing countries that need new sources of revenue
7655312 i think brazil should take care not to have oil as the only financial resource and to also use this money to develop other industries

7655324 she obama certainly needs to convey some of her husbands themes this is about change
7655325 but she also needs to convey that shes not an unreasonable radical person that she has a mainstream message that she and her husband would bring to the campaign

7655327 spate of school expansions is no tonic for student proficiency

7655330 at west the number of students who posted proficient or advanced level scores declined by six percentage points in math seven in reading and language arts and eight in science eisenhower scores in each academic area saw a dip but smaller than at west from one percentage point in language arts to five in science

7655333 its a very strong core of our mission this news we received two weeks ago disrupts that mission
7655334 from the time of the crime for as long as we need to we can revisit that crime scene as we found it
7655335 people move objects move cars move we have those preserved
7655336 because of the multiple scan points they can come back and look at the crime scene from a different angle at a later date
7655337 before you just had the photo and two dimensional was how you took it at the crime scene then you had the crime scene sketch to over lay that on to try to get a perspective
7655338 i think the correlation is just the low income neighborhoods

7655349 the challenge for london is to create a party atmosphere with a great sporting experience
7655350 had it been us i dont think we would have necessarily done the switcheroo with the girl

7655373 iraq will not hold any agreement or treaty on the basis of one foreign soldiers presence on the iraqi lands but through putting a specified timetable for the withdrawal of the foreign troops
7655374 big progress is currently taking place in the iraqi u s negotiations to put the final touches on the mutual agreement
7655375 among the pending points in the negotiations is the issue of offering unlimited immunities
7655376 open immunities cannot be given to any person regardless he is iraqi or a foreigner
7655377 there is also the issue on foreign forces presence movements and bases
7655378 an agreement has been made that the end of 2011 would be the last date for foreign forces presence in iraq
7655379 meanwhile those forces are not allowed to conduct military missions unless with a clearance from the iraqi government
7655380 the agreement will be transparent and will be admitted to the iraqi parliament for approval
7655381 there will be no secrete appendixes for the agreement as some insincere politicians claim
7655382 very very close to finalizing the agreement but had not yet clinched the deal
7655383 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
7655384 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7655385 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7655386 the bolt issue i take with a big smile i gave him what i believe to be fatherly advice i stand by what i said he was the icon of the games together with michael phelps and i have great respect for his abilities but i repeat he should show more respect for his opponents but he is a young man of 22 and he has time to mature
7655387 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7655388 the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7655389 weve heard the criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill could be interpreted as instilling fetal right
7655390 this bill will be very clear and straightforward and the bill will not be misinterpreted
7655391 i could not be more proud of the men and women of this agency who made this possible
7655392 the idea is if i drove through california or louisiana or florida i should expect the same level of quality service and the same ethical standards

7655416 mr biden was instantly credited with the ability to appeal to white working class voters who voted for hillary clinton in the primaries but have balked at backing mr obama its been nearly three months since mr obama locked up the democratic nomination and those voters havent budged
7655417 i doubt if mrs clinton could persuade many of them to vote for mr obama even if she were the vice presidential candidate but mr biden whose presidential candidacies in 1988 and 2008 attracted embarrassingly little support wont have a chance hes never demonstrated any ability to influence the presidential choice of voters

7655421 the stylists politico spoke to while not enamored with bidens haircut thought the work had turned out well
7655422 i think he should darken the hair on the top of his head

7655438 theres about a 30 40 chance well test 90 again in 2009 ninety dollars for a barrel of oil and we think its low five years ago it would have been considered ridiculously high an outrage times change
7655439 in my economic models 90 a barrel is still high but it looks a heckuva lot better than 145 i can tell you that

7655460 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7655461 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7655462 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7655463 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7655464 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster

7655468 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7655469 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7655470 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7655471 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7655472 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7655473 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7655474 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7655475 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7655476 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7655477 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7655478 es una verdadera l stima que se halla roto el motor el auto ven a funcionando b rbaro hasta ese momento me queda la amargura de no haber podido cerrar el fin de semana como lo esperaba y la contracara de esto es lo bien que funcionamos durante el d a s bado y el saltito que peg el auto desde que arranqu es la primera vez que funcion tan bien el auto espero que para san luis nos podamos mantener dentro del mismo lote
7655479 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it

7655481 fue una final muy exigente pero cont bamos con un muy buen auto pudimos superar algunos autos y aprovechar los problemas de otros para llegar quintos que es un gran resultado para nosotros en el segundo tramo de la carrera quise ir por mas pero me fue imposible atacar a mart n ponte porque su auto ven a tirando mucho aceite y me imped a ver hacia adelante el trabajo realizado es muy bueno porque nos da confianza para seguir trabajando en pos de ascender en el campeonato agradezco al equipo por el gran trabajo realizado en la dodge y a los sponsor que nos acompa an
7655482 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7655483 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7655484 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7655485 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7655486 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7655487 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7655488 fuck duck fuck chicken fuck king prawn fuck beef fuck vegetable fuck frog fuck snake
7655489 im so looking forward to having a break and taking some time off
7655490 it was just really great to meet him and people of his calibre
7655491 im going to take the rest of the year off
7655492 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7655493 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7655494 i have every reason to believe hes going to be there so my cups half full
7655495 but its only half full because theres a chance he could miss the first one
7655496 to be able to play through those things and show up on sunday is something i take pride in
7655497 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7655498 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right

7655502 im from idaho dont you underestimate the damage your mother can do with a rock
7655503 the most valuable things in life are priceless they are courage compassion wisdom respect for ourselves and others and a host of characteristics that we call the beauty of the human spirit dont be afraid that your life will end be afraid that it will never begin
7655504 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7655505 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7655506 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7655507 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

7655513 the cost of fuel increased by 300 million in the past year despite fare increases air new zealand continues to only partially recover the increase in the total cost of fuel
7655514 the current challenges facing airlines are immense but the board is confident that air new zealand is in a good position to create and seize opportunities in both the domestic and international businesses
7655515 the spirit of invention and cross culture experimentation is at the heart of la food show
7655516 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia relations cannot be returned to their former state
7655517 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7655518 we would like these relations to be comprehensive and in the spirit of partnership
7655519 but if they in effect tear up that co operation then nothing terrible will happen to us
7655520 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7655521 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7655522 mediawhiz has bloggers and publishers that are outside of the us who sometimes have issues getting paid through checks

7655524 jappelle les dirigeants de la russie tre fid les leurs engagements de ne pas reconna tre ces r gions s paratistes

7655533 were going to collaborate with them on really expanding their markets because the woman they speak to is demographically a strong more subscriber
7655534 the psychographics look the same as well so were collaborating on the database side on the subscription side and really on the overall branding there are a lot of opportunities to cross promote between the two assets because we are so comparable and from my exposure to the smart talk audience they are so incredibly confident and connected and just vibrant and thats the market we speak to
7655535 meredith was a very logical choice for us to partner up with in that they have very strong pulse on a demographic that is a significant target relationship with smart talk patrons and the advertising base they bring is one that certainly is in need and looking for alternatives to print and alternatives to web to in fact tailor a communicated message to a particular customer base our patrons are probably the best in terms of demographics
7655536 over the course of years weve been doing this weve reached 1 million women who are influential in their communities families and relationships so this partnership gives meredith a focus group opportunity to talk to listen to and learn from 100 000 women throughout north america over the course of 6 months
7655537 that type of access and insight is incredible we provide a vehicle to tailor specific interactions and connections with customers rather than a blanket message that overshoots on both sides
7655538 we do not have any industrial arrangement with hal on commercial aircraft at this time and we do not comment on discussion with aerospace companies on future programmes
7655539 love life life is great oh my gosh so pretty how am i so lucky love my family etc etc etc
7655540 average daily consumption among males was 17 cigarettes per day while female daily smokers averaged 13 7 in 2007
7655541 my shows are much too important to risk on unknowns
7655542 you know christina i thought the most recent set of exercises you wrote were kinda lame i think you can do better on this
7655543 once the particles are deposited into the lungs they tend to accumulate theyre basically like ultra fine shards of glass that penetrate into the lung tissue and the body tries to attack it but it cant break them down
7655544 i dont want to see them in subdivisions i would like to see them in places where there is going to be a mine which is technically what gravel pits are they would have to comply with all the mining regulations
7655545 what that allows the developer to do is actually comply not with the regional district guidelines for developing land but with the mines act for gravel pits which have far fewer regulations so in effect by getting a mines permit the developer can dive under the rules set by the regional district to protect the environment
7655546 it may mean that we will have to pay more for gravel but at what point do we want to safeguard peoples health
7655547 the parking and road improvements are all part of the ground work that needs to take place before the terminal expansion begins
7655548 the people that attended our event were people that really needed the extra help during the back to school season it was so rewarding to see that our community made a difference
7655549 the united way raises funds for 39 local community partner agencies many of which are not able to promote themselves
7655550 they are also involved in promoting volunteerism and education within the community with their various programs all funds raised by united way stay in our community and cover a range of areas such as children seniors and the homeless
7655551 great group of people a good mix of experience and new perspectives
7655552 to be a spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of ones own life
7655553 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer

7655562 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7655563 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7655564 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7655565 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7655566 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7655567 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7655568 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7655569 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7655570 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7655571 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7655572 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7655573 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7655574 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7655575 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7655576 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7655577 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7655578 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7655579 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7655580 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7655581 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7655582 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7655583 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7655584 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know

7655594 the important thing is for him to be happy and im happy for him
7655595 at chelsea he certainly wasnt happy during two seasons and with three different coaches in charge someone like him who returns home does so with a lot of motivation
7655596 i also want to send a greeting to chelsea fans who in the last two years always made me feel their support thanks really for this
7655597 its not true that only silvio berlusconi the clubs owner insisted that andrei return
7655598 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy because it would be bad for his career
7655599 we want him to continue he has proved to be a very good coach
7655600 earlier this month i said beijing would be me finished

7655602 we were dreadful and way off the pace before the great response there was a lot at stake and we needed to get the job done

7655607 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7655608 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7655609 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
7655610 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

7655682 for a russian athlete nothing is bigger and more important than the olympic gold medal
7655683 in russia if you stop someone on the street and ask them what is a grand slam they cant tell you
7655684 but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger or more important than the olympic games for a sportsperson
7655685 there was a lot of people and a lot of flowers

7655699 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps

7655706 i was on the plane out of springfield with senator biden
7655707 hes a great choice senator biden has the combination of skills and personal story that make him well suited
7655708 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7655709 managing an endangered species and seeing it recover its so rare that were able to do that
7655710 by the time somethings listed as endangered theyre in such dire straits its so hard to bring them back at that point getting to that point unfortunately is a death sentence for many species
7655711 our goal is not to have them downlisted to threatened
7655712 its to have them off the list and in addition to having them delisted altogether its to repopulate their historic range

7655737 senator clinton supports senator obama and is urging all of her supporters to do the same
7655738 we do get nearly 20 of our power from nuclear so in a sense we are more of a nuclear nation than many people realize
7655739 we are but i do think that policy is drifting in that direction now that people are paying 4 a gallon for gas and increasingly are concerned and aware that we have spent a whole lot of time spinning our wheels and not breaking that addiction to foreign oil obviously the question especially for democrats is what do you do about the waste youve got the whole yucca mountain issue which has been tied up for a long time
7655740 opponents of domestic production cling to their position even as the price of foreign oil has doubled and doubled again the need for more production extends as well to another long neglected source of energy and that is nuclear power
7655741 in his third straight day of campaign speechmaking about energy and 4 a gallon gasoline mr mccain the presumptive republican nominee told the crowd at a town hall style meeting at missouri state university that he saw nuclear power as a clean safe alternative to traditional sources of energy that emit greenhouse gases
7655742 oil continues to account for more than 95 percent of all the energy used for transportation in the united states
7655743 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time

7655748 every gpu we make we always consider this type of design we do a reasoned analysis and we always conclude no thats why we havent built that type of machine
7655749 theyve put a lot of people behind this so clearly they believe its viable but the products on our roadmap are competitive to this thing as theyve painted it and the reality is going to fall short of the optimistic way theyve painted it
7655750 as blogger and cpu architect peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7655751 weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7655752 ati has had the benefit for a long time of seeing nvidias products and having something to shoot for
7655753 while nvidia has not had the benefit of having someone to be shooting after
7655754 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much
7655755 its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7655756 were being told that financially the only way to make this center work is for the post office to build it here

7655759 a big distribution center processing junk mail is not going to bring in the kind of high creative talent jobs were trying to bring here
7655760 if we could get 30 acres right along the highway for a reasonable price wed take it

7655762 we have identified the communities in orange county that this would serve its not going to people in the inland empire or los angeles its for people right here in orange county
7655763 we have employees that live and work in aliso viejo and we care about the community
7655764 im not surprised that they said the land wasnt for sale
7655765 but in real estate its all a matter of what the price is

7655775 fda proposed rule about drug label warning changes will lessen agencys power to protect us
7655776 i told you about a proposed rule that was issued in mid january by the fda
7655777 this action should reduce confusion about what our policy is clarify it and provide additional confidence to patients and doctors that information on medical product labels has a sensible scientific basis
7655778 doctors and patients look to the fda widely considered the worlds gold standard to provide them with balanced information
7655779 the final rule is going to give drug and device companies the ability to claim complete immunity for failing to warn about potentially hazardous side effects of prescription drugs and medical devices

7655930 it is a form of coercion that exploits vulnerable young people with underdeveloped decision making capabilities asking them to trade away their right to be free from beatings by school personnel
7655931 seemingly portrayed as a part of routine physical education amount to corporal punishment because of the intent to cause pain
7655932 the experience of being hit on the buttocks an inherently private part of the body can be particularly humiliating
7655933 its hard to know what to do about it other than to accept it and repair it rather than try to prevent it
7655934 when i say im interested in watching the web watch the convention what i think i mean is i want to see how the world live web works during an event of this magnitude and by not going and being in the center of the storm and instead watching and participating from a distance i am betting that it may be easier to see some of the larger patterns at work
7655935 its too expensive at 12 95 besides airlines are now reaming us for baggage costs and meals theres no way im going to hand over another 12 95 for internet access

7655945 i am not inspiring or inciting riots i am dreaming of riots in denver
7655946 sparking controversy again after he made comments that appear to call for riots in denver during the democratic national convention this summer
7655947 we do hopefully the right thing for the sake of this country were the only one in charge of our affairs we dont farm out our defense if we elect democrats and riots in denver at the democratic convention will see to it we dont elect democrats and thats the best damn thing that can happen to this country as far as i can think

7655956 omg i hope i dont wake up from this dream
7655957 this shit is going to be so bad that not even walmart will sell it in its discount bins
7655958 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7655959 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7655960 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7655961 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7655962 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7655963 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7655964 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7655965 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7655966 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from
7655967 sma is spinal muscular atrophy its a degenerative neuromuscular disease his muscles are ok and his nerves are ok but the protein that allows them to talk effectively arent there so only some of his muscles get the signal so he can still move his legs and his arms and things like that but theyre just not strong enough to sustain walking
7655968 when we got the diagnosis it was just boom it really was my mind went blank
7655969 they were always there to support us either just to talk to vent to talk about equipment needs
7655970 just having a network of support and people that you can call because theres not always a solution there really isnt always a solution but theres always a way to get through it with grace and dignity
7655971 we can still do pretty much what we want to do he can still do all the activities we just have to figure out a way to do it
7655972 they made some beach chairs at the beach that we use and they can float on water

7655998 dalawang araw yung show namin sa new jersey pero sa dalawang araw na yun ibati bang group of filipinos ang nandoon
7655999 very convenient din kasi yung hotel namin tabi lang ng venue at binigyan din kami ng panahon para makapag shopping kumbaga sa umaga may oras kami dahil sa hapon lang naman at sa gabi yung event kaya ako yung mga last few days na ako nakapagpahinga
7656000 yung tickets lang talaga sobra kasing daming sponsors maraming dapat pagbigyan like ako sa ni request ko is only 10 percent of what i requested si mommy nga medyo namomroblema rin ngayon kasi marami rin ang nanghihingi sa kanya kahit ako personally marami pang nakalagay sa inbox ko na nanghihingi sa akin at napangakuan ko na rin pero wala hindi ko pa alam kung anong magagawa at kung may magagawa pa ba
7656001 ako kasi bihira na akong gumawa ng dance number as in matagal na gusto ko rin ibalik yun pero this time ibang klaseng pagsasayaw naman hindi naman hip hop its something to look forward kahit ako isa ito sa inaabangan ko
7656002 pero karamihan si marian talaga ang sasayaw siyempre kaming dalawa may mga song numbers kami a couple of dance numbers generally its a high energy show so masaya to
7656003 well ang sa akin lang alam nyo napakaliit ng industriya natin we should give credit doon sa mga talents na nagkakaroon ng opportunity like with richard and kc they have an opportunity to do a movie together and kami ni marian may opportunity rin to do to this kind of show so sana instead of giving a different meaning to it di ba sana lets just support each other konti na nga lang tayo sa industriya pero gawin nating makulay

7656005 ako hindi hindi talaga actually wala naman kaming kinalaman diyan maraming factors involved nandiyan ang araneta coliseum ang gma basta kami we will just do our best on that event and we are also looking forward to their upcoming movie
7656006 instead of giving a different meaning to it sana lets just support each other
7656007 exaggerated ang reaction sa aswang issue pokwang mas grabeng manlait
7656008 well let me find out if this is possible stay here and i will be right back
7656009 we expect the number of downgrades to exceed upgrades for the rest of 2008 and probably in 2009 as business and financial challenges squeeze operating margins and weaken balance sheets
7656010 much of the operating pressure on the industry that we first observed in the fiscal year 2006 medians has continued into 2007 and we expect these pressures to continue in the next fiscal year especially given the materially weaker economy
7656011 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7656012 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7656013 i said as much to him three or four days ago i said
7656014 she joked about the frustrations of living through the presidency of george w
7656015 honest to goodness how many times can you yell at the tv screen
7656016 let there be no mistake about it we are united we are united for change and we are united behind barack obama and joe biden and we are gong to make sure that we win on november 4th
7656017 we are gathered here in denver for a very clear and simple purpose and that is to come out of this convention energized excited and ready to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
7656018 if you voted for me you have much more in common with senator obama on every issue i campaigned on on every cause that i have stood for than you do with senator mccain
7656019 i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack and joe biden as you worked for me
7656020 sono terrorizzato da te e vorrei che mi lasciassi stare
7656021 i miei amici non hanno visto la vera india e non ci stiamo incontrando in una conferenza nel cuore della vera india
7656022 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7656023 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7656024 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7656025 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7656026 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7656027 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7656028 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7656029 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7656030 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7656031 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7656032 how do you gently convince a person that their god doesnt exist and they wont be going to heaven when they die
7656033 it literally takes place 20 minutes after casino royale ends
7656034 we pick the story up obviously with james bond out for revenge on a personal vendetta it then gets more complicated than that
7656035 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7656036 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7656037 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7656038 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7656039 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7656040 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7656041 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7656042 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household
7656043 since i was about 18 or 19 theyve been my favorite band
7656044 i loved lowell george the way he played and sang and the funkiness of their records
7656045 we are busying can you come to report it few days later
7656046 we need more money floating on market so lets rise the tax

7656049 we could see further weakness gnaw at the markets over the next few weeks as weaker demand aggravates the excess supply problem
7656050 opec production was running well above official quotas set for the cartels members
7656051 i would like to see the employee handbook be a positive tool
7656052 on june 22 2008 lynda jones was reading the sunday beaumont enterprise and recognized that the dwelling at 1179 evalon was on defendants june 24 2008 council agenda for approval to order the structure to be demolished and removed
7656053 with these facts as stated we would like to be able to do the repairs that are needed so that we may be able to put and keep a roof over our head this would also be another devastating loss to us
7656054 may be paid a kickback based on the additional finance charge associated with the rate spread
7656055 plaintiff acted in reliance on the misrepresentation and suffered injury
7656056 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7656057 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7656058 it is really nice to come home to a nice reception and theres nothing better than coming home
7656059 im going to have a really nice long break and decide what i want to do just do all the things that i havent been able to do and then decide when i want to get back in the pool
7656060 ive had a really hard run but ive had a fantastic time in beijing and i have a beautiful piece of silver hanging around my neck and now that weve finally touched down in sydney its such a great feeling
7656061 swimmers get up really early every day so itll be really nice to stay in bed as long as i want
7656062 everyone was taking photos of each other on the flight and it was really good fun
7656063 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market
7656064 technicals have a consolidative look and there is no fresh fundamental news of any consequence to move the markets
7656065 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7656066 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence
7656067 we will not easily arrest people if they dont break any law
7656068 the persecution of religious believers is very much alive in china and ongoing regardless of the fact that the olympics games has just been held in china
7656069 the u s and india stand shoulder to shoulder in their desire for a clean exception and we will continue to work with our indian partners to persuade the nsg countries that such an exemption is in the international communitys best interest
7656070 continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg governments
7656071 substantive amendments with a view to increasing the level of comfort with the proposed exemption
7656072 are based on concepts already enshrined in u n security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg participating governments and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which nsg states have concluded over the years
7656073 the judges should have been reinstated on aug 19 the day after musharrafs resignation
7656074 now it is being said that agreements are not binding like the quran
7656075 nawaz sharif has been too inflexible on the judges issue
7656076 where mr sharif proved that his politics had no room for flexibility mr zardari showed to the world that his definition of ethics in politics was somewhat different from that held by most others
7656077 we made a mistake by signing an agreement to restore the judges
7656078 once you make a mistake the problem is that you keep repeating it
7656079 zardari is more ruthless and more cunning it was a display of realpolitik he doesnt give a damn about agreements he wants to consolidate his government he will lose popularity but popularity matters six months before an election not six months after it
7656080 our time has now come zardari will be our president
7656081 from the american point of view that would be a plus there will be one man sitting in the presidency who can handle all the decisions
7656082 the americans are concerned about sharifs closeness to religious parties
7656083 sharif represents a very important constituency and his support would have been helpful by isolating him there is a risk of isolating his base
7656084 most people in this country i dont think will be happy with it given mr zardaris reputation
7656085 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7656086 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7656087 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7656088 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7656089 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7656090 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7656091 ive heard nothing but rave reviews when i was along the route most people i talked to wanted it done every weekend in the summer
7656092 if someone is coming to buy luggage theyre generally going to bring a car
7656093 some of these alibis are clever and a few of them are justifiable by the facts this book is about investments you could substitute money with another thing and it still makes sense the world wants to know only one thing have you achieved success
7656094 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7656095 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7656097 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns

7656099 sudanese forces faced huge resistance with a large number of citizens blocking the entry of the forces with barricades civilians were brought into the streets as human shields
7656100 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate
7656101 the government sent a strong military force and attacked the camp with the intention of killing civilians
7656102 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection
7656103 i am very certain that people at fifa and the confederation of african football caf are understanding enough not to sanction such a match
7656104 if anything we will still be mourning our president since the period has now been extended to 21 days
7656105 its our prayer as government that our request will be heard
7656106 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7656107 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7656108 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7656109 its going to be a heavy lift it takes time in our system
7656110 anything that raises the price of electricity is going to be a political problem
7656111 security forces had to open fire when protesters attacked them with stones and sticks
7656112 discourage separatist rallies during which residents have openly paraded green islamic flags and chanted pro militant and anti india slogans
7656113 we are not even being allowed to peep out through windows
7656114 we have called in the army to assist the police in enforcing curfew

7656119 fiddle dee dee war war war this war talks spoiling all the fun at every party this spring
7656120 most consumers do not trust the advertising regardless of channel or format
7656121 our forecast anticipates seismic shifts in the use of rapidly changing technology and its effect on consumers who increasingly rely on its interactivity for making brand choices
7656122 means your best and worst customers now have a greater share of trusted voice than you can amass through conventional media
7656123 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists
7656124 in all the inspections we have not detected any problem that affects security or a link with cost cutting policies
7656125 the airline put pressure on mechanics for them to authorise planes to take off even if they were not ready
7656126 flights and planes are absolutely safe and respect all operational security standards
7656127 at spanair no pilot faces pressure to fly a plane that does not meet all the standards of operational security
7656128 the operation only took a few minutes and apart from the threat of their weapons the robbers did not commit violence against the ships occupants
7656129 nor were they interested in the wallets or the jewels
7656130 they arent known personalities but people with a solid financial foundation
7656131 cascade county wind putting the wind to work for montanans

7656137 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7656138 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7656139 reflecting the 2008 operating performance while recognising the importance of maintaining financial flexibility through what promises to be a period of significant adjustment for the airline industry
7656140 the cost of fuel increased by 300 million in the past year despite fare increases air new zealand continues to only partially recover the increase in the total cost of fuel
7656141 the current challenges facing airlines are immense but the board is confident that air new zealand is in a good position to create and seize opportunities in both the domestic and international businesses
7656142 we have been there for the best part of 100 years and a lot of people depend on us for their food if nothing else
7656143 we recognized that by not addressing reliability issues many companies were failing in their attempts to implement lean subsequently they abandon lean and become even more vulnerable to offshore competition
7656144 keep offers and specials out of your loyalty initiatives for b2b its different its about value because they probably already have a discounted rate
7656145 if you were assured that we would not sell directly to end users and that we would help you drive sales would you participate in this program
7656146 sellers fear they will lose control of their marketing message and lose sales
7656147 marketers should focus more on timing than privacy offering the products at the right time is the next frontier of relevance for marketers
7656148 este meu bem van gogh considerado um dos melhores pintores do mundo
7656149 andar nesta bienal com estes saltos eu devia ter vindo com os sapatos de feira
7656150 era meio louco vivia solto pelos campos pintando sem parar at que um dia num acesso mais forte deu um tiro no peito
7656151 quem fez o papel foi aquele kirk douglas n o foi

7656153 the kind of sf that i like best the kind with aliens and spaceships and planets and more tech than we have but not unimaginable incomprehensible tech
7656154 to be living in a world where these spheres float in
7656155 gij zult geen voorrang nemen op banen waar gij geen voorrang hebt
7656156 gij zult niet doen alsof ge doof zijt als een auto al een halfuur toeterend achter u rijdt omdat ge op de baan fietst ipv op het fietspad
7656157 were able to use more sophisticated techniques that the federal government has access to that a lot of times local law enforcement doesnt have access to
7656158 it helps to be able to go into a neighborhood and dismantle the whole group instead of just one person at a time
7656159 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7656160 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7656161 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7656162 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7656163 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7656164 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7656165 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7656166 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7656167 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack the supreme court is at stake our educational system needs the right kind of change weve got to become energy independent we have to create millions of new green collar jobs weve got so much work to do around the world
7656168 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7656169 this convention provides a very important opportunity for the obama campaign to bond with the constituencies that supported hillary clinton
7656170 its not about barack or hillary its about bringing in the people here who voted for hillary rodham clinton senator obama and senator biden are without question qualified to do that
7656171 it would be like filling up a quarter of every water bottle with oil
7656172 an indolent child who is spoiled by his boyfriend sad vapid

7656176 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7656177 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7656178 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7656179 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7656180 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7656181 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7656182 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass

7656184 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7656185 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7656186 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7656187 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7656188 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7656189 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7656190 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7656191 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7656192 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7656193 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7656194 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7656195 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7656196 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7656197 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7656198 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7656199 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7656200 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7656201 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace

7656248 we were asked to come up and give a general overview on the oilsands and canadas role in the world of energy in general which we did
7656249 they were exercising curiosity basically saying wow this is neat
7656250 its astounding to me frankly the calibre of these individuals to just seem to arrive quietly in our community
7656251 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them
7656252 only when the last tree has died and the last river has been poisoned and the last fish has been caught will we realize we cant eat money
7656253 someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago
7656254 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7656255 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7656256 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7656257 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7656258 i dont have an answer for that question right now
7656259 i talked to athletic trainer richie bancells and richie says for the comments that hes made or the lack of comments hes made well have dr wilckens look at him

7656267 the only bridge into the motorcamp was getting up and was getting logs and debris blocking it and it was not certain if it was going to overflow
7656268 i turned around and there was this guy swinging at everyone we saw him back my friend against the wall
7656269 and the rain will kill us all throw ourselves against the wall
7656270 stripping everything away from our lives assumptions preconceptions fears and dreams and then keeping only the things that we truly value its about being happy with enough and finding contentment from within
7656271 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7656272 we are united on behalf of the democratic party the values we hold dear the reason why we work so hard in politics to make the changes that we know will matter in the lives of hard working americans and for the future of our children

7656275 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7656276 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7656277 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7656278 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7656279 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7656280 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7656281 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7656282 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7656283 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7656284 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7656285 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7656286 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7656287 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7656288 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7656289 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7656290 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7656291 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7656292 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7656293 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalized form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7656294 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7656295 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7656296 its too expensive at 12 95 besides airlines are now reaming us for baggage costs and meals theres no way im going to hand over another 12 95 for internet access
7656297 i dont care its the principle of it im tired of getting reamed by airlines for every little cost now and im not paying for it

7656312 but the networks cant not be here which is a problem not a terrific amount of news is going to happen we have to be here in case something does happen its the same reason we send reporters down to crawford to sit there during the presidents vacation in case something does happen
7656313 a south side girl from a working family her parents worked very hard sacrificed in order to give her the kind of education she received and her brother craig they have a very close nuclear family her father who is no longer with us was an inspiration to her in terms of her values and work ethic and her commitment to this country that had treated her so well

7656323 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them to reiterate our processes and efforts to date indicate that packages obtained by red hat enterprise linux subscribers via red hat network are not at risk
7656324 while there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories we have decided to convert to new fedora signing keys

7656339 we are selectively blocking six different neurotransmitters and investigating the impacts these blockers have on the motor evoked potentials meps

7656393 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7656394 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7656395 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7656396 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7656397 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7656398 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds

7656412 the governor believes its important to tout montana and one way he does that is by communicating the law was not designed to stop the governor from asking the people of montana to thank farmers and ranchers
7656413 since the complaint was filed schweitzer has turned down requests to do psas to promote the butte folk festival to be in a video production greeting montana troops in iraq to congratulate montana high school graduates and to appear with the u s surgeon general to discourage under age drinking

7656424 thats impressive it must have taken a lot of effort
7656425 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7656426 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
7656427 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
7656428 my message was you took an oath and you dont have to agree or disagree with the law you took an oath to uphold the law
7656429 well leave it to the courts to litigate what the law is but once the courts have ruled if youve taken an oath under the constitution you have to follow your oath
7656430 i personally didnt feel that same sex marriages were marriages if they were civil unions i dont think that would have bothered me but i personally didnt feel they were marriages i just didnt want to be officiating at one of those ceremonies
7656431 within hours of the november 18 2003 supreme judicial court decision legalizing gay marriage governor romney publicly denounced the courts ruling and affirmed traditional marriage
7656432 and that was just the beginning of his support for preserving traditional marriage
7656433 governor romney could not have been more public or vocal in his opposition to same sex marriage during his entire tenure as governor
7656434 he did not create same sex marriage that responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the massachusetts supreme judicial court for which chief justice margaret marshall has been pleased to accept full credit and responsibility
7656435 the courts landmark ruling established same sex marriage by judicially redefining the meaning of the word marriage
7656436 this final judicial order in the form of a declaratory judgment on may 17 2004 was what created same sex marriage in massachusetts
7656437 any administrative policies and procedures relative to solemnizing same sex marriages were carried out only as a direct result of the judiciarys final action in goodridge on may 17 2004
7656438 governor romney is pro individual and pro traditional marriage period
7656439 well you know ive not probably been an advocate for him in that position and you know i am going to let him defend himself and i dont want to relive the primary but i think that that was a very unfortunate position that he took in saying that well i cant do anything about it oh yes you can
7656440 he could have stopped it and should have stopped it
7656441 i respect the courts decision and as governor i will uphold its ruling
7656442 also as i have said in the past i will not support an amendment to the constitution that would overturn this state supreme court ruling

7656449 it was approved 70 30 and i supported that decision
7656450 my goodness it is a wonderful performance it brought tears to my eyes
7656451 gripping michael yorks narration and voices in dialect are top drawer artistry and bring the drama and environment and the ambience of the victorian era into such a realm that one is completely absorbed transported back to that time to live the experiences of the characters john bell youngs playing is sensitive and powerful i have found it one of the most moving audio experiences ive encountered the production is a gem
7656452 a passionate performance york throws himself into tennysons melodrama and his expertise with english accents deftly differentiates between the working class enoch and the bourgeois miller who marries his wife young brings a great sense of conviction to the 66 minute performance first class packaging too
7656453 a stunning new recording very different from any enoch ive ever heard a subtle and inward performance a heck of a fine pianist a bargain for a performance of this quality for a work of this stature a terrific recording
7656454 it is clear from the detail included in this production that it was a labor of love pianist john bell young was eager to record both the poem and the music richard strauss wrote specifically for it he brought british actor michael york on board and the two wrote essays for liner notes that nearly amount to a book the entire poem is also included as well as biographies of all involved and the history of the poem if you are not acquainted with the story with its contradictions and bitter ironies then this passionate and quite beautiful production makes for the perfect introduction york displays the crisp diction and precise pacing that keep him frequently employed as an audio book narrator he approaches the material with the appropriate degree of warmth and vigor but does so with great finesse matching the spirit of the material without overstating the obvious strausss music as presented by young is vital and undeniably dramatic
7656455 here is one of the more peculiar rarities in the strauss corpus a sprawling accompaniment to alfred lord tennysons melodrama about a young man presumably lost at sea who returns home many years later to find his wife remarried to his childhood friend remarkably two labels are competing with new recordings of enoch arden at the same time each with differing approaches yorks intimate conversational telling of the tale works far better on a recording and youngs playing is freer in manner
7656456 enoch arden is seldom performed and the few recordings include one by pianists glenn gould and claude rains as narrator english actor michael york and american pianist john bell young have just recorded it in an expressive rendition that matches the dynamic contours of the music york conveys an array of vocal colors with clarity and dramatic energy young captures the changing moods with rhythmic momentum and subtle changes as the text progresses the chemistry between york and young can be heard in the pensive opening measures and it continues throughout the piano intensity is beautifully balanced with the narrative the charisma attention to detail and intimacy of this disk make it something to share with friends

7656486 it was really overwhelming when i read for michael mann
7656487 i dont know if its because hes european or what but he was very social
7656488 hes just a very cool guy very humble with no ego at all
7656489 every night you had to do your best there was no room for error
7656490 he is a legend for a reason he pushed me to my limit and made me the professional that i am today
7656491 what we do is we celebrate all things improvisation and sketch comedy
7656492 we show off that south florida has a great improv scene and comedy scene
7656493 you have to try to keep doing things to draw people in im really surprised its taken off
7656494 we have 90 year olds we have 21 year olds and everybody enjoys the show on the same level this was something that south florida needed
7656495 we started this as an opportunity to really grow this community by exposing them to great shows and having local people take classes you know a lot of people are struggling actors they dont have the money to fly to new york or to chicago which is the mecca of improvisation or to los angeles and take a class for six weeks
7656496 ive learned a lot about how to just be yourself because when you get into acting you learn a lot about becoming a different person but in improv you get to really kind of be yourself in a way you get to use your own energy implement your own personality your own style into any scene that comes about
7656497 where can you go to find the newest the latest the greatest the best of whats going on in improvisation
7656498 how do we then sprinkle that seed among the improv community here and watch things grow
7656499 because if you miss that one week you miss the festival for a whole year
7656500 every two to three months were going to have an event and thats gonna recharge the batteries and get us going
7656501 the improv community down here is phenomenal its doing great we here at just the funny are teaching four levels of improv classes a lot of that is based on what weve learned at festivals
7656502 the most important thing you can do is listen listen doesnt just mean hear it means observe slow it down look around improvisation is about sharing information
7656503 when youre practicing improv you have to be in the moment because thats when it really works
7656504 you have to listen to one another and take those skills and apply them to life being onstage is like an added benefit like icing on the cake

7656547 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7656548 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7656549 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7656550 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7656551 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7656552 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

7656557 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions

7656559 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
7656560 the tools needed to compromise an accurate vote could be as simple as tampering with the paper audit trail connector or using a magnet with a digital assistant
7656561 the quality of the voting machines provided by these vendors is so poor far below what wed even expect in consumer electronics
7656562 if this kind of failure rate happened to our toaster ovens we would be outraged
7656563 lobbying is a big part of the problem not only here in new york state but all around the country
7656564 the voting machine vendors saw a big big pile of cash from the hava and moved in on all the states
7656565 year in and year out we see the same mistakes in ballot design with the same results
7656566 raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner

7656568 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7656569 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7656570 this is significant in two ways one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of embryo derived stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells

7656576 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists
7656577 today the parliament was doing the paperwork on what has happened de facto russia has formally acknowledged that it is a protector of south ossetia and abkhazia
7656578 the parliament is so dependent on the kremlin that i am sure it was ordered by medvedevs administration to back the independence bids
7656579 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7656580 i am positive that europe and the u s will respond in a reasonable manner the u s economic situation is not good russia is on the rise
7656581 it created a competition between the two sides with one side trying to deal with these conflicts and the other wanting to blow them up
7656582 we have to state once again that russia has never given its consent to a replacement of russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone with
7656583 it was a vote of strategic significance for modern history
7656584 russia has shown that it feels responsible for the security in the region and adopted a role of the guardian of contemporary international law
7656585 what theyre doing is annexing parts of an emerging european democracy
7656586 this will only increase russias international isolation the russians are shooting themselves in the foot
7656587 we had just let him out for the morning and he ran into the yard and started barking his head off
7656588 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7656589 every time we got something to dry land the river would rise and things would start to float away again people who have lived here for 30 40 years said theyve never seen it like that
7656590 the water had nowhere to go it went into the rivers and now its going to take a lot of time for that water to run through the system
7656591 the bottom line is that the state ends up spending more than we bring in
7656592 fay has caused millions of dollars of damage and our fellow floridians need help
7656593 today is the anniversary of the landfall of hurricane andrew in 1992
7656594 we still have a little more hurricane season to go
7656595 die 30d ist voll schlecht ich frag mich wie ich mit der gute bilder machen konnte die 40d ist viel besser
7656596 sen hillary clinton was our first choice and that of 18 million primary voters but presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obamas pick joe biden is a friend of women and a strong selection for vice president
7656597 that last 18 percent will move over when they see hillary and bill clinton at the convention campaigning for obama and on the stump for obama
7656598 is it sort of an ill show you or is it much more on the issues
7656599 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance responsibility lies with us all

7656602 ever since atmel introduced the worlds first serial flash in 1997 we have been a consistent leader in serial flash memories and have continued to work diligently to align our product roadmaps with our customers ensuring that we define the right products to meet their future design needs
7656603 the at25df081 is a clear case in which we listened to our customers and developed a product that allows them to design their applications to be smaller lighter and last longer all at a lower cost and without sacrificing performance
7656604 with its dual sh 4a high performance 32 bit risc cpu cores each of which delivers up to 960 mips performance the sh7786 can process complex data at high speeds for excellent application response it readily meets the requirements of next generation car navigation systems that have functions such as graphical display capabilities high quality audio reproduction and image recognition the faster data transfer capabilities of the new chip help ensure that the users experience is exceptionally impressive while the decreased power consumption eliminates the need to build bigger power supplies increase heat sink size and use larger power wires
7656605 besides car navigation systems we expect that this processor will be advantageous to customers that are producing game consoles digital home electronics and industrial equipment among other applications
7656606 so den tell me woil oi was clappin moi hands how many of yer family doid
7656607 a random solicitation of books from a random person to random people who actually pays attention to things like that
7656608 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7656609 sorry god just a little pun there no blasphemy intended
7656610 you know why you pay 80 a month for 200 cable channels you dont watch government policies dont allow you to pick and choose the channels you want to watch even though the technology is available you can choose an individual plan for your cell phone but the government forces everyone to have a one size fits all plan for cable its time to take cable out of the hands of bureaucrats and lobbyists and back where it belongs the customer
7656611 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7656612 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7656613 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7656614 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7656615 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7656616 alarmed by reports of russias plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7656617 we reminisce ray allen drops career high 54 points vs utah
7656618 many of our children cannot read write or express themselves well in english or in any one of our local languages the same difficulty exists in the area of science and technology the fact of the matter is that our education system is in crisis
7656619 it is clear that something different needs to happen otherwise we will continue to slowly but surely create a huge class of unemployed undereducated disenchanted and potentially destructive young men and women who will also constitute the majority of the population
7656620 we do not have free and compulsory education of any type in ghana
7656621 for education to be useful and productive we must have the right facilities motivated teachers healthy children and attentive parents this ingredients are not available in our system today in any consistent manner
7656622 i want to implement what our constitution demands free compulsory basic education and even go beyond to add continuous education to senior high school
7656623 education has proven to be an equalizing factor throughout the world and developed countries have used it as a means of accelerating economic and social growth
7656624 the cpp aims to create a just and disciplined society with a passion for excellence and the ability to move from the third world with all its social injustices to the first world with opportunities for every boy and girl
7656625 the multitude of flag bearers tabled to participate in the presidential debate makes it a stage for comical performance instead of a platform for academic discourse
7656626 in ghana elections over the past 16 years have established the npp and the ndc as the dominant political parties we must therefore concentrate on these two for meaningful impact
7656627 the worry has been compounded by the fact that ceremonial and principal streets within the cities have not been spared
7656628 government will like to advise all persons in the affected areas to continue to work toward and harmony respect and mutual trust to bring about the needed development to the area
7656629 the campaign teams will update the electorate about the good policies of the government and what it intends to initiate to bring remarkable improvement in the lives of the people
7656630 i have not added anything to who i am i am still asong komla i have not become taller bigger or any superior to anybody
7656631 you exhibited a rare sense of a leader and a traditional ruler
7656632 you parted with 16 plots four acres of parcel of land to the e p church to pave the way for a school project
7656633 this shows volumes the contemporary leader you are and one who also understands the positive impact education brings to bear on his people
7656634 constitutional democracy goes with the rule of law which also goes with democratic policing police of the people for the people and by the people
7656635 please forgive me dear one for not yet responding to you yes i did read your sweet and loving comment and your e mail thats all ive been able to do so far i havent been able to respond to the comment of yours on my blog yet and i dont like to post comments on my blog if i cant immediately respond to them if theyre ones that really require a response that is because that makes the readers of my blog and the one leaving the comments feel like their input is useless and like they wont ever get a response back therefore i thought the wise thing to do would be then to read all my comments post the ones i can at that moment and asap get back to the ones i cant then responding to them asap however i see that wasnt the wise way to handle it as i see how youre hurt and i fully understandi cant tell you how very sorry i am and how burdened i am knowing that i hurt you this is a very busy season in my familys life right trying to get everything prepared for starting up our homeschool stuff again here in a couple weeks we have various activities weve got two trips coming up im preparing a baby blanket for my brand new little cousin who we will be visiting for the first time during our first trip coming up etc etc im not saying all this to try to justify myself or excuse my foolish folly away im simply trying to give you a glimpse into my life so that you can know without a shadow of a doubt that im not ignoring you or wanting to somehow post only comments that are to my liking etc nothing could be further from the truth and so im trying to help you see that i ask you to please look further on my blog i post many comments that i disagree with not that i was disagreeing with yours i wasnt i partake in christian debate often but i have to choose whats most important in these busy times and thats my family if im going to have a blog speaking out on how we young ladies should serve our families then i have to live that out not just talk about it on my blog and then not actually practice what i preach there have been times where ive felt so obligated to all the numerous people on my blog that i have let family responsibilities go by the way side and i cant do that thats not pleasing to the lord he doesnt want me on the computer all day but of course neither does he want me ignoring my dear treasured readers and trust me there have been times where ive felt like breaking down because i feel so overwhelmed i feel like i have huge obligations to everybody and wonder how in the world i can fit them all in this has warn me thin at times therefore im trying to go about these issues in a wiser manner however i see from your hurting e mail that i failed im sorry i never meant to hurt you or anyone else i still have other numerous comments i still must get to and respond to im just trying to find the time to without letting anything slip through the cracks i want to serve my family like i am biblically commanded to and yet i also have a calling from the lord to minister to my readers i understand that i should have sent at least a short e mail to you to assure you that i was interested it was very very unwise for me to not do that i see that now i should have seen it then and im terribly sorry i pray that this e mail has patched things up i truly am so sorry i cant apologize enough if theres anything i can do let me know i look forward to hearing from you in the future dear i would like more information about the vision you have for your project and what it would be about once again i am sorry please accept my humble apology and please pray for me that i would be more skilled in time management in the future
7656636 politics of insults personality attacks accusations and counter accusations especially between leading members and functionaries of new patriotic party npp and national democratic congress ndc are unhealthy for the entrenchment of democracy in the country
7656637 we must speak out now against political ills irrespective of the political party involved or we all risk perishing through electoral conflicts
7656638 flight attendants i mean do they really need something else to deal with
7656639 weve been working for a solution to help people be productive on flights whether thats watching a movie or e mailing or doing business
7656640 youre free to surf wherever you want to but theres peer pressure and the presence of flight attendants
7656641 american has a clear code of conduct with passengers if people are viewing pornography being the best example it is something american is empowering flight attendants to deal with
7656642 there is no way we can take on any additional responsibility here
7656643 we see pornography on occasion if theyre in a place where no one can see it well on a plane we have to approach it if its visible and we have before
7656644 thats on rare occasions but now with internet as you increase opportunity well well see it more
7656645 you can well imagine a parent flying with a child seated next to somebody in the extreme case seated next to somebody watching pornography
7656646 theres always going to be someone who probably steps over the line whats interesting is the question is how do we deal with this person
7656647 our flight attendants will listen if there are complaints theyre observant and trained and if they see something inappropriate theres a discreet way to discuss it with the passenger and ask the passenger to put it away and usually thats what happens
7656648 we cant kick someone off an airplane when were flying along so we have to keep things under control which sometimes means confronting uncomfortable situations
7656649 we are safety and security professionals thats our first priority but we have to manage a whole range of other issues not related to safety and security but that in an escalated situation could become a safety and security issue
7656650 if your own comfort has been disrupted then you need to speak to a flight attendant about it
7656651 as much id love to say that anyone can do what they want at any time in small spaces like that you cant go anywhere
7656652 theres no exit like on a train you can get off you can change cars on a plane the next stop is 3600 feet below you
7656653 just as most people have come to set boundaries for cell phone use in public settings we will see them develop social norms for using the internet in flight
7656654 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7656655 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7656656 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7656657 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7656658 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7656659 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7656660 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7656661 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7656662 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7656663 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7656664 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7656665 if you are hurt you forgive us lets write together a chapter of the new pakistan i admit that you are hurt we apologize for tha t
7656666 for the sake of democracy for the sake of pakistan

7656670 we expect the number of downgrades to exceed upgrades for the rest of 2008 and probably in 2009 as business and financial challenges squeeze operating margins and weaken balance sheets
7656671 much of the operating pressure on the industry that we first observed in the fiscal year 2006 medians has continued into 2007 and we expect these pressures to continue in the next fiscal year especially given the materially weaker economy
7656672 moreover limelights slowing revenue growth lack of profitability heightened content delivery network rivalry and emerging competitive threats add to our uneasiness with the stock
7656673 more clarity on these legal matters or at the very least greater conviction that limelights profit outlook is improving
7656674 users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high
7656675 if a link or a message seems weird dont click on it
7656676 we oppose the hosting of the israel apartheid week at our institution and request that the administration stop this hateful and divisive event from returning to our university in future years
7656677 the university believes that free speech is a fundamental role of any university in a free society but allowing for free speech doesnt mean that we turn a blind eye to whatever is being said
7656678 i havent gotten a line out of vegas but id say pretty good
7656679 thats part of the thought process to have multiple guys that can fill in
7656680 you saw last week we worked a lot of guys in a lot of different spots in the secondary to build that flexibility
7656681 i was kind of shocked but i knew most of the stuff
7656682 it was just a matter of going out there seeing it and knowing what to do
7656683 being in the back end is a little different from being on the corner on the island the whole time so you have to get used to it
7656684 i think i played good there are always things you can improve on but overall i feel like i played really well
7656685 all you have to do is look at the tape and improve on the things you need to improve on so you can keep setting the bar high
7656686 i look at it as its a situation for me just coming in and competing its really not up to me whether im a starter or im a backup
7656687 the only thing i can control is what i do day in and day out
7656688 i think that comes from understanding what the other guys are supposed to do too and understanding where you fit into the defense and what we are trying to execute and what we are trying to get done with the defenses that are getting called
7656689 you get to a certain point where you feel like you can anticipate what our coach is going to call
7656690 shaping up to be one of the best fantasy jrpgs out this year
7656691 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7656692 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7656693 we realize that over the last week or 10 days that john mccain has had a 12 and 0 run here in this basketball game but we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7656694 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7656695 the public are sick and tired of this government pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals
7656696 the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7656697 presents the opportunity to recognize and enforce rights that are at least as basic and essential to human autonomy the right to worship and the right not to be tortured
7656698 all four petitioners were held and interrogated under appalling conditions in afghanistan by the united states before they were transported to guantanamo where they were systemically tortured and abused pursuant to directives from respondent rumsfeld and the

7656702 my child i too have paid attention to the problems of the universe i too have judged that happiness is in my tail but i have noticed that whenever i chase it it runs away from me but when i go about my business it just seems to come after me wherever i go

7656705 turkey adopted an action plan in 1998 regarded with opening to africa to boost actual relations with the african countries and has been in an effort to improve relations with the african continent and african countries within the framework of this plan in the past 10 years turkey has given a high importance to establish legal infrastructure of bilateral relations within the scope of this action plan encouraged bilateral relations and activities and finally turkish government announced 2005 as africa year to add a new momentum to relations
7656706 within the scope of cooperation between its institutions turkey continued its works for the 400 page national document that would be submitted to eu public the program consists of 4 parts in the program turkey expresses its commitments for the next four years the program requires 131 legal arrangements all of them are about adjustment
7656707 it is necessary to prepare an action plan to use water sources in the best way turkish government prepared an action plan comprising of 1543 projects
7656708 a step should be made to resolve problems not through military methods by through peaceful ways
7656709 sometimes in football you are faced with having to make difficult decisions involving good people today is one of those times
7656710 we believe this move will help us improve our secondary and ultimately win games
7656711 we have some young talent on our roster and we are looking forward to seeing them on the field
7656712 this event is a continuation in keras long history of presenting statewide broadcasts under the banner of the texas debates
7656713 our primary goal is to educate voters and provide the greatest number of citizens an opportunity to compare the candidates competing in this important race
7656714 it is important that texans get to hear what cornyns been up to in washington since no one seems to know and we look forward to five debates
7656715 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7656716 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7656717 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7656718 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7656719 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7656720 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7656721 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7656722 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7656723 whenever you win wars your troops come home and our troops will be coming home but it will be dictated by the conditions on the ground and the success or the lack of success

7656725 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
7656726 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
7656727 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
7656728 o que nos deixa temeroso ver que os candidatos partiram para promessas vazias imposs veis de serem realizadas como por exemplo colocar todo o atendimento m dico da cidade funcionando 24 horas tamb m disseram que s o bernardo n o aceitou nenhum projeto do governo federal isso uma grande mentira pois quando assumimos o governo tivemos tr s projetos habitacionais em parceria com o governo federal que foram cancelados e tivemos que tocar as obras com recursos pr prios
7656729 afinal um governo n o pode pensar no p de partido e sim no povo
7656730 eu achava que a fala dele era para justificar essa baixaria
7656731 essa baixaria n s n o podemos tolerar n o poss vel que o medo possa definir o processo democr tico

7656735 the pendulum has swung so far that normal consumer behavior has now been criminalized
7656736 i hope to see the very best of sporting competition
7656737 we must get used to governing while the public oppose and demonstrate
7656738 we must learn to govern despite small or medium scale disorder
7656739 we have not been allowed to teach our children the koran since the 1990s
7656740 they control our economy the real estate market road construction factories
7656741 they are simply imitating what they have seen on television from other arab countries
7656742 we live in the flat houses and they live in the tall buildings
7656743 if we become independent we will only get ourselves into trouble then it will be like iraq afghanistan or chechnya here
7656744 it also goes back to the meaning behind 33miles the idea that life can be short that christ lived only thirty three years on this earth so the question remains what will you and i do with our miles with the years we are given
7656745 the people of guatemala returned the charity i expected to administer with a relationship i didnt know existed
7656746 they showed me the gracious selfless love of a sovereign god who chose a specific place for me on heaven and earth and the equivalent place for every person in this world i think the size of my god grew exponentially in my heart and mind
7656747 are not all these who are speaking galileans 8 and how is it that we hear each of us in his own native language
7656748 ok thats all there is time to get to work
7656749 the spirit of god is here what are we waiting for
7656750 wait until the holy spirit comes then you will be my witnesses everywhere
7656751 right now in tibet buddhist monasteries have been sealed off tibetans are being denied of their basic human rights international medial remain barred from tibet
7656752 the olympics may be over tomorrow but the torture and killing in tibet is still happening
7656753 most of these young tibetans have actually gone back to tibet to visit their relatives and theyve seen how bad the situation is
7656754 before the olympics the chinese were known for chinese food but after the olympics they are known for being fake
7656755 during the games the chinese nationalism has sort of taken over but once the games are over theres going to be this anti climatic moment
7656756 the germans under the nazis had the games in 1936 and in 15 years they were gone and the russians under communism had them in 1980 and in 10 years they were gone and i kind of have this almost superstitious hope that maybe the same sort of phenomenon is going to happen in china
7656757 the city has calmed down ive been here for four months and ive only heard two rounds fired in the city the whole time
7656758 this will be based on conditions on the ground consequently neither london nor washington have endorsed plans and normal contingency military planning at the tactical level is under way
7656759 i can train an iraqi soldier as much as you like but unless the government sits down and says i am going to rule that city i am going to find a way to impose my will to impose the rule of law on that city come what may nothing is going to work
7656760 that was never for us to do and we couldnt make them want to do that
7656761 there is absolutely in this party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
7656762 its great to see that faith is being acknowledged finally
7656763 especially in my community when your pastor talks about something in church you go out and do it politically this could help
7656764 those born and to be born may all be at ease
7656765 those born and to be born may all be at ease
7656766 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
7656767 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
7656768 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
7656769 jackson browne said it perfectly in his acceptance speech for environmentalist of the year and gave me a new favorite saying a clean environment is the most basic human right
7656770 watermans weekend is a meaningful and powerful event for the whole surf industry because it is a time when we can support the organizations that are preserving the very resource our industry would not survive without the ocean as well as concentrating on our oceanic environment watermans weekend is a time to recognize our honorees who have made an impact in the sport of surfing and the environment
7656771 the qualifications for sima environmentalist of the year are extremely precise and tailored to environmental efforts as they impact the surf industry
7656772 as a true surfer jackson browne more than fulfills this prestigious role and is passionate about using his music to protect our waves from projects like heal the bay to preventing offshore drilling jackson has made a huge impact on our coastal lines something i know everyone in the surf industry is more than appreciative of we are proud to call jackson browne our sima environmentalist of the year
7656773 every dollar spent on the weekend every golfer on the links every bid on the auctions and every attendee at the ball made a difference for our surf breaks ocean and the environment
7656774 on behalf of sima thank you to all of those who supported the 19th annual watermans weekend
7656775 the fundamental take home message is that the government when it enters a contract with another party is held substantially to the same standard as everyone else
7656776 under these circumstances where both parties have participated in apparent good faith for the better part of 20 years the purpose of restitution is adequately served by having the government return the initial payments

7656782 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7656783 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7656784 were the generation we cant afford to wait the future started yesterday and were already late
7656785 dali homed in on cinemas seemingly contradictory ability to combine the real and the surreal the actual and the imaginary the objective and the imaginative the prosaic and the poetic
7656786 i think its great because im definitely around my cell phone more than i am my email
7656787 if theres a tornado coming well tell them theres a tornado if god forbid theres a shooting on campus the text will tell them to stay away from this area
7656788 we want people to see this message and know they need to read this
7656789 that way i know whats going on around me at all times
7656790 ive known rick for 20 years and weve waited for this opportunity for a double decade
7656791 ive not sat down with him pointedly to get down to business just yet but i feel very comfortable working within the framework that he envisions hes got a good feel on the pulse and im very interested in what he might have in mind
7656792 im such a big fan of those guys it makes total sense
7656793 and thats pretty down and dirty which is good for zz top
7656794 it was just me kickin back and having a good time
7656795 we did everything from a black church gospel ballad to updated versions of rollin and tumblin did some jimmy reed take off things just keeping that bluesy thread throughout i think that as long as we maintain that blues tradition the material takes on an identity thats easily digestible at least in terms of what our fans have asked for
7656796 if you liked lucent at 81 you gotta love it at 50
7656797 i didnt see chancellor white this much in the last four years as what ive seen chancellor gearhart in the last week
7656798 its expensive to run a university but im committed to ferret out any waste we can spend money strategically when it needs to be and try to reduce expenses on campus
7656799 no i dont think so did you call about anything else why am i saying no ok here are some reasons sorry no bye
7656800 fancy is he fucking kidding me dont worry baby i wont make us live with him
7656801 obviously the group concentrates much of its focus overseas but paul walsh is determined to get more value out of the brands at home
7656802 it looks like theyre on target to go back into production in the fall
7656803 i have children and the plant is really is in my backyard
7656804 the kids ride their bike down there suppose a kid was riding their bike and it blew up and the child got hurt i think they should rethink it before they reopen it

7656806 un delito es un universo rodeado de muchos factores no se puede juzgar a una persona sin conocer las circunstancias que lo llevaron a cometer determinado hecho
7656807 if the payment plan is introduced and if there are a substantial number of taxpayers that qualify and file for the plan then the county will be faced with an enormous bill
7656808 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7656809 we played some excellent football its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7656810 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7656811 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7656812 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7656813 its got all of the hallmarks of the way prime minister mr kevin rudd operates
7656814 you come up with some sort of media driven stunt to start a particular series of otherwise unpleasant political events
7656815 on more than one occasion been brought back in my mind to classes i took with dr bennett
7656816 on the threshold of the new world order a rebirth for the united nations
7656817 collective security today must encompass not only the security of nations
7656818 but also mankinds security in a global environment that has proven vulnerable to debilitating changes wrought by mans own endeavors
7656819 thus in setting an american agenda for a new world order we must begin with a profound alteration in traditional thought
7656820 administration if not absent has been little more than an onlooker
7656821 foster the conditions and institutions necessary for a free economy and a free body politic to thrive
7656822 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no more than 500 warheads per side
7656823 we should cut the gordian knot of difficult dismantlement by acting immediately to sequester all warheads to be eliminated
7656824 must be able to use force to stop rogue nations like north korea
7656825 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of allied territory against direct attack to make a great leap forward and adopt peace keeping outside nato territory as a formal alliance mission
7656826 the president has opposed every congressional effort to impose serious sanctions or even link trade to more reasonable chinese policies on human rights and the sale of dangerously destabilizing arms
7656827 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow
7656828 for the united states it should become a paramount priority to promote american environmental technologies and services around the world
7656829 we do not despite what the president or anyone else may say have to choose between jobs and the environment
7656830 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7656831 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7656832 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7656833 it is really nice to come home to a nice reception and theres nothing better than coming home
7656834 im going to have a really nice long break and decide what i want to do just do all the things that i havent been able to do and then decide when i want to get back in the pool
7656835 ive had a really hard run but ive had a fantastic time in beijing and i have a beautiful piece of silver hanging around my neck and now that weve finally touched down in sydney its such a great feeling
7656836 swimmers get up really early every day so itll be really nice to stay in bed as long as i want
7656837 everyone was taking photos of each other on the flight and it was really good fun
7656838 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market
7656839 technicals have a consolidative look and there is no fresh fundamental news of any consequence to move the markets
7656840 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7656841 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence
7656842 dont let my face be the last thing you see heaven might hold it against you
7656843 do you really know enough about obama to vote for him
7656844 vote for our guy or your whole world might colapse
7656845 how would i go about answering that from the information desk
7656846 if hes killed on oct 14 we will kill a changed man
7656847 obviously felt that the mitigation we presented did not outweigh the aggravating factors in the case
7656848 this just does not sound like someone taking responsibility for the major part he played in killing these young women
7656849 in the 22 years since the defendant committed these brutal acts he has never demonstrated one second of genuine remorse for murdering these two young women
7656850 nos hemos esforzado en hacer frente a la desinformaci n
7656851 in tanti hanno pensato che quelle immagini fossero riprese dal vivo
7656852 joseph had complications from the time of his birth and blood donors played a significant part of josephs short life
7656853 i am sure that his father shaun would encourage people to donate blood as he knows the importance first hand
7656854 not only will donors be given the opportunity to save lives but they will also be entered into a drawing for several wonderful items and enjoy entertainment by a comedian and a country western performer
7656855 we want in five years time to be the best general contractor not only on the west coast but in the state of florida
7656856 the more we examined the deal the more we felt comfortable
7656857 kraft gains the foundation experience and resources available through manhattans extensive portfolio and manhattan gains the excellent team strength and reputation of krafts 40 years in florida
7656858 their monitoring facility is award winning the staff is extremely talented and their customer service truly set them apart from anyone else we were considering
7656859 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
7656860 every minute i breathe is a minute of my life im investing
7656861 straight in the eye and i want to tell him what a cheap lying no good rotten four flushing low life snake licking dirt eating inbred overstuffed ignorant blood sucking dog kissing brainless dickless hopeless heartless fat ass bug eyed stiff legged spotty lipped worm headed sack of monkey he is hallelujah holy amp wheres the tylenol
7656862 the experience they have is one thing thats a team thats going to come in very confident very aggressive defensively ive said it before they think this may be their best team since urbans meyer team went to the bcs
7656863 theyve got a very athletic quarterback that runs the spread which weve had problems against in the past theyve got some explosive players theyve got some of the fastest corners we will play against theyre pretty solid and theyve got a great punter kicker in louis sakoda
7656864 there are really no weak spots and its a veteran team so its not like were opening up against somebody that we can mess around and play awful and win weve got to play well to win this one
7656865 hes an explosive guy then theyve got the other big tailback matt asiata those guys can play for anybody mack had a great year last year hes a perfect spread back in that he can catch the ball hes got quick hips
7656866 hes kind of like shaun king hes a little faster than shaun i think shaun wouldnt tell you that but hes very very competitive
7656867 resolves one of several bureaucratic hurdles facing centers in the wake of a march 2007 state court of appeals ruling in capen v shewry in that case a physician challenged the department of public healths contention that it had oversight over his surgery clinic
7656868 what i do find annoying is that novell is continuing to feed microsofts fud machine about linux
7656869 microsoft is about to embark on a new advertising campaign designed to make people love it again and not merely endure it
7656870 remember when jason matasow asked how can microsoft not be evil the question remains unanswered
7656871 microsofts hiring of jerry seinfeld as a windows vista pitchman had the linux community in stitches last week
7656872 despite an often tenuous relationship with the linux community regarding the driver quality for its graphics products the amd owned ati linux patent pool web site to help inventors file defensive pub
7656873 a tech vendor backed company that buys up patents in an effort to protect the linux community from intellectual property litigation doing the good thing
7656874 my reasons for bringing this up are purely to show just how fragmented the wasp really is
7656875 here are some useful commands that you can use to find almost every information that you want to know about your cli magic for geek cred try these one liners
7656876 a one liner is a set of commands normally joined through a pipe when joined by a pipe the command on the left passes its output newsflash grannies need linux
7656877 i completely realize im a geek ive been using linux far longer than its been the cool thing to do
7656878 even though the data is apparently a bit screwy i was still really proud to see utah emerge as the top state for
7656879 we need some of that in fact a lot of that
7656880 what we see depends mainly on what we look for
7656881 a good sense of humor is essential to deal with the worlds reality
7656882 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
7656883 committee a group of people who individually can do nothing but as a group decide that nothing can be done
7656884 im reaching farther than i ever have before leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore i may be some sort of crazy we may be some sort of crazy
7656885 we are not suggesting one way or the other as to what the officers were truly doing in this case we are just saying it was error for the district court not to examine whether there was a factual basis for the police to believe they had probable cause to get the search warrant
7656886 i dont think anybody is thinking about a sweep were playing better now than when they came in the last time our bullpen is set up differently now
7656887 now get back into that classroom and live up to the promise of teaching
7656888 multiple intelligences multiple methods multiple methods of accountability in this case grades
7656889 but what if my homework assignments which are primarily reading assignments are not practice but preparation
7656890 we recognize the pain suffered by mr healys family over his tragic passing
7656891 we hope the settlement brings them some measure of closure
7656892 chase you with pinching fingers out of the park on saint pattys day for not wearing green
7656893 you know the old rabbit in the boots trick right right
7656894 we are continuing to navigate through the modern world with a stone age mind
7656895 who needs a favor who is in a position to offer one who is trustworthy who is a liar who is available sexually who is under the protection of a jealous partner who is likely to abandon a family who poses a threat to us
7656896 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7656897 we recognize the pain suffered by mr healys family over his tragic passing
7656898 we hope the settlement brings them some measure of closure
7656899 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7656900 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7656901 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7656902 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7656903 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7656904 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7656905 we wanted a show where the music was relevant to the culture at large and not just within the confines of the musical theater
7656906 my immediate thought was spring awakening it was 1999 everyone was having millennial thoughts and i thought a great way to look forward would be by looking back this story just struck my heart
7656907 a straight shot of eroticism has steamed open under the innocuous name of spring awakening and broadway may never be the same
7656908 he he dared to tell the truth at a time when that kind of truth telling just wasnt done were in a similar place in our society now where there are a lot of heads buried in the sand
7656909 the bitch of living the musicals creators pay tribute to the spirit of the original
7656910 wedekind was about adolescent angst the way adolescents now deal with their angst is they listen to indie rock and emo so what better way of channeling the angst of 1891 german kids than to send them into this kind of alternate reality where they become rock stars in their bedrooms
7656911 we were trying to make sure that what we did had integrity
7656912 and was progressive and was true to the spirit of frank wedekind but was yes trying to bring a new audience to the theater
7656913 i love the fact that the brackets of musical theater are being expanded
7656914 and should more accurately be called hormonal awakening i am of the older generation its not for me
7656915 the experience of becoming an adult and moving out of childhood transcends time and place
7656916 this is when you start to define yourself and the world starts to define you the changes you are experiencing physically emotionally socially and in every other way are so extreme that inevitably things are triggered you start to become the person you are
7656917 ke kazzo volete da tom e bill kaulitz siete forse invidiosi dei tokio hotel cercate rogna secondo me siete gelosi della loro bellezza e bravura infinita se vi stanno sul kazzo annatevene a butt da 1 ponte e nn rompeteci i coglioni brutti rognosi by th girls p s siete solo dei mongoflettici mongoloidi mongospastici mongoli mongappati struppi ma andatevene a fare in culo rispondete in molti ahahahahahahahahaha naturalmente se avate coraggio siete bacucchi scaduti

7656919 oltre al fatto che la musica house deriva molto probabilmente dal connubio fra un trapano impazzito e un sub che affoga il truzzo possiede una carenza intellettiva del concetto di ego che gli impedisce totalmente di vivere pensare o agire autonomamente
7656920 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
7656921 im getting married in three hours and we have no cake
7656922 you know that i have said over and over that no occasion no matter how small is complete without cake
7656923 i know grand mother but you know what kind of pressure weddings can be

7656925 you love me youve got all this guests at the church and you arent even dressed i should have listened to my grandmother bea she said over and over that youre a stunk i guess she never got over that video of you and the hookers from your bachelor party
7656926 i dont need no stinkin cake i just want to get married to my true love even if he cant tell left from right it doesnt matter to me if he fell in love with a hooter girl it was just a bachelor party fling

7656928 i had been talking about it in the congressional lunchroom and i had said biden
7656929 but i also said no one knew for sure because this obama campaign is so disciplined
7656930 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7656931 by adding joe biden to the ticket they are trying to fortify him in areas he is weak
7656932 i happen to like joe biden but even joe biden says obama is not ready to lead
7656933 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls

7656935 it is gratifying to be able to attract students who not only are known for their acumen in the classroom but also their vibrant christian testimonies
7656936 we have had the privilege of meeting some outstanding men and women recruiting them to taylor watching them flourish and seeing them make an impact in the world
7656937 taylors tradition of global engagement is not a recent phenomenon
7656938 from taylors earliest days our students faculty staff and alumni have served and studied in many different overseas settings
7656939 taylor university is recognized as being a highly selective academic institution where students with vibrant spiritual lives live primarily on campus or in university approved housing
7656940 it is who we are we are pleased given current economic realities that our enrollment continues to be high evidencing a demand for a taylor educational experience
7656941 we are excited to welcome an extraordinary freshman class along with new and distinguished faculty members as we begin this our 163rd year we are all rededicating ourselves to the purposes of god for his kingdom and the work he is doing at taylor university
7656942 we do not have plans at the moment to publish the penguin great ideas series in the usa
7656943 if youre doing something nice for someone else but not for me then youre being unfair and mean to me and i dont like you
7656944 why do people blame pilate for jesus death when pilate said he was innocent
7656945 my old friend will you buy from me today i see you leave you go home to your wife girlfriend i have lovely cameos for your lovely ladies

7656950 und du siehst die beiden m nner wieder die du ein vierteljahr vorher auf der erde verabschiedet hast
7656951 nicht nur dass wenige tage vor dem start eigenartige senffarbene wolken aufgetaucht waren und kurz nach dem berflug des bermudadreiecks sonderbare blaue blitze aufleuchteten nein nicht genug damit es boten sich uns auch noch einzigartige bedingungen f r die polarlichtbeobachtung die geheimnisvoll anmutenden bewegungen dieser grauen w nde die sich pl tzlich zu riesigen s ulen b gen und schleiern formten und sogleich wieder zusammenfielen erzeugten in mir den eindruck berdimensionalen m rchenspielen beizuwohnen
7656952 zum ersten mal wird im weltall deutsch gesprochen wenn auch mit s chsischem akzent was die sache gleich wieder etwas ins komische zieht der erste richtige deutsche soll schlie lich erst 1980 mit einem amerikanischen spacelab raumschiff in den weltraum fliegen
7656953 ich glaube er ist aus diesem ort hier und war der erste astronaut
7656954 well term leases cover a significant portion of the state probably about 40 per cent from memory its not an insignificant component
7656955 its a process thats been put in place to try and deal with the large number of renewals that are coming up to balance environmental interests along with the long term requirements for land holders for certainty of tenure
7656956 the type of leases we have across the state are extremely diverse land systems so coming up with a system that accounts for that accounts for the vagaries of drought and other items
7656957 if the world wildlife fund is supporting aquaculture as a viable way of producing quality fresh seafood then i dont think anybody has got anything to worry about
7656958 in tasmania and south australia they actually produce more seafood from aquaculture than queensland does from its fisheries
7656959 im going to lose a lot of country that i fish ive got a small boat and i do shallow water fishing for golden trevally queen fish species like that over the flats and theyre going to be taking these areas
7656960 theyve already taken a big slice of my area from the marine park with green zones now theyre going to take more and its going to really hurt my business
7656961 the window of vulnerability that wasnt soviet military buildup in the 1970s
7656962 nuclear exchange does washington really have or want nuclear primacy
7656963 he just didnt stop it was like being stalked the thought of what he might do kept me awake at night
7656964 ten things i think i think about marriage and marriage counseling
7656965 improving your tennis game by becoming less concerned about your tennis technique
7656966 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7656967 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7656968 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7656969 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7656970 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7656971 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7656972 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7656973 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7656974 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7656975 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7656976 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7656977 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7656978 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7656979 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7656980 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7656981 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7656982 this was a historic year and a challenging primary season
7656983 but i think all democrats know that issues our country is facing must be solved by democrats
7656984 there is work to be done absolutely but were capable of getting over it its going to be abundantly clear on the floor that sen clinton expects her delegates to vote for barack obama
7656985 small small number of people that the media pay lots of attention to
7656986 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that ad
7656987 sometimes hurt feelings happen but there is not time for us now to do anything other than be united
7656988 the bottom line is this race is about mccain vs obama
7656989 obama is the nominee and once sen clinton speaks tomorrow were all going to come out 100 percent for him
7656990 he really appeals to me as a clinton supporter and he appeals to the same working class democratic voters that sen clinton does
7656991 jack figured that since we were driving south we didnt need a heater
7656992 i dislike homosexual sex but affected lust as compensation for all you have given me
7656993 two keen minds that they are they took to each other at the drop of hat the holy con man with shining mind and the sorrowful poetic con man with dark mind
7656994 a couple of crooked narcotics guys set him up he could of gotten off maybe if he fought it after all there was no evidence cassady smoked the joint with the undercover officers
7656995 was caught up in the mystical madness of the moment
7656996 beat means beatific short for beatific vision you know the higher vision you can get a shortcut is marijuana
7656997 trouble with me is that i am living on the four lower glands and havent opened up the higher three ones the pituitary and endorphin glands are centers of the force
7656998 the thing is to get the kundalini fire to come up the spine into the pineal
7656999 art is good when it springs from necessity this kind of origin is the guarantee of value there is no other
7657000 provide a portrait of characters who took to the road not to find life but to leave it behind
7657001 flight of the dreamer from drab duties of home and town a fundamental narrative pattern in american culture
7657002 a failure of artistic realization treacherous tedious neither exciting illuminating or enduring
7657003 my work comprises one vast book like prousts except that my remembrances are written on the run instead of afterward in a sick bed
7657004 he wrote his books not so much to tell the truth as to make truth
7657005 they reversed our psyches and put words into our mouths and actions which were the antithesis of what we were and aspired to be it was a hideous mockery of our ideals and our struggle to rise above the mediocre mindless herd instincts
7657006 they were artists without any agenda the writers were not attempting to change the world but rather were trying to live authentically
7657007 we found out with any form of energy theres ever been the longer we try to work at things the better we get at it
7657008 i thought i was never going to see my wife and daughter again
7657009 its a small price to pay i know others out there are paying with their arms legs and sometimes their lives
7657010 okay its time to vote utahn republicans which of these candidates do you prefer to become your next president
7657011 well 89 of us reckon that we prefer that conservative talkin lds guy with the nice hair
7657012 according to us based on these primary election results utahs republican national delegation will be bound to cast 100 of their votes for romney on their first national convention ballot in september
7657013 meh my presidential campaign is hopeless with mccains friend huckabee drawing votes away from me so im suspending it and becoming mccains biggest cheerleader instead buttsmooch i now want all of my national delegates to vote for mccain to the extent that the law rules will allow now what is thy bidding my master
7657014 muhahahahahahaha now more than 51 of all national delegates will be voting for me next i want to assimilate the other 49 as well so that i can enjoy a big everyone loves mccain fest in september hey utah gimme yours
7657015 sorry mccain but we dont allow bound to romney as the voters decided and thats final
7657016 whoa not so fast you darn rules no worries john we wont let those pesky rules stop us from getting you whatever it is you want hey state delegates we need 2 3 of you to vote to suspend these annoying party rules so that our national delegates can be free to vote for mccain instead
7657017 wait you want us to throw out our rulebook and nullify our primary just to please that awful mccain heck no
7657018 forget about it guys as long as its up to us utahs national delegates must cast their first set of ballots for whichever candidate received the most votes in utahs primary election and that was romney by a landslide sorry
7657019 hey thats it well just redefine what the meaning of the word is is er candidate lets see hmmm lets say that the candidate who received the most votes in our primary election does not apply to candidates who suspend their campaigns once the primary election is over so although romney was initially the candidate who received the most votes with 89 since he suspended his campaign he no longer counts and so mccain has now became the candidate who received the most votes with only 5 once we pervert these rules those darn rule respecting utahns can follow them and still give us what we want why didnt we think of this devious scheme sooner
7657020 hey thats not what those who wrote us meant to
7657021 shut up youll mean what we say you mean now central committee we need you to vote to approve our new screwy interpretation that weve invented so that it will serve as a new standing rule for our party
7657022 okay 85 of us say hey whatever you want boss
7657023 hurrah we won eat that voters and delegates as you can see your votes only count when we like the outcome we not your silly rules are the supreme power in this party bwahahaha

7657196 santa barbara co supervisors expected to back offshore oil drilling
7657197 proponents of the measure argue that the united states cannot turn away from a homegrown energy source at a time when the country is dangerously dependent on foreign oil and technology has made offshore drilling safer than ever
7657198 a year ago supervisor brooks firestone voted with the majority of the board in support of a federal moratorium on such drilling he changed his mind he said because technology has preempted that last argument
7657199 allow expanded oil exploration and extraction in the santa barbara county region
7657200 we didnt need the revenues property values were such that we were paying our own bills we didnt need the jobs employment was very sound the threat to the tourist industry if we were going to have sticky beaches that would be a disaster

7657222 foreign stocks are an unnecessary luxury for most u s investors with the growth of globalization financial markets throughout the world have become increasingly correlated particularly in times of market adversity the higher correlations of foreign markets with the u s market in recent years and the convergence in national economic growth rates reduce the diversification effect of foreign equity investment any remaining cross border diversification effect is probably largely due to currency fluctuations unless your net worth exceeds say 5 million it usually makes sense to ignore foreign securities markets
7657223 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7657224 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample

7657472 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7657473 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7657474 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7657516 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7657517 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7657518 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7657519 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7657520 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7657521 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7657522 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7657523 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7657524 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7657525 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7657526 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7657527 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7657528 our non contact work has a little contact we thudded too hard

7657531 bens a great competitor i know hes going to be nervous the kids in practice have had great experience under fire and i thought saturday he stepped up and kicked four field goals
7657532 weve done that on purpose we tried to give all those kids as much opportunity to compete as a starter
7657533 i made sure they all had the same amount of reps
7657534 these three got the overwhelming majority of their votes from staff in their own parties

7657544 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7657545 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7657546 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7657547 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7657548 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7657559 life is short it is shorter when you are 80 i think you shouldnt be lonely
7657560 wow i guess he needs to do what is best for him and he shouldnt be lonely
7657561 sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer
7657562 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7657563 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7657564 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7657565 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7657566 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7657567 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport

7657573 he didnt say anything i asked did you call me an uncle tom he never said anything at that point i proceeded to call him a few things then i walked away
7657574 theres this feeling out here that weve somehow betrayed the race
7657575 the attitude from obama supporters is that theyre going to beat you into submission and make you admit you were wrong for supporting hillary
7657576 i used the same litmus test and this time it happened to be hillary clinton i feel confidant and have no shame whatsoever its not like she was an insignificant candidate
7657577 ontela is lucky to get an executive of damians experience and caliber
7657578 after a six month search led by anderson search partners damian was the clear choice for the role we couldnt be happier
7657579 i approached the ontela team after i heard about their early customer successes
7657580 once i saw the product i was hooked its just that easy to get photos off the phone take a picture and they appear like magic on the computer then when i met the engineering team it sealed the deal the technical talent here is absolutely first rate and growing fast helping the team develop is going to be really fun

7657623 its the natural evolution for the marketing of our directional audio arrays if you get right down to it we have been producing directional audio for flat panel displays like those used in digital signage since dakota audios inception over ten years ago
7657624 their vocalizing a need for a high quality directional audio solution that according to them didnt exist in the digital signage market was a big factor in our decision so far the response has been overwhelming and manufacturing is struggling to keep up with demand

7657633 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7657634 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7657635 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7657636 but they are so sweat not like the police from my country
7657637 i like to have some fun talk junk then beat them down it hurts worse
7657638 my parents were always that way getting me around different people and different children and i guess i just kind of adapted to that
7657639 i try to get all my anger out on the field and off the field i try to be a leader for the young kids and the people in our community
7657640 i thought it would be a lot harder but i feel like ive made a nice transition
7657641 i feel like ive been holding my own ive just been trying to be the best i can be every day physically its hard youre hitting every day but i love it
7657642 im participating in practice doing everything normally were just taking a more cautious approach to it right now but everything is feeling really well
7657643 im just working on my technique and fundamentals and im just trying to get better every day so i can move up the depth chart
7657644 hes a great role model and great friend hes always helped me if i ever have questions hes always there its just great to look up to him because hes always doing the right things i really respect him as a player and person
7657645 generally we take one shot of this building one shot of that building or one shot of the front of a room and one shot of the back of a room but here if you take photos of about 40 or 50 overlap to each other which is very simple to do in the digital camera era and it doesnt what matter what kind of camera even camera phone if you put them into the synth er itll actually calculate what it thinks the environment looks like by looking for similarities between the textures and the object so even if the lighting conditions are different even if they were taken at a different time of day different time of year different angles photosynth can kind of match up the textures and it creates this 3d point cloud which you can see floating in the background behind those pictures its a very sparse 3d model of the area then we use that 3d model as a canvas on which to display the photo
7657646 photosynth relies 100 on the ability of the software to extrapolate a 3d model from the 2d
7657647 theres actually two major technical advances in photosynth that together are kind of a one plus one equals five scenario number one is the
7657648 the other half of that two part achievement is the zooming technology if you notice we can load lots of very large very detailed pictures very fast as a matter of fact you can even fill your screen with a photosynth theres a small button in the bottom right of the viewer thatll maximize it to the full browser window area and youll see we can even fill in pictures with detail and you can zoom in on any image and get all the details in there so whether youre talking about 5 10 megapixel images or if youre talking about a synth like you can search for the national archives and youll find a synth where we have a bunch of 10 mp images from a digital camera mixed with 50 mp scans of the constitution and it was able to match them up and situate them in the scene automatically even though those were taken with a different machine in a different location the constitutions still the constitution

7657650 america refuses to accept defeat in the olympic medal count
7657651 they agreed to change the governor of the banadir region and the mayor of mogadishu
7657652 the president he accepted now i do not have exactly what was agreed but that is the most important
7657653 yusuf is banking on that they are not going to drop recognition of the tfg transitional federal government which is the only threat that really matters to him
7657654 and second of all he believes he can buy off parliament there is a lot of disaffection with nur adde among the old mp warlord interests and so he thinks he can swing parliament behind him
7657655 dont you have the right to protest dont you have the right to remain silent
7657656 cops dont have any right to demand identification from people unless they have reason to believe a crime has been committed and then you are obligated to give your name
7657657 the cops cant just walk up to any old person on the street and demand id and then arrest them if they say no
7657658 why didnt they see what they put behind the toilets before they asked them for their names
7657659 those protesters may end up in federal court on a civil rights violation case and id be happy to represent them
7657660 depends on a reasonable suspicion of committing a crime not that youre dressed in a mask and attending a demonstration they better have something on the criminal side or it is a wrongful violation of your constitutional right to protest
7657661 but what that means to any reasonable person is that im not going to give you my name
7657662 but they cant just stop you for running breathlessly down the street
7657663 there has to be a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct
7657664 to hide something in a public place is not a normal behavior
7657665 youve got this tension in a sitaution like this between their duty to protect the public from dangerous conditions and our constitutional right to protest
7657666 what is the conduct that is criminal they cant suspect everything that is not something they would do if theyre just targeting protesters and picking them up first amendment rights to protest are being violated
7657667 i think it is all going to send a clear message to the american people that democrats are ready to govern and that this election presents a clear choice between four more years of the failed policies that weve seen from george bush and serious effort to help ordinary families that are desperate for relief
7657668 the first day i started painting it i had a man come into my driveway with a little girl going why are you doing this
7657669 the next morning was dog poop on my fence the third morning there was a dead rabbit on my lawn and a dead rat in my pool
7657670 you are hurting these families and the children in them by making their homes less desirable
7657671 if i was cruising around this neighborhood and saw that i wouldnt buy a house at least anywhere near it
7657672 you are doing phd in xxx field why are you doing your degree in that xxx field it is lesser value than phd in engineering
7657673 i want to register my phd in engineering no class
7657674 if you are studying this kind of degree then you are
7657675 we dont want to lose hold of this wealth that is 6 000 metres deep
7657676 it is the wealth of the country it is the wealth of 190 million brazilians and we have to use this wealth to help the poor of the country
7657677 to resolve definitively the problem of education in this country to resolve the problems of millions of poor that are here and not leave it in the hands of half a dozen companies that think the petrol belongs to them
7657678 i think the government has two views about creating a new company
7657679 one of these is to have large control of the oil production and this a nationalist view to keep control of the oil production the other concern is about getting most of the profit from the oil
7657680 and this is before tupi for sure tupi and the pre salt area will increase those numbers mostly after 2013 but for sure we are going to get a bigger number than that
7657681 i think brazil will still carry on its programme of ethanol because ethanol is still cheaper than gasoline and so i dont think there is a contradiction
7657682 brazil will probably become a large exporter of oil products and keep developing bio fuels and bio energy because it is a very large resource in the country
7657683 brazil does not think that ethanol is a solution for the whole world in energy terms it only plays a small part
7657684 it is impossible to supply all the fuel used in the world from bio energy but it can play a very important role and is very important for developing countries that need new sources of revenue
7657685 i think brazil should take care not to have oil as the only financial resource and to also use this money to develop other industries
7657686 i determined not to know anything amongst you except jesus christ and him crucified
7657687 i never stopped preaching about jesus and his crucifixion i found that once these people were gripped by the meaning of christs sacrifice i did not have to give them many instructions about changing their behaviour

7657712 everybody in 1908 thought denver was kind of a cow town
7657713 denver wanted to give an impression that it was sophisticated and had culture i think theres still something of an inferiority complex here that is totally undeserved

7657725 its the natural evolution for the marketing of our directional audio arrays if you get right down to it we have been producing directional audio for flat panel displays like those used in digital signage since dakota audios inception over ten years ago
7657726 their vocalizing a need for a high quality directional audio solution that according to them didnt exist in the digital signage market was a big factor in our decision so far the response has been overwhelming and manufacturing is struggling to keep up with demand
7657727 i think it is all going to send a clear message to the american people that democrats are ready to govern and that this election presents a clear choice between four more years of the failed policies that weve seen from george bush and serious effort to help ordinary families that are desperate for relief

7657752 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7657753 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7657754 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7657755 man i dont drop character until im finished with the dvd commentary
7657756 we have to find a way of managing our budget so that were less vulnerable
7657757 i could not be more proud of the men and women of this agency who made this possible
7657758 the idea is if i drove through california or louisiana or florida i should expect the same level of quality service and the same ethical standards
7657759 lost its focus at least in part because of the influence of alcohol
7657760 b arbecue arose less from native cooking practices than from a european gaze that wanted to associate those practices with preexisting ideas of savagery and innocence
7657761 a chance to relax and spend an hour or ten in flight from the pressures of civilized life
7657762 weve taken steps to fortify our shipping system with the acquisition of additional equipment and worked with our vendors to verify were in good shape elsewhere
7657763 hindley is the symbol of evil not a beacon of everything thats good about britain
7657764 its an example of how theres no censorship in the uk
7657765 by literally branding her face with her victims touch the painter was making a classic example of a pittura infamante an image intended to defame for the indignant viewers however the myra summoned her presence and in continuing to make her visible to all seemed to celebrate her crimes
7657766 though i believe brady is wicked beyond belief without hope of redemption
7657767 i cannot feel that the same is necessarily true of hindley once she is removed from his influence
7657768 how do i make my game more fun for more gamers
7657769 weapon a sounds dumb but weapons b c and d sounds great
7657770 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7657771 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7657772 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7657773 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7657774 no one works for someone we all just work together
7657775 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7657776 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7657777 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7657778 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7657779 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7657780 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7657781 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7657782 i dont know why it doesnt hurt but im gonna keep on running
7657783 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7657784 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7657785 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7657786 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7657787 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7657788 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7657789 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7657790 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7657791 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7657792 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7657793 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7657794 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7657795 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7657796 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7657797 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7657798 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7657799 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7657800 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7657801 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7657802 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7657803 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7657804 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7657805 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7657806 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7657807 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7657808 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7657809 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7657810 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7657811 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7657812 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7657813 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7657814 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7657815 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7657816 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7657817 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7657818 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7657819 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7657820 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7657821 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7657822 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7657823 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7657824 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7657825 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7657826 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7657827 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7657828 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7657829 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7657830 this is a planning took where all things are going
7657831 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7657832 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7657833 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7657834 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7657835 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7657836 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7657837 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7657838 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7657839 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7657840 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7657841 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7657842 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7657843 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7657844 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7657845 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7657846 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7657847 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7657848 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7657849 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7657850 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7657851 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7657852 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7657853 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7657854 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7657855 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7657856 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7657857 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7657858 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7657859 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7657860 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7657861 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7657862 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7657863 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7657864 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7657865 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7657866 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7657867 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7657868 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7657869 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7657870 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7657871 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7657872 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7657873 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7657874 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7657875 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7657876 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7657877 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7657878 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7657879 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7657880 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7657881 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7657882 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7657883 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7657884 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7657885 how important is it for kim to agree with your opinions
7657886 are you intimidated by kims presence in debrief do you find yourself holding back when it is your turn to speak
7657887 how do you feel to have kim lead the debriefs
7657888 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7657889 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7657890 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7657891 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7657892 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7657893 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7657894 no matter how imperfect things are if youve got a free press everything is correctable without it everything is concealable
7657895 since treatment for congenital heart disease has improved so has the survival rate thus more children are entering adulthood and facing new health challenges
7657896 sometimes as they grow they develop adult health problems that are often beyond the comfort level of their pediatric specialists these patients need health professionals who can help them deal with adult issues as well as their heart problems
7657897 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7657898 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7657899 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7657900 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7657901 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7657902 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7657903 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7657904 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7657905 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7657906 we have to find a way of managing our budget so that were less vulnerable
7657907 abort er ikke kvinnesak men menneskesak det er typisk norsk skulle ha 50 prosent av begge kj nn i alt det skal liksom v re likestilling men menn har ingenting de skulle sagt hvis kvinnen nsker drepe barnet og det kaller de likestilling
7657908 venninnen min ble voldtatt og valgte ta abort kaller du henne en morder hvis abort blir forbudt skal kvinner ta abort hjemme da dere kan ikke tvinge kvinner til b re frem u nskede barn
7657909 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7657910 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7657911 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7657912 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7657913 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7657914 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7657915 the california registry brings a great depth of experience with ghg emissions tracking and reporting
7657916 ansi is pleased to count the california climate action registry among our partners in this initiative
7657917 we are proud to partner with ansi in support of the reduction of ghg emissions
7657918 this program marks a significant step forward in ensuring the credibility and consistency in emissions reporting and reduction projects across industry sectors and geographical borders
7657919 when he shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and that shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will fall in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun
7657920 visual computing is an amazing field that brings together the leading edge of technology science and art its power has simultaneously made it a tool for creation a medium for artistic expression and a platform for entertainment exploration and communications
7657921 visual computing is transforming industries all over the world from games movies and automobiles to advertising and medicine yet this is just the beginning of the visual computing era we are excited to launch this one of a kind event to celebrate the achievements of our industry and to create an environment where we can collaborate to create the future of visual computing
7657922 this is like hosting the olympics of video games so were very excited
7657923 as the capital of silicon valley san jose is the perfect backdrop for this global event
7657924 weve got to crack down on employers who are taking advantage of undocumented workers
7657925 when you read about a meatpacking plant hiring 13 year olds 14 year olds that is some of the most dangerous difficult work there is they have kids in there wielding buzz saws and cleavers its ridiculous and the only reason theyre hiring these folks is because they want to avoid paying people decent wages and providing them decent benefits
7657926 good afternoon i appreciate you all being here the monday before our first game against illinois were certainly all excited about the game ill update injuries like i usually do
7657927 with our football team right now our goal is just to prepare and thats what we do with our first games every year
7657928 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7657929 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7657930 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7657931 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7657932 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road

7657938 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7657939 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7657940 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7657941 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

7658180 curfew study hall and doing the right things in the classroom
7658181 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
7658182 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
7658183 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
7658184 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
7658185 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
7658186 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
7658187 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
7658188 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
7658189 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
7658190 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
7658191 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
7658192 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
7658193 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
7658194 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
7658195 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range
7658196 things change pretty quickly coach has done a good job preparing us for it all
7658197 you can kick your leg out just like a pitcher throwing too many pitches you almost have to kind of be on a kick count
7658198 jake is a great long snapper and hes really going to do well with field goals im completely confident with him for all of us to get our timing down
7658199 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7658200 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7658219 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss
7658220 it is clear that the nsidc graph is correct and that 2008 arctic ice is barely 10 above last year just as nsidc had stated
7658221 if you repeat something long enough it eventually becomes true

7658262 believe s god is moving to create new monastic communities to help the church in america remember resurrection
7658263 some idealists dreams of peace and harmony in our time
7658264 new monasticism is a sign that god is still living and active moving on the margins of the church to show us what faithfulness means in our time
7658265 the monastic impulse drove desert abbas fathers and ammas mothers out into the abandoned places to learn gods power by fighting the devil face to face
7658266 christian communities sheltered people from the economic fallout and offered the hope of a different kingdom
7658267 ia tidak ada mana mana rujukan hanya berdasarkan pendapat peribadi dan ini salah besar bercakap hal hukum berasaskan fikiran sendiri adalah kesalahan yang besar dalam islam
7658268 hukum ini bersumpah adalah hukum allah yang terdapat dalam al quran dan as sunah dan dihurai serta ditafsir dalam pelbagai kitab
7658269 malah dalam satu hadis ada diingatkan sesiapa yang memberi fatwa dalam hal hukum tanpa merujuk kepada sumber ilmu yang muktabar sedialah tempat untuk mereka dalam neraka kerana apa yang dicakapkan akan menjadi panduan masyarakat
7658270 sebab itu apabila saya bercakap mesti ada kitab di depan saya tulisan saya ada rujukan saya tak berani nak bercakap hatta melalui ingatan sahaja

7658276 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7658277 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7658278 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7658279 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia

7658283 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7658284 i forgot how tough it is to run routes when youre a little bit winded in the two minute drill even though i didnt go but a few plays its just good to get out there and run around again im happy i can go out there and run without any pain im basically trying to get into the best playing shape that i can and get my cardio up i hope i feel pretty good tomorrow

7658295 uniting jews from around the world through the bond of torah is one of the greatest things that we as a nation could do in tribute to our fallen mias
7658296 ehud goldwasser and eldad regev died while fighting to defend the land of israel and it is important that we never forget how and why they were killed our hope is that the learning of torah in their honor will be a blessing for their memories and an inspiration for their families and for jews around the globe

7658299 a ten year program for the achievement of this end has been prepared and one of its products is the launching of the final satellite launcher
7658300 for the peaceful use of space iran has cooperated with russia and italy and this will be continued in the future

7658306 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time yet
7658307 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging upon us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7658308 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7658309 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear for the sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7658310 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7658311 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7658312 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7658313 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise

7658404 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7658405 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7658406 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7658432 we talked as a family before joe even knew about it and we went to joe two years ago and said we think you are the only one that can pull together the red states and the blue states and build consensus on issues that are important we think you should run and he did
7658433 its a little challenging in that im always changing hats im grading papers in the car between campaign stops its a little hard to transition some of the time but life is never dull
7658434 he asked if i couldnt cancel the other date because he was only in town for one night
7658435 so i did i canceled the other date because i thought it might be interesting to go out and see what he was like
7658436 we hadnt told anybody but our family and closest friends the ceremony itself was family only but that counted nearly forty beau and hunter stood with us at the altar we had a big reception lunch at the sign of the dove since all four of us were getting married that we should include the boys on the honeymoon we got two nice hotel rooms and let the boys pick theirs that night we went to see annie on broadway
7658437 most people dont know that joe has a romantic side
7658438 she also has a doctorate degree which is a problem
7658439 i wanted my own money my own identity my own career
7658440 having been a teacher for many years i would have to say that education would be my number one priority
7658441 i think i am like the average american im in a community college classroom i have students who are working and going to school and have children i think im dealing with real life every single day i take that home to joe and say look these students cant afford college they are having these problems we have to change this we have to change that i think what i do in my life experiences has a positive impact on joe and hopefully it expands to have a positive influence on other people
7658442 education is not just about reading writing and arithmetic its about teaching our children how to keep themselves healthy so my focus would include teaching about health issues like obesity the dangers of smoking and educating young girls about breast cancer and the importance of self exams

7658471 weve got to crack down on employers who are taking advantage of undocumented workers
7658472 when you read about a meatpacking plant hiring 13 year olds 14 year olds that is some of the most dangerous difficult work there is they have kids in there wielding buzz saws and cleavers its ridiculous and the only reason theyre hiring these folks is because they want to avoid paying people decent wages and providing them decent benefits

7658490 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7658491 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities it has been very much ebb and flow

7658522 you come up with some sort of media driven stunt to start a particular series of otherwise unpleasant political events
7658523 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market

7658797 between all these factors i dont think you can make the argument that the broad market is at a compelling place to get in
7658798 not the city which enthusiastically approved the creation of dozens of new neighborhoods without pausing to wonder if it could absorb the growth
7658799 certainly not the developers they built 4 397 new homes in those neighborhoods some costing half a million dollars without asking who in a city of only 80 000 could afford to buy them all

7658886 we are not now to be distracted by some of those other side issues
7658887 we have to now prove ourselves we now have to build our credibility across the electorate and certainly weve started doing that since the formation of the lnp and we need to do that in parliament this week
7658888 this is the first sitting of the parliament for a number of months
7658889 the estimates committees process and the resolution of the budget will be one of the priorities this week as will the introduction of new legislation
7658890 i expect them to be working harder than ever to earn the votes of queenslanders
7658891 the government will talk about what it wants to talk about but itll have its own issues that it needs to be held accountable to in parliament
7658892 taxation is the most costly and intrusive aspect of the interaction between government and business
7658893 it doesnt have the same general application as was the case say in the federal election where both parties could promise substantial cuts in income tax

7658906 i am not impressed with the new format while i appreciate the larger print it only serves to disguise the fact that there is less and less content in the newspaper todays mondays newspaper only had three articles on the front page and most of the page was covered by a large map with one of the articles sundays edition newspaper wasnt much to brag about either but at least it was the size of what i expect a daily newspaper to be how can you expect to keep subscribers if the content of the paper keeps on getting smaller and smaller

7658929 we are pleased to have concluded our ninth consecutive profitable quarter since our ipo in april 2006
7658930 all of our vessels in our current fleet are under three year time charters with established charterers pursuant to which we have secured 100 of our operating days for 2008 and 64 for 2009
7658931 we would like to reiterate that we are pursuing a strategy of prudent growth gradually expanding our revenue and profit generation capabilities
7658932 we remain optimistic about the long term fundamentals of the product tanker market the area of our strategic focus
7658933 finally we continued with our stable dividend policy declaring our ninth consecutive quarterly dividend of 0 50 per common share
7658934 we have now paid or declared on schedule nine consecutive quarterly dividends since going public in the amount of 0
7658935 our subordinated share structure enhances our companys ability to pay dividends to the public shareholders
7658936 as of june 30 2008 the company had a ratio of debt to market value of 54 with respect to the current eight vessel fleet and a net debt to book capitalization ratio of 63 including debt already incurred under the predelivery financing of the seven newbuildings which we believe are modest ratios for industry standards given our strong time charter coverage and the young age and quality of our fleet
7658937 the restructuring of our debt facility toward the end of the first quarter of this year has had the effect of taking advantage of our current low interest rate environment decreasing our interest expenses while at the same time it has increased our financial flexibility and will enhance our ability to pursue our strategy of prudent growth aimed at increasing shareholder value in the longer term

7659006 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7659007 its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7659008 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7659009 theres only a week and you start to concern yourself but weve shown tonight weve got a good quality of player here
7659010 we would like to add but well have to see what happens
7659011 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7659012 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7659013 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7659014 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7659015 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7659016 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7659017 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7659018 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7659019 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7659020 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7659021 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7659022 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7659023 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7659024 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7659025 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7659026 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7659027 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
7659028 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7659029 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7659030 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy
7659031 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7659032 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7659033 i havent talked with him about it favre said monday
7659034 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok
7659035 i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7659036 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but i saw the tape favre said
7659037 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7659038 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations he said
7659039 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7659040 im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7659041 i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7659042 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in later and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago he said of his debut against washington
7659043 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have had some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in that situation now than i did several weeks ago
7659044 after the game i felt ok the 38 year old favre said
7659045 yesterday morning i woke up and i said ok not too bad
7659046 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team favre said
7659047 the guy still looks great hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7659048 i am going to be on oprah september 11th on some olympic medalists special
7659049 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7659050 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7659051 phelps and his american rival ryan lochte who is also a fan of jeezy greet each other by saying juh in homage to the rapper a k a jay jenkins
7659052 it would be great if i could holler at phelps
7659053 and its a compliment that that man found inspiration in the music i do for the streets over here over there in beijing
7659054 sinds 1986 organiseren wij in september voor de opleiding frans een intensieve taalpropedeuse
7659055 op de eerste dag van die voorbereidende cursus onderwerp ik alle studenten aan een computergestuurde begintest over de franse spraakkunst aan het einde van de propedeuse waarbij de grammatica gedurende n tot twee weken grondig wordt doorgenomen leggen de studenten opnieuw een test af het gaat allemaal over stof die volgens de leerplannen op het einde van het secundair onderwijs gekend zou moeten zijn
7659056 in twee weken de periode tussen de begin en de eindtest zijn ze immers nog steeds in staat om zon 20 procent vorderingen te maken
7659057 die zogenaamde pedagogen gooien de klassieke franse spraakkunst overboord en gaan de louter communicatieve toer op je moet iets alleen nog gezegd krijgen de rest is niet belangrijk je veux un bi re is ok want zo weten de anderen tenminste dat je bier en geen soep moet hebben allemaal goed en wel maar als je onder dit publiek leerkrachten frans moet opleiden of jongeren moet zoeken die in de bedrijven goed kunnen communiceren de bedrijfswereld hunkert trouwens naar jonge mensen die frans kennen veel meer dan engels tussen haakjes de kennis van duits onder de jongeren is n g rampzaliger
7659058 want als de basiskennis frans al zo laag is bij wie die taal op universitair niveau wil gaan studeren hoe zit het dan bij de minder gemotiveerde studenten en wat als het hoger onderwijs binnenkort ook nog eens zijn slaagpercentages moet verhogen moeten wij de diplomas dan op een schoteltje geven

7659061 basketball is not part of my life right now said delle donne considered one of the top high school basketball recruits in the country
7659062 burned out on the sport and wanted to try volleyball as a senior at ursuline del academy delle donne helped lead the team to a state championship as a senior her first year on the team
7659063 playing volleyball at ursuline i was a different person she said
7659064 we certainly respect elenas decision and wish her well here at the university of delaware martin said in a statement
7659065 the door to our basketball program will always be open to her
7659066 i guess i overkilled it a little bit delle donne said of playing basketball her whole life
7659067 this is big for the sport and people need to get past whether this is an easy fight for kimbo or a tough fight they have to think about what it does for the sport
7659068 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7659069 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7659070 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7659071 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7659072 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7659073 i like to keep him covered early like a turf horse because he started off running on grass gomez said
7659074 chicken soup for the soul series of books said mott made the decision to switch go between from grass races to synthetic after the horse perked up training on the polytrack at keeneland
7659075 im as happy as can be vegso said of the prospect of a synthetic breeders cup
7659076 im looking forward to it it would be great if curlin comes if big brown comes that would be terrific competition
7659077 be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7659078 the office of insurance regulation thoroughly reviewed state farms filing and the testimony the company gave at the aug 12 public hearing
7659079 state farm did not provide appropriate support for the rate increase it requested
7659080 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7659081 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7659082 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7659083 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement
7659084 its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7659085 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7659086 theres only a week and you start to concern yourself but weve shown tonight weve got a good quality of player here
7659087 we would like to add but well have to see what happens
7659088 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7659089 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7659090 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7659091 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7659092 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7659093 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7659094 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7659095 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7659096 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7659097 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7659098 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7659099 this is one of the most unique programs of its kind in the united states
7659100 courses are taught by highly qualified faculty with industry experience they give students hands on training in specific core skills along with insider tips hard to find in a book or video on the subject

7659102 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7659103 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7659104 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7659105 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7659106 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7659107 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7659108 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7659109 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7659110 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7659111 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
7659112 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
7659113 pdx is pleased to be the first aggregator of multi pharmacy electronic prescription records to enter into a strategic relationship with google this new agreement will allow our pharmacy customers both chain and independents the ability to integrate client prescription history into google health at the users request
7659114 we believe users should have access to their prescription history and medical records and should be able to organize this information in one safe and centralized place
7659115 working with pdx will enable several nationwide pharmacies to connect with google health giving millions of patients access to their own personal data
7659116 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7659117 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7659118 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7659119 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7659120 and theres a general belief that well come out of this earlier
7659121 there are so many homes on my block that are owned by the bank that i cant compete with the prices
7659122 i cant even come close to making the house payments i think ill be moving in with family and starting from scratch
7659123 right now i think weve hit bottom and were looking at a bounce i think things are starting to look up
7659124 compared to two years ago its up exponentially theres no question
7659125 it is what in the past was considered could never happen
7659126 it was always considered that once property was built and owner occupied you would not have delinquencies in large volume
7659127 if we cant participate we cant burn through these inventories and help the market correct
7659128 there are only so many houses i can buy in cash
7659129 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty yon said
7659130 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7659131 it was kind of like if you foul a guy under the basket you get thrown out of the game
7659132 this is a very strict rule said robert beck racing commission chairman
7659133 were proud of it and were going to live by it
7659134 all disciplinary agreements approved by the commission are expected to be carried out by all parties and mr biancone is no exception said lisa underwood racing commission executive director
7659135 i cant think with clarity as though my mind no longer functions
7659136 i feel im at a dead end i have no alternatives
7659137 i know i have to do something but i dont know what to do
7659138 en t rminos de gravedad colombia est al tope los cr menes en colombia son similares en gravedad en t rminos num ricos a los cr menes cometidos en la rep blica democr tica del congo hab a 5 000 homicidios en las dos situaciones
7659139 la diferencia es que el congo reconoc a que no ten a capacidad institucional para investigar esos delitos colombia en cambio es un sistema institucional que funciona
7659140 la ley dice que si hay procedimientos nacionales mi deber es no intervenir si no los hay las investigaciones y juicios yo debo hacerlo as que mi deber en colombia es escuchar qu est n haciendo
7659141 podr a dar lugar tambi n a la intervenci n de la fiscal a de la corte penal internacional

7659144 this is a case where everyone was so enamoured and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7659145 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7659146 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7659147 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7659148 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7659149 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7659150 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7659151 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7659152 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7659153 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7659154 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armoured vehicles
7659155 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7659156 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7659157 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods

7659161 if only we could make a deal with god and get him to swap our places
7659162 its ok juan we are all going to be ok the god in space will take care of us all
7659163 the god in space let his own son die on the cross he inflicted job with boils and locusts and destroyed his crops and took away his family he made abraham agree to kill his own son and then stopped him as abraham was about to plunge the knife in how is he going to help me he doesnt seem helpful at all he seems much more into fucking with people and dont get me started on the god of paradise he makes you blow yourself up and says youll get all these virgins when you go to live with him in paradise but the thing is who wants virgins what is this thing with virgins its perverse and quite troubling to me like how old are these girls and what is the big appeal they are going to lie there scared and no matter what it is going to hurt then they will cry and they will want to know that you care for them and wont abandoned them but then youve got like 69 more virgins waiting for you and theyll have no idea what to do they wont know any of the tricks or techniques maybe theyve read some of the manuals or cosmopolitan but its not the same is it would you want to be on a flight where the pilot of the plane was undertaking his first flight after having only studied pilotry in manuals or read about it in magazines or watched movies of other pilots flying obscenely large planes flying longer and faster than is humanly possible i dont think so honey
7659164 juan you are so wise i cant wait for your new album to come out it will change everything there will be a new paradigm when will this happen
7659165 early spring of 2009 there will be single first maybe by the end of the year then the touring will start full on the videos the radio edits and all that dont worry its all going to be ok
7659166 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
7659167 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
7659168 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
7659169 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
7659170 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
7659171 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
7659172 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
7659173 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
7659174 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
7659175 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples

7659184 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7659185 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7659186 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies

7659194 during the primary i was a huge supporter of hillary clinton
7659195 they were willing to throw women completely under the bus i just couldnt believe the treatment that hillary clinton got
7659196 there may be a few outliers but overall there is going to be tremendous unity and hillary is going to be leading the charge
7659197 it makes me sad that mccain is using it against us
7659198 it may unite our party against the outsider what he said was the truth but it may unite us against him
7659199 john mccain is trying to make political hay out of an internal dispute
7659200 we think its going to be a great weekend for the state e sdrq

7659271 theres been all sorts of rumors about michelle obama and controversy around her whether it was real or imagined including what was her college thesis about did she use the term whitey something that was never substantiated
7659272 but a lot of the nation because you get these emails may believe that stuff about her
7659273 there is a buzz which i believe now to be credible that some indelible record exists of public remarks that michelle obama allegedly made which are outrageous at worst but at best but could be termed racist including some reference to white people as whiteys allegedly

7659336 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go

7659380 heres the problem if fannie mae and freddie mac collapsed then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow that it could be disastrous
7659381 id like to be able to punish them for their bad decisions but the problem is theyre too central right now to how the housing market works
7659382 i think long term what we have to do is we have to go ahead and make a decision if these are public entities then maybe they ought to get out of the profit making business
7659383 and if theyre private entities that we dont bail them out
7659384 were going to have to structure that carefully how we make that transition in order that we dont get the housing market even more spooked than it already is
7659385 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers

7659391 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7659392 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7659393 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are

7659411 i took the job for money but also i knew it would be interesting in some sense
7659412 i didnt know a novel would come out of it
7659413 im trying to maintain my distance the first time i was so anxious about the novel

7659418 raes not afraid to illuminate the most pained or shameful facets of her characters but she does so without a sense of exhibitionism and with genuine compassion
7659419 the convicted murderer charles in no one tells everything for instance is one of those characters i cant quite let go of long after reading the book im thinking in particular of the smaller moments that show him trying to connect with people trying to think through and accomplish what everyone else does effortlessly the kind of emotional acuity she achieves in her novels is no small feat and she accomplishes it flawlessly
7659420 her characters have secrets sometimes things they are trying to hide even from themselves they remind me of russian nesting dolls that are revealed to the reader only one layer at a time certainly this is true in her latest book
7659421 rae possesses that wonderful medley of gifts as a writer originality precision and compassion what i like best about her work is that she creates characters that are very complex and she manages to write about them with a mix of toughness and tenderness she knows how to tell a story how to pace a narrative and how to turn a phrase some people are just born to write novels rae strikes me as one of those people

7659445 not cutting obama a break at all and as far as i can tell youre giving mccain a pass
7659446 while appreciating his desire to institute policies that will reduce the need for abortion i utterly detest obamas support of abortion abortion is a heinous abomination and violation of our most sacred human right the right to life and his support of taxpayer supported abortions is an egregious violation of the consciences of millions of americans who consider abortion to be morally reprehensible
7659447 lord you have my life in your hands and i put my trust in you
7659448 why is it so hard for me to take better care of myself what am i doing wrong or not doing in order for me to do whats important for me

7659466 as world leaders in the field of engineering contracting and construction services mrslns expertise is critical to the success of the demonstration reactor project while the licencing and environmental impact assessment process for the demonstration power plant still need to be successfully completed the signing of the epcm contract represents a significant milestone for pbmr
7659467 our focus as a company is on developing and using this technology for the benefit of south africa we have already achieved many successes in this regard we have created a large pool of intellectual resources locally and a sizeable world class company as the signing of this contract shows we partner with the best suppliers in the world globally the work we are doing is having a significant impact
7659468 antigamente a coisa era feia o pessoal entrava com isopor de cerveja e la ava as mulheres mesmo
7659469 we decided it was about time that the relevant parties joined forces to resolve the ongoing problems that have been highlighted by a number of our members the aim of the meeting was to discuss the issues at hand and decide on a constructive way forward
7659470 we are aware that the problems cannot be resolved overnight but we feel that this is a step in the right direction and both the nhbrc and the mbsa are committed to positive change and the improvement of procedures to strengthen our industry
7659471 in the last field particularly the mba western cape has for many years been the acknowledged leader

7659473 industrial rentals in particular are sustaining the robust growth we saw during the first quarter of 2008
7659474 this is particularly impressive when one takes into account building cost inflation even though this is expected to have grown by 20 on a year ago we nevertheless still saw real rental growth in all of these industrial areas barring port elizabeth
7659475 it still remains to be seen what effect the energy crisis and in particular eskoms moratorium on new developments could have on the industry
7659476 once youve taken 20 building cost inflation into account the probability is that in spite of their growth none of these decentralized office nodes will show positive real growth over the past year
7659477 the non residential market has been a sellers market since 2003 but under the current circumstances it could now turn to being a buyers one however the prospects of strong rental growth could still provide a negotiating lifeline for sellers
7659478 one of the ways of determining the value of an income producing property is by discounting the expected future income stream by a required hurdle opportunity cost rate
7659479 thus the sharp deceleration or strengthening in hurdle rates since 2000 serves as an indication of how favourable investor sentiment was towards non residential properties

7659494 fianna f il mindlessly propped up by the green party and the progressive democrats have clearly made a lot promises to their supporters in the building trade that they feel cannot be undone no matter what logic it defies or what damage it does to the economy as a whole

7659504 we do know the fire started upstairs where he was she was downstairs away from the fire the fact she smelled the smoke made it possible for here to get out
7659505 the investigators will do a full investigation hell go through everything piece by piece dismantle and sift through the ash and debris itll take some time to try to come up with a definite answer to what caused the fire

7659511 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7659512 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7659513 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7659514 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7659515 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7659516 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7659517 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7659518 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7659519 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7659520 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

7659522 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7659523 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7659524 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

7659530 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7659531 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7659532 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7659533 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7659534 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup

7659538 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7659539 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7659540 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7659541 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7659543 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here

7659548 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7659549 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7659550 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children

7659559 after the storm you couldnt feel sorry for yourself because everyone was in the same boat
7659560 you had to go to work immediately and begin rebuilding neighbors helped neighbors the communities were drawn closer
7659561 at gulfview alone of 65 staff members only about five had a house after katrina
7659562 only about a dozen of the 550 students still had homes
7659563 i was an administrator at gulfview for about ten years it was an old school each time they needed more space they would build a new building with the new school weve combined the original seven buildings into one everything will be under one roof it will be much safer and more secure for our children
7659564 south hancock elementary is a prime example of how south mississippi is rebuilding bigger and better
7659565 the new school has been elevated to better protect the facility from future storms
7659566 everywhere we go people are asking about the progress on the school
7659567 it has really energized the community i look forward to the grand opening so people can see that the inside is as amazing as the outside
7659568 ive had the pleasure of seeing the work going on at the school and many of our workers are actually local residents
7659569 you can see a true sense of pride and accomplishment in their faces this is big for the communities of south hancock county
7659570 we are proud of the progress being made in hancock county
7659571 south hancock elementary is on pace to be one of the first public schools in south mississippi to reopen its doors after being completely rebuilt
7659572 we are increasing resources by combining them its more efficient
7659573 since we began construction more people have begun moving back to the area and started rebuilding
7659574 in the last two weeks prior to the beginning of the school year registration has gone up tremendously
7659575 south hancock will be our second biggest elementary we didnt expect that just a couple of months ago
7659576 the opening of the schools will send a message out there we were ground zero of the storm if ground zero can come back everyone can
7659577 im proud of our teachers and staff for hanging in there
7659578 very few teachers left after the storm thats a testament to their dedication to the students some of our teachers have even postponed retirement i think the children saw that attitude and picked up on it
7659579 fema and mema have been nothing but helpful from day one we have no complaints theyve provided much needed assistance and were always there with the answers
7659580 even though its a beautiful facility well be putting some beautiful children in there when it opens
7659581 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

7659640 when a crime brings them back to l a fugitive ex con dom toretto diesel reignites his feud with agent brian oconner walker but as they are forced to confront a shared enemy dom and brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmanuever him and from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines two men will find the best way to get revenge push the limits of whats possible behind the wheel

7659651 despite fare increases air new zealand continues to only partially recover the increase in the total cost of fuel
7659652 we werent actually expecting to get all the way here
7659653 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7659654 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours
7659655 ya lo he dicho y lo sigo deciendo la ucr necesita de una reorganizaci n con una camada de nuevos dirigentes que se sumen a aquellos que est n actualmente en la estructura partidaria y los que est n distanciados incluso con referentes como carri y l pez murphy
7659656 la ucr necesita de una reorganizaci n en la que participen todos los dirigentes del pa s incluso aquellos que se han ido hace tiempo
7659657 ernesto sanz el diputado oscar aguad y el propio vicepresidente julio cobos son los que pueden llevar adelante una renovaci n y no hay que pedir amnist a ni permiso yo estoy trabajando en ese sector
7659658 el radicalismo debe construir una fuerza nacional que se transforme en una alternativa al populismo y liberalismo que tuvo m xima expresi n durante el gobierno de menem
7659659 lideramos la oposici n y esto coadyuv a que recuperemos la simpat a de la sociedad y ahora tenemos que recuperar su confianza
7659660 nos estamos reuniendo todas las semanas con los gobernadores y dirigentes del partido para terminar de dar forma a esta idea para luego presentarla y llevarla a la pr ctica
7659661 sigue siendo el mismo de siempre trabajar por una renovaci n dirigencial en nuestro partido sin necesidad de amnist as porque no es necesario pedir permiso para fortalecer al radicalismo desde el punto de vista org nico
7659662 no estoy de acuerdo con eso de usar la palabra amnist a
7659663 dentro de la uni n c vica radical tenemos dirigentes que pueden formar nuevos espacios sin necesidad de pedirle permiso a nadie y estamos trabajando para eso
7659664 el radicalismo funciona como espacio de discusi n de pol ticas de fondo como catalizador del clamor social pero observamos que la organizaci n partidaria nacional no est a la altura de las circunstancias
7659665 tenemos una larga deuda social y cultural con el pa s profundo
7659666 tenemos una larga deuda social y cultural con el pa s profundo
7659667 bei leichten verletzungen kann es ansonsten zu starken blutungen kommen
7659668 me arrependo de coisas que disse mas jamais de meu sil ncio
7659669 so far each time i have gone there is never food or clean water and from what i understand people have been coming in netting them and i guess eating them
7659670 its not fun for him but its fun for the other guys in the locker room
7659671 its real tough a little unrealistic if you ask me
7659672 its not a confidence issue with me at all its never been
7659673 ni abjasia ni osetia del sur volver n a vivir en el mismo estado que georgia
7659674 es nuestro destino geopol tico tr gico pero nadie puede legalizar la anexi n de territorios georgianos
7659675 respetar la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia
7659676 no depend a de la decisi n de un solo
7659677 supongo que el presidente ruso no va a firmar esta resoluci n ya que provocar a una situaci n muy dif cil y cr tica para la seguridad territorial de georgia
7659678 we have talked about some of the enthusiasm some of the excitement the young guys bring just not being tarnished and having any of the blemishes weve had in the past
7659679 those guys bring a little different attitude and sometimes its a good position not to know
7659680 even though theyre young a lot of these guys are really good really exciting to watch
7659681 they are real hungry to prove theyre the best and saturday night is the proving ground for them im excited to watch that
7659682 the backdrop for this one is kind of special it is one of our major rivals and there really is no real way to prepare those guys for that kind of environment
7659683 i think they will be primed and eager to play and play well in this environment
7659684 anytime you give the ball to somebody and he has a chance to score every time he touches it thats fun
7659685 having printer dots secretly scattered on everything you print which indelibly connect your print out to the printer it came from and even the time and date it was printed is a major privacy violation wherever you are
7659686 its even worse when those printers are being used by dissidents living under authoritarian regimes wasnt the printing press supposed to spread freedom not automatically finger enemies of the state
7659687 for as long as there has been currency there have been counterfeiters
7659688 many customers seek the protection of counterfeit detection particularly banking and financial institutions
7659689 weve reached a point where so much customer information is sold to third parties that most people have resigned themselves to this fact of life personally and professionally
7659690 i do wonder if the dots can be removed when hard drive erase on an imaging printing device is invoked
7659691 sorry but for security reasons i cannot discuss the details of the technology
7659692 such processing may give rise to the violation of fundamental human rights namely the right to privacy and private life
7659693 it also might violate the right to protection of personal data
7659694 there is no transparency and no accountability there should be
7659695 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7659696 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7659697 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket
7659698 these kids dont have 200 or 300 dollars to spend on a phone although theyd like to the blitz is cool enough that you dont have to be branded as the person using the cheap phone in school
7659699 the blitz looks like a nice addition to the lineup and really optimized in a way that this demographic uses their devices where messaging and music is as important as phone calls
7659700 from the sounds that disappear to the changes we begin to fear
7659701 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7659702 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7659703 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7659704 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7659705 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7659706 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7659707 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7659708 its a prophetic tattoo prophecy is ragged and dirty so make it ragged and dirty
7659709 its nice to know that you have one of the best pitchers in the american league or all of baseball going
7659710 but we try to just not think about that too much
7659711 ive thrown everything at them so i just want to execute my pitches ive got four quality pitches i can use at any time in any count im just going to pitch my game
7659712 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7659713 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7659714 i would not be surprised if all three quarterbacks played at certain times
7659715 whatever the coach thinks is best we trust coach miles completely in our preparation
7659716 however hes going to handle it im sure will be best for the team and on an individual basis im just focusing on my job and working hard each day
7659717 cuando quieres algo todo el universo conspira para que realices tu deseo
7659718 solo una cosa hace que un sue o sea imposible el miedo a fracasar
7659719 la b squeda de la alegia es mas importante que la necesidad del dolor
7659720 todas las batallas sirven para algo incluso aquellasen las que somos derrotados
7659721 es justamente la posibilidad de realizar un sue o lo que hace que la vida sea mas interesante
7659722 la nica manera de salvar nuestros sue os es siendo generosos con nosotros mismos
7659723 nunca desistas de tus sue os sigue las se ales
7659724 cando alguien desea algo tiene que saber que est corriendo riesgos pero es esto justamente loque hace que la vida sea interesante
7659725 no todos poden ver los sue os de la misma manera
7659726 it the incident was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his fifteen minutes of fame my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7659727 i was hoping i was going to be there last night but im obviously not
7659728 i would love to go tomorrow morning at the latest
7659729 but theres rumors there might be floor session i still dont know i dont know were all in limbo here
7659730 se houver algum caso o funcion rio ser exonerado na mesma hora
7659731 iremos oficiar cada deputado para que assuma a responsabilidade de dizer se tem ou n o parente de at terceiro grau empregado desta maneira que iremos proceder cada gabinete ser comunicado oficialmente e os deputados v o ter que atestar que n o est o ferindo a legisla o se houver algum caso o funcion rio ser exonerado na mesma hora
7659732 theres only a week to go and you start to concern yourself a little bit
7659733 i think we showed against portsmouth that weve got good quality players here
7659734 wed obviously like to add to the squad and we are looking at some things
7659735 he called me after the game with bordeaux lost 2 0 in front of setanta sports cameras and i accepted to meet him nantes can be an interesting club
7659736 secara sejarah kami memang selalu kesulitan bila tampil di fratton park tahun lalu kami bermain imbang disini sementara sebelumnya kami menelan kekalahan jadi kemenangan ini merupakan bonus buat kami
7659737 i beg aek fans to pardon me but i cant refuse such offer
7659738 part of the reason home prices are declining is a fundamental deterioration in the housing stock
7659739 during the boom nine out of 10 houses for sale in many markets were in prime condition now for every 10 houses at least three are dogs
7659740 ive never seen so many houses in this condition before
7659741 and ive been in the business 20 years ive seen bank owned properties in the past they were never like this
7659742 the first one i saw was the worst home i had ever seen in my life
7659743 there were magic marker messages on the front door saying stay out they had poured paint and other stuff on the carpets there was a lot of trash i felt like i was at the scene of a crime i wouldnt let my daughters touch anything
7659744 you find maggots the swimming pools are green the lawns dry up theyre eyesores neighbors yell at us to water the lawn
7659745 all the kitchen appliances cabinets and countertops bathroom fixtures lights are stolen
7659746 they punch holes in the walls dump oil on the carpets the banks are so overwhelmed they havent gotten to the point when they send in crews to fix them up
7659747 a three year old home that recently sold for 660 000 is listed for 350 000 theres no kitchen no master bath the toilet was taken the tub cabinets gone
7659748 once buyers start to feel confident that prices in a given community have stabilized theyll start buying again
7659749 once that inventory is gone well be at the market bottom and the price trajectory will flatten out
7659750 wir werden amerika auf diesem parteitag zeigen warum wir barack obama und joe biden im weissen haus brauchen
7659751 heute abend hat das amerikanische volk die gelegenheit senator obama von neuem kennenzulernen und von jenen die ihn am besten kennen ber seine werte zu erfahren
7659752 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7659753 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7659754 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7659755 but i had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go
7659756 i havent worried about that because i dont control that
7659757 i feel like ive done a lot for this team over the last five years ive had some unfortunate things happen to me and some bad games but for the most part i feel like ive been a pretty good contributor to this organization
7659758 weve won a lot of games when ive played im proud of a lot of things ive done and im not paying attention to anyone or anything that will try to tell me otherwise
7659759 i felt like this was a great option for me to come back and start
7659760 it didnt happen but the seasons just around the corner im not anticipating anything happening but ive got to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career ive got to take off and be ready to go
7659761 its something i have to deal with right now but im going to make sure i do whatever i need to do to make sure im a great player in this league
7659762 my personal goals havent changed my role in the immediate future has changed but my outlook hasnt changed at all
7659763 he talked to you all today so that says a lot you do need a little time when a decision like that is made but rex is a team player hes a professional he has a job hes a big part of what we like to do we have a lot of players in the role that rex is in right now
7659764 there is nothing i would like more than to compete at a home olympics
7659765 it is a huge motivational factor to compete at london
7659766 ill have two months off to relax and switch off and spend some time discussing my future with the coaching staff i am sure i will keep going i will make an announcement soon in terms of what i will definitely do
7659767 unless you fall off it is not a high impact sport
7659768 yeah baby your turning me on with those corners oh the backboards oh my god chipped paint im cumming
7659769 political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7659770 in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about
7659771 lack a kind of deeper storyline or the expression of the feelings of the characters
7659772 critics and those with a self interest in keeping the status quo
7659773 general contractors manage all aspects of your project including hiring and supervising subcontractors getting building permits and scheduling inspections

7659775 designers have expertise in specific areas of the home such as kitchens and baths

7659920 le donne sono come le mele sugli alberi le migliori sono sulla cima dellalbero molti uomini non vogliono arrivare alle migliori hanno paura di cadere e ferirsi in cambio prendono le mele marce che sono cadute a terra e che pur non essendo cos buone sono facili da raggiungere perci le mele che stanno sulla cima dellalbero pensano che qualcosa non vada in loro mentre in realt esse sono grandiose semplicemente devono essere pazienti e aspettare che luomo giusto arrivi colui che sia cosi coraggioso da arrampicarsi fino alla cima dellalbero per esse non dobbiamo cadere per essere raggiunte chi avr bisogno di noi e ci ama far di tutto per raggiungerci la donna usc dalla costola delluomo non dai piedi per essere calpestata n dalla testa per essere superiore ma dal lato per essere uguale sotto il braccio per essere protetta e accanto al cuore per essere amata

7659923 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7659924 shes on her way to the little country of georgia
7659925 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7659926 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
7659927 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
7659928 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
7659929 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
7659930 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellant relatively little is known about how it actually works
7659931 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellants are compared
7659932 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7659933 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7659934 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7659935 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7659936 it was too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream especially when i realized that many of them have supported my musical career
7659937 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7659938 shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7659939 youre a young kid in college and you want to do everything at once
7659940 obviously the first couple weeks im going to be dead tired
7659941 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7659942 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7659943 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7659944 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7659945 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7659946 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7659947 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7659948 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7659949 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7659950 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7659951 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7659952 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7659953 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7659954 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7659955 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7659956 its about a vibrant society its really at the height of its power and the height of its decadence at the same time
7659957 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go
7659958 this is probably one of the most thorough and detailed looks anyone has done for this website your ability to channel the user and get into their heads is scary in the really good way of course
7659959 your report is the best money ive ever spent on the internet
7659960 things should be made as simple as possible but not any simpler

7659990 this software is a critical component of the statewide information technology infrastructure hssc is in the process of building
7659991 we are excited to provide the technology for such a valuable initiative for health sciences south carolina and the state of south carolina
7659992 while cutting edge institutions around the globe have adopted the collexis system including the national institutes of health johns hopkins mayo clinic and others the south carolina database is the first statewide system in the united states
7659993 the collaboration between south carolina based collexis and hssc demonstrates the amazing research and technological advancements taking place throughout the state what
7659994 matching the right physicians with the right colleague in research could bring the greatest discoveries for new treatments
7659995 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7659996 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7659997 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7659998 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7659999 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
