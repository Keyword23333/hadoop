2650023 this decision was made after the expansion of new rounds of sanctions against iran so that irans assets are not blocked in foreign banks the

2650026 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up he said after the rally

2650032 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2650033 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2650034 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2650035 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2650036 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2650037 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2650038 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2650039 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted
2650040 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers mr james said

2650061 i love you too buddy but daddys gotta spank you
2650062 was i anything like this when i was his age
2650063 you were a perfect angel i dont know where he gets it from
2650064 its karma pure and simple its payback for all the fucked up shit we put your mom through growing up
2650065 why in the hell didnt you beat me more when i was a kid
2650066 because i couldnt very well spank you when you hugged me gave me the look of an angel and in the sweetest voice told me you loved me thatd be downright criminal
2650067 the beta release is free the release version of the application is currently priced at 69 95
2650068 this was a superb race for me i was on the podium for the second time this year and podiums were on our to do list for this season
2650069 i had a bad start on the dirty side of the track and lost a place to kimi raikkonen but anyway both lewis hamilton and he have clearly been faster today so a better start would not have changed much
2650070 i had some difficulties with the second and third sets of tyres and it was not easy to race against a ghost of course i knew i was racing fernando alonso but due to the different strategies he wasnt visible to me fernando was faster than me almost everywhere and put me under pressure but he didnt have a proper chance to overtake as this is very difficult here
2650071 that was not only a great result points wise but it was also the best result so far for our team
2650072 nick third and on the podium and robert fifth that means ten important points to date we have never managed to get more than that with the bmw sauber f1 team in a single race that is fantastic

2650074 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
2650075 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
2650076 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices
2650077 the united states has since 911 become very aware of any vulnerability that exists in our national defenses we have done a great deal to tighten our security but in the area of energy we remain somewhat defenseless i say this because by importing 70 of the fuel that we use to produce energy we leave our whole infrastructure wide open to attack oil tankers and pipelines are virtually undefended across vast stretches of the globe and a concerted attack on our energy supply line could cripple our country in a fairly short period of time if however we move toward self sufficiency in producing energy we eliminate this risk we are much better able to protect our infrastructure within our borders than we are able to do it across the globe this is just one more reason why we must develop a plan whereby we produce most or all of our own fuel domestically nearly 100 000 of us at the pickens plan are working toward a plan for domestic energy production

2650080 janet is the hottest score debut ive seen in a very long time black or white she has it all i know its early but janet has my vote for 2008 newcomer of the year hands down
2650081 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2650082 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2650083 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2650084 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2650085 ive obviously got to shoot some pretty good numbers coming in and tear up the course
2650086 if i can get back to something like even par that will be nice but the whole course is a lot easier so i dont think youll see scores slipping down any more
2650087 after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the rest of the round
2650088 i couldnt come back after that eight because i was mad
2650089 i was fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round
2650090 i saw early on that he was playing way back on my first serve

2650096 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2650097 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2650098 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2650099 criminalization is a poor tool for regulating h i v infection and transmission
2650100 let one of the conference outcomes be a major international push back against misguided criminal laws and prosecutions
2650101 there is no public health rationale for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit h i v or expose others to it
2650102 criminalization is warranted only where someone sets out knowing he has h i v to infect another and succeeds
2650103 the man was punished not for what he did but for the virus he carried
2650104 we must be better at using it in prevention practice
2650105 the 25 000 participants are now accountable to push their governments
2650106 we still have five new infections for every two patients
2650107 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2650108 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2650109 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2650110 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2650111 this like a dream we started by winning the suruga cup in japan and now we want to add a new title against boca
2650112 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2650126 paul welday with his heavy gop connections and lobbying background is qualified to be a state rep but resumes arent everything in this election party isnt everything in this election there is still much healing to be had in lansing before we can see an effective state legislature we need cooperation leadership and a shared vision of how to turn this state around now that doesnt include time consuming partisan bickering and posturing that weve seen in recent sessions
2650127 the biggest name in the gop race is paul welday 49 of farmington hills a former executive director of the oakland county republican party who has most recently worked as a lobbyist hes a skilled political strategist who knows lansing and many of its leaders and he is well versed on the states economic issues however what political newcomer richard lerner lacks in political connections he more than makes up for with thoughtful specific ideas about repealing the michigan business tax making the states expenditures accessible to the public online and setting a 100 day legislative agenda after which lawmakers would be docked pay for every day of gridlock lerner 49 of farmington hills would be a solid issues oriented challenger for democrat vicki barnett a former farmington hills mayor who is unopposed on the democratic side

2650138 it is terrifying to see how easily in certain people all dignity collapses yet when you think about it this is quite normal since they only maintain this dignity by constantly striving against their own nature

2650141 aim for success not perfection never give up your right to be wrong because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can paradoxically make yourself a happier and more productive person

2650150 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2650151 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2650152 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2650153 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2650154 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2650155 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2650156 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2650157 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2650158 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue

2650225 just look at him so sleek so powerful so beautiful like some great golden god made flesh of course any sensible god would demand absolute obedience in return for his favor but no our man of steel protects us and keeps us with no strings attached and the people hmm they practically worship him anyway
2650226 it is a remarkable dichotomy in many ways clark is the most human of us all then he shoots fire from the skies and it is difficult not to think of him as a god and how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him
2650227 dont you fret weve got god on our side or the next best thing anyway
2650228 the apocalypse marks the end of an old world and the emergence of a new but the emphasis is on the end of the current order of things
2650229 doomsday was basically the macguffin of the story its not important where he came from hes a force of nature and he kills superman
2650230 people who didnt know any better were like oh my goodness superman is going to die
2650231 the dying god model has been most useful to the postmythological writer as a source of metaphors that can suggest psychic spiritual or emotional rebirth or the lack of it
2650232 okay wise guys if we kill him then what happens
2650233 we were at a point where valiant were publishing all these antiheroes who would shoot first and ask questions later they were the exact opposite of superman and maybe thats why he was falling out of favor we resented that and took it upon ourselves to show people that they shouldnt take superman for granted
2650234 i think a lot of people still have this notion that we just had this big abomination smash and pound him in the ground and died but the idea was that superman gets to the point where the only way he can stop this creature is to basically sacrifice himself hes going to have to go to the point where he loses in order to defeat doomsday
2650235 the blockbusting scuffle finally proved that supermans heroism his tireless defense of humanity was never the result of his physical superiority and alien origins it came from his character
2650236 the descent into death can also be seen as a metaphor for a psychological descent into the unconscious any rebirth or resurrection then would seem to speak not only to the question of physical fertility but also to hope of overcoming the brokenness of the ordinary life in favor of the achievement of full individuation
2650237 please meestar i will be punished if you are found here jail for you leave now quickly
2650238 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
2650239 i saw early on that he was playing way back on my first serve

2650242 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2650243 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2650244 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2650245 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2650246 i feel better from the right side than from the left side
2650247 but today in that particular at bat in the seventh inning i was feeling my legs as a hitter thats what you want you want to feel your legs and see the ball and hit the ball there are times you get caught up in thinking too much
2650248 jerrys gonna put guys where it is best for the team i have no problem with that it really doesnt make any difference

2650282 it sounds reasonable enough until you realise that one of the parties uncles is talking about is the
2650283 i realised the english democrats were working with england first and had no choice other than to resign there and then
2650284 they try to present themselves as respectable middle england with leading members being solicitors and housewives
2650285 it is highly unlikely that he will get elected if two english parties stand in the same area
2650286 no meeting was ever agreed to or sanctioned by the nc of our party

2650302 ambos candidatos en esta elecci n se comprometieron a terminar esta guerra y traer a los soldados a casa la gran diferencia es que yo pretendo ganar primero

2650304 lo que falta es el juicio de un comandante en jefe

2650310 we can not allow fear and terror caused by organized crime to take control of our nation
2650311 a large amount of armoured vehicles has been concentrated at the lars border crossing
2650312 around 100 items of heavy artillery were delivered through the roki tunnel
2650313 the people here are worried this conflict could come closer to the capital considering the gradual increase of russian forces around georgian borders
2650314 russian jet fighters have dropped three bombs on tbilisis airport
2650315 civilians were hit very hard by these attacks allegedly targeting military facilities but not doing a very good job of it
2650316 fired on tskhinvali methodically all night but for now a relative calm has settled in the city
2650317 the city is almost fully destroyed civilians left in the city are hiding in bomb shelters and basements
2650318 earlier today russian jet fighters bombed two villages in the upper part of the gorge
2650319 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2650320 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2650321 the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory

2650324 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2650325 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is also a fabulous woman
2650326 bachmans is in the business of helping families express their sentiments in times of joy and in times of sorrow
2650327 we are simply overwhelmed with the gratitude and the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world the calls and e mails were receiving are from peoples hearts and they speak so well of this extraordinary man
2650328 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time
2650329 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2650330 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2650331 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2650332 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2650333 he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2650334 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe
2650335 some of which are toxic and some of which deplete the ozone layer
2650336 it is very unlikely that people will get cancer from having their clothes drycleaned

2650339 and the other time we had some confusion as to who was in the personnel group

2650341 i was frustrated and i know todd was frustrated it deeply hurt us because thats when the bills went in

2650368 se algu m tinha d vida de que o bc traria a infla o de 2009 pr ximo da meta agora ela diminuiu
2650369 n o tenho d vidas de que o recuo das commodities dar al vio infla o em 2009
2650370 pela primeira vez em tr s anos acredito que os pre os das commodities est o em queda e devem se acomodar em 2009

2650375 one of the most underrated cure alls for any sort of crisis is to make a good old cup of tea it might sound old fashioned and it is but old remedies do work thats why theyre old herbal teas can be very soothing they work on your central nervous system to calm and balance it try peppermint jasmine lemongrass infuse green tea with ginger very cleansing for your liver the seat of anger rosehip and chamomile add a teaspoon of organic honey if its hard to get used to the taste the main thing is to avoid caffeinated drinks such as colas and coffee at this time these drain the adrenal glands and when you are under stress thats already happening to the max give your glands a break be a natural hippy chick and go herbal instead
2650376 juntas as a es de petrobr s vale e de companhias sider rgicas que tamb m s o ligadas s commodities correspondem a 41 do ibovespa

2650379 nossa estimativa de que o mercado acion rio ficar ruim pelos pr ximos 18 meses
2650380 os pre os das commodities subiram tanto que se criou a expectativa de uma queda no consumo
2650381 nos estados unidos por exemplo os consumidores j reduziram as compras de gasolina
2650382 olhando por esse lado v se que as grandes empresas do setor como a vale continuam projetando que os pre os das commodities permanecer alto
2650383 a demanda continuar aquecida mas n o crescer na mesma velocidade
2650384 os mais otimistas prev em uma expans o de 1 para o pib produto interno bruto americano em cada um dos pr ximos tr s anos
2650385 h uma desacelera o importante em pa ses como jap o inglaterra e it lia
2650386 at porque muitas empresas n o t m capital aberto no pa s
2650387 o setor de constru o por exemplo que muito importante economicamente s recentemente foi para a bolsa
2650388 se n o chover dentro de quatro meses a obra fica pronta
2650389 todo esse atraso resultado de uma conjun o de problemas
2650390 al m disso no nosso caso s o cinco concess es para resolver todos os problemas normal haver atrasos isso ocorreu em concess es passadas
2650391 ainda n o se chama muito a classe c de classe m dia mas n o h d vida de que ela est na crista da onda a menina dos olhos das empresas e j est inclu da socialmente o que n o uma caracter stica de classe baixa
2650392 eu acho um pouco demais j que estamos falando de um n vel muito b sico de consumo
2650393 n o precisa ter nem casa pr pria nem carro
2650394 a classe c pode comprar um plano de sa de ou de previd ncia e mandar os filhos para escola particular
2650395 a maioria esmagadora no brasil se diz pobre o que visto como uma posi o boa que d direitos simb licos
2650396 brutal imediato se acertar as condi es da oferta que possibilitem o acesso maluca a vontade que ela tem de consumir o que a classe m dia tradicional j consome
2650397 agora a demanda cresceu tanto que eles n o conseguem suprir
2650398 hoje eles navegam muito em comunidades virtuais que formam opini o sobre marcas e produtos esse consumidor bem informado come a a ter o mesmo crit rio de qualidade atualizado dos mais ricos que permite distinguir o que bacana e moderno
2650399 nenhum neg cio hoje p ra de p se n o estiver olhando a classe c a n o ser que seja voltado a um nicho
2650400 h uma vis o de que a classe m dia um estado de esp rito
2650401 esta nova classe m dia baixa extremamente ambiciosa din mica confiante em si mesma e tem valores mais s lidos
2650402 as classes mais pobres n o t m essa multiplicidade de contatos que ajuda os filhos a subirem
2650403 tanto na inglaterra onde a lei a respeito draconiana como na fran a houve l gico um impacto inicial mas depois as pessoas ajustaram seus h bitos s novas regras

2650405 para chamar aten o por um tempo v lido mas nenhuma empresa pode manter isso no escopo de seus neg cios
2650406 a lei habilitante uma emboscada para passar de contrabando a reforma constitucional que o povo recusou

2650409 estou muito feliz sabia que ia ser uma prova muito dura

2650418 eu me sinto seguro porque fiz o treinamento todo bem feito abdiquei de muita coisa este ano tudo est timo para mim depois de enfrentar uma cirurgia artroscopia no joelho e uma dengue
2650419 estou radiante agora sou um atleta ol mpico pensei que iria ficar nervoso deixei para ligar para minha m e em cima da hora pois as pessoas ficam nervosas e acabam passando isso para a gente mas n o senti a press o e consegui fazer o planejado
2650420 durante a terceira diagonal mudei o movimento pois achei que estava um pouco baixo e poderia me desequilibrar e perder pontos importantes preferi fazer o mais simples perdi um d cimo mas garanti uma boa nota e n o corri riscos
2650421 na final vou fazer o hyp lito na primeira diagonal e a terceira ser completa vou tentar uma nota 16 800 ou 16 900
2650422 com o primeiro lugar o diego deve ser um dos primeiros a se apresentar na final isso bom porque d moral e os rbitros v o analis lo como aquele que teve a 1 nota mas tamb m ele n o ter a oportunidade de ver antes o desempenho dos advers rios
2650423 prefiro que estejam todos bem para que n o digam depois que faltou algu m para enfrentar
2650424 acho que at dava para conseguir ir final mas n o quero perder a concentra o no solo minhas chances s o grandes e n o quero deixar que nada me prejudique
2650425 vou correndo para a vila ol mpica porque estou com fome ainda n o comi
2650426 como shostakovich ela se sentia sem for as se n o estivesse grudada terra russa
2650427 ela confidencia ao filho em seu r quiem que se atirou aos p s do carrasco na in til tentativa de obter a sua liberta o
2650428 ela agiu como qualquer mulher russa agiria naquele tempo entregando o filho aos cuidados da governante ou sogra
2650429 ela era lac nica e s vezes mandava cart es postais para ele que considerava ofensivo receb los no lugar de cartas
2650430 eu queria escrever sobre as ruas mas precisaria falar de bueiros pedrinhas e sem foros ent o pensei que a rodovi ria seria uma rua sem cal adas
2650431 rio fundo e corrente que corta a cidade com gente de todo tipo que chega e vai embora que corre e perde suas muletas que conversa com o papai noel
2650432 se o mundo um lugar onde passam dezenas de freiras buli osas segurando pranchas de surfe onde h chicletes por toda parte e uma senhora acende velas no guarda volumes como eu acredito piamente ent o a rodovi ria o mundo
2650433 onde nada de estrondoso parece acontecer e tudo se perde na multid o mas h detalhes inacredit veis e pessoas jogando pife pafe enquanto aguardam a partida do nibus
2650434 ao terminar cheguei a uma conclus o negativa eu achava que era um lugar de desencontros e tristezas
2650435 depois de 5 anos relendo o texto vejo que muito mais um lugar de pequenos encontros de momentos sutis de hist rias extraordin rias
2650436 h v rias formas de escutar as coisas e acho bom experimentar o m ximo poss vel delas
2650437 em certos dias ia com um prop sito certo visitar o balc o de informa es os banheiros
2650438 em outros apenas vagava pelos corredores puxando conversa e arrumando encrenca
2650439 porque s vezes a conversa era t o tranq ila que perguntar sobrenome e rg era a ltima coisa que se aplicava no momento
2650440 o mundo n o faz necessariamente sentido e eu adoro essas pequenas bobagens que s vezes revelam muito e nada ao mesmo tempo
2650441 poss vel se valer mais de t cnicas e no es de fic o para fazer reportagem sem preju zo do texto
2650442 o objetivo foi emular a bagun a est tica e polif nica do tiet
2650443 meu av j surdo querendo escutar as aves pintadas no c u da igreja
2650444 com certeza o local ser valorizado o essencial deve ser preservado mas n o se pode imobilizar a cidade
2650445 cada bairro tem sua pr pria din mica e isso levado em conta quando os t cnicos analisam os processos
2650446 nunca houve a inten o de tombar esses im veis na lapa a maioria deles n o tem valor hist rico o que ocorreu foi que a lei de zoneamento de 2004 os incluiu automaticamente em processo de tombamento
2650447 tombar por tombar sem dar uma finalidade cultural ao bem erro n o podemos tombar reas e transformar bairros em cidades fantasmas
2650448 n o s a reurbaniza o poss vel como o espa o da linha f rrea que passa ali permite um projeto de linha do metr de superf cie
2650449 militar tem aquele orgulho de vestir a farda sabe mas a gente tem de tirar a farda vestir uniforme dom stico e limpar banheiro passear com cachorro arrumar cama lavar roupa da fam lia inteira inclusive cuecas e calcinhas de genros e noras e tudo com o dedo da mulher do general na nossa cara

2650701 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2650702 it has been very much his strategy to make this an international conflict between the traditional west and russia speaking in language of the cold war and saying that this is really the last frontier
2650703 what we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between i am sorry to say that moscow and the entire west because now russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens up to 80 per cent of south ossetian population have russian passports

2650752 at the turn of the 21st century there were a series of attempts to commercialize digital content by enforcing an antiquated notion called copyright the right to control who could make copies all of which obviously failed

2650765 sure social network ads are crap but googles ads are solid right after all theyre set by the open market
2650766 well google owns the ad inventory they can sell it for whatever they want its still a free market even if they choose not to sell it for cheap
2650767 it doesnt matter what the market values the keywords at if we cant cover our costs were not selling
2650768 were in for another massive internet economy collapse if google ever loses its monopoly and is forced to truly compete on price

2650814 they have the power to do it its about having the guts to do it
2650815 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told channel 9
2650816 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2650817 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2650818 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2650819 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2650820 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty he said
2650821 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2650822 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2650823 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2650824 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2650825 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2650826 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2650827 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2650828 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2650829 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2650830 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2650831 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2650832 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2650833 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2650834 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2650835 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted

2650853 lower prices at the pump by increasing offshore drilling here at home
2650854 since being on board as coach i have made a number of changes to the national program for example we are playing more games together now and that is starting to give off results as the team is starting to gel
2650855 due to increasing levels of interest we have been able to set higher standards which have allowed us to name a well balanced team consisting of top line defence men a nice blend of big guys and vastly improved centre and forward lines that can move the ball forward quickly
2650856 for example i am very happy with the way champion brothers tasos and george dimacakos are playing along with the way danny zimmerman and danny mcullagh are shaping up
2650857 we also have a number of players that are improving their skills by playing in australia this year and i think we have improved significantly since last years win over the us revolution

2650869 hace un rato que no met a un gol se siente muy bien porque era el que nos pon a en el marcador pero m s all de eso me tiene contento que conseguimos la victoria ante un rival de grupo
2650870 la realidad es que este partido fue muy luchado en todos los sectores de la cancha es cierto que los balones cayeron en bal n parado pero tuvimos otras oportunidades en las que se pudo haber marcado pero no se pudo tuvimos variantes y por instantes manejamos bien el bal n

2650880 everyone you meet knows something you dont so politely and tactfully learn what it is conversely everyone you meet doesnt know everything you do so be willing to graciously share whatever you can when you are asked
2650881 no doubt about it i like to start and always have
2650882 ive gotten the opportunity and im trying to make the best of it
2650883 its obviously the biggest bat in our lineup rbi wise and it hurts
2650884 people joke and say man you must have thrown hard when you were younger my velocity is the same as its always been
2650885 i just had a couple of shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries and missed some time and broke a bone in my foot in 06 and last year i was in the bullpen i never really got the opportunity
2650886 i think we established the fastball early and kind of pounded the strike zone
2650887 they got aggressive there in the later innings and we started throwing some breaking balls and got some first pitch ground balls and pop ups there to help things out
2650888 not only pitching seven solid innings but getting a base hit and scoring a big run for us as well and using his legs to score a run big performance by him and good job by the bullpen to pull it out at the end
2650889 we have to suck it up and tighten our belts and go after it
2650890 i knew right away it was not going to be good
2650891 it hit me square its a bad deal but what can i do they said six to eight weeks so probably im out for the season unless the guys make a comeback and ill be back for the playoffs
2650892 i never felt this good in my career at the plate
2650893 i truly believe i was going to help make a comeback but now im out
2650894 it was a 2 2 count and he was trying to go up and in i couldnt get out of the way im a hitter that attacks the ball i dont wait back i saw it come and tried to get out of the way but it was coming in pretty good
2650895 losing a guy thats a teammate is hard but especially carlos hes a guy the last month or two has been carrying this team and were feeling like we have a chance now we lose one of the best hitters on the team and its hard
2650896 i feel sorry for him this year could have been one of his best to end it like this is not good
2650897 were going to continue to play hard and see if we can come back and stay in the race
2650898 when they do the spinning the dizzy bat race i think its funny
2650899 thats a good question weve got a couple reegies pretty funny im right up there too laughs
2650900 you dont think too much about that you just try to get better as much as you can just let the team decide where youre going you know theyre great players they deserve it but you keep working and they decide what youre going to do and where youre going to go you cant think about it too much
2650901 in venezuela where i lived the stadium was just in front of my apartment thats all my life baseball thats all ive got i never had toys like a normal kid i just had a ball and a glove the one thing i always remember is when my father would come to the house from work we would play some catch all night thats the best you know

2650904 i read david s article and i thought he had some interesting things to say but ultimately i m looking forward to gordon coming back from holiday refreshed batteries recharged and ready to carry on taking the decisions we need i m confident that he can show the bold leadership that we need i m sure david will enjoy his holiday and come back recharged and able to play his part in gordon s government
2650905 whether there is anything else behind what david said i haven t discussed with him but i think having said what he said it s probably just as well that he s enjoying himself on holiday and that has allowed the rest of us to get on with the day to day stuff of politics and taking on the tories

2650938 there are many americans in georgia training the military forces of the country and monitoring the situation as i understand they also supervise the strategic corridor the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline the main purpose behind the conflict is the further strategic orientation of georgia and an opportunity for the west i mean the usa and the eu to count on georgia and the caucasus in ensuring the strategic provision of oil

2650942 i would tell you that its a different way of building applications my prediction will be that web 3 0 will ultimately be seen as applications that are pieced together applications are relatively small data is in the cloud applications can run on any device very fast very customizable thats a very different application model than weve ever seen in computing likely to be very very large new generation of tools being announced

2650959 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2650960 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2650961 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2650962 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2650963 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2651030 danny freund i feel very much in control and i am a lot more confident this year and everything
2651031 we are home in the land of extreme here in philadelphia and ecw tonight has a blockbuster main event
2651032 yes we have a big 10 man tag team match as our main event as the dynasty covered in gold takes on the team of tommy dreamer hardcore holly al snow justin credible and rey mysterio i have my bets on the dynasty the most dominate force in professional wrestling history
2651033 joey its time you see the light and accept the fact that there is nothing better in ecw than the dynasty
2651034 at heat wave when they lose the rest of those belts they wont be so great
2651035 nice debut for shelton benjamin here in ecw and he will sure be a major player in the land of extreme
2651036 you know the dynasty might want to look into that kid he could come in handy later
2651037 oh man i cant wait until heat wave when the dynasty is knocked off that high horse they live up on
2651038 hold it what is with this 10 man tag team match i thought you had scheduled justin credible vs justin sane for tonights show
2651039 i did but that will happen at out for revenge now so tonight its a 10 man tag tonight will start the fall of the dynasty stephanie and at heat wave is will come to an end
2651040 the first official match made for augusts out for revenge ppv it will be justin sane vs justin credible
2651041 only room for one of them here in ecw and it will be justin sane i can almost guarantee you that joey
2651042 enough praise for the dynasty taz it is getting old
2651043 ok we both know john morrison is new to ecw but what is he doing helping out kid kash amp the miz
2651044 morrison knows how to surround himself with high profile people im sure he knows what he is doing or maybe he should look into joining the dynasty no more high profile than that
2651045 what will make you shut up about the dynasty already they are nothing but disrespectful snot nose brats
2651046 how dare you disrespect the greatest thing in wrestling today
2651047 hey you know all this crap going on with the dynasty is getting a little overboard your not worrying about anything else but them i want my rematch for the television championship
2651048 listen ok i think we can arrange that in 2 weeks here on ecw it shall be you vs saturn for the ecw television championship in a ladder match
2651049 wow a ladder match in 2 weeks for the television championship
2651050 i cant wait to see that but punk was right heyman needs to leave the dynasty alone
2651051 sandman is the welcome wagon here in ecw and psycho just shut him up fast this guy is impressive me
2651052 ok yeah hes impressive but lets give him some better competition like he wants
2651053 its time for our main event its a major 10 man tag team match with major impact reguarding a number of matches at heat wave
2651054 10 man tag team match more like the dynastys shooting range as they will pick up each man one at a time tonight
2651055 aipac and other jewish zionist lobbies who represent less than 2 of american people are using the united states through their mighty power in the news media financial institutions hollywood and entertainment industry both political parties congress and the white house as proxy to wage war against any country perceived to be threat to israel like in iraq

2651057 democratic breakthroughs and revolutions in five postcommunist countries comparative perspectives on the fourth wave
2651058 the inhabitants of abkhazia and south ossetia have been illegally granted russian citizenship and the russian state duma called in december 2006 for the unification of both enclaves with russia
2651059 putins lurch toward tsarism and neoimperialism why the united states should care
2651060 the most obvious target of neoimperialist action in putins recent rhetoric would of course be georgia where russia has long supported the secessionist territories abkhazia and south ossetia now russia could take one of many steps further it could step up the recent military aggression it could even recognize either territory in consort with belarus iran venezuela and similar anti western countries
2651061 and we will insist on this we would like such decisions to be worked out on the basis of general principles so as to exclude a situation in which proceeding from considerations of the so called political expediency it would be possible to use one set of approaches with respect to some countries and parts of europe say kosovo and quite different ones toward others for example in abkhazia or south ossetia
2651062 in the name of peacekeeping in places such as abkhazia south ossetia and trans dniestria restive regions within former soviet republics russia has sought to reestablish its tutelage and the west has largely not objected the west has done little to enable the soviet unions successor states with the exception of the baltic nations of estonia latvia and lithuania to achieve viable international standing the activities of russian troops in belarus georgia moldova ukraine and the former soviet states of central asia are rarely questioned let alone challenged moscow is treated as the de facto imperial center which is also how it conceives of itself
2651063 for example russia must not be permitted to use kosovos gaining its independence from serbia as a precedent for promoting secessionist movements in abkhazia nagorno karabakh south ossetia trans dniestria and most important crimea in an attempt to destabilize the national governments
2651064 georgia and the united states revealed in january that in early 2006 they had arrested a russian man attempting to sell 100 grams of weapons grade uranium the seizure was one of the largest of its kind and raised questions about the security of nuclear stockpiles in the region a joint georgian cia operation nabbed oleg khinsagov in tbilisi along with several georgian accomplices the sting was set up after georgian authorities discovered extensive smuggling operations in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia
2651065 a report from the field georgias war against contraband and its struggle for territorial integrity
2651066 saakashvilis reference to roki and psou two key border points between the breakaway republics and russia is significant it highlighted the concern that georgia will not be truly sovereign until it controls its borders with russia
2651067 on the front lines in the near abroad the cis and the osce in georgias civil wars
2651068 the case at hand the republic of georgia is a good one with which to test this possibility it involves efforts by a regional power with hegemonic aspirations russia to manage directly in the case of south ossetia and indirectly via a sub regional organisation two civil conflicts a broader regional organisation the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce is active in efforts to temper russian intervention in the south osset case the un is attempting to play a similar role with respect to abkhazia
2651069 russia has sought un approval for cis actions in georgia not least out of a desire to secure external finance for force deployment and the commonwealth of independent states peacekeeping force cispkf in abkhazia operates with the approval of the united nations security council as established by resolution 937 of 21 july 1994 there are however numerous instances in which such approval has not been sought for example the russian peacekeeping operation in south ossetia or has not been granted

2651136 the higher risk associated with vitamin d deficiency was particularly evident among individuals with high blood pressure
2651137 what hasnt been proven yet is that vitamin d deficiency actually causes increased risk of cardiovascular disease this would require a large randomized trial to show whether correcting the vitamin d deficiency would result in a reduction in cardiovascular risk

2651140 we have to suck it up and tighten our belts and go after it
2651141 i knew right away it was not going to be good
2651142 it hit me square its a bad deal but what can i do they said six to eight weeks so probably im out for the season unless the guys make a comeback and ill be back for the playoffs
2651143 i never felt this good in my career at the plate
2651144 i truly believe i was going to help make a comeback but now im out
2651145 it was a 2 2 count and he was trying to go up and in i couldnt get out of the way im a hitter that attacks the ball i dont wait back i saw it come and tried to get out of the way but it was coming in pretty good
2651146 losing a guy thats a teammate is hard but especially carlos hes a guy the last month or two has been carrying this team and were feeling like we have a chance now we lose one of the best hitters on the team and its hard
2651147 i feel sorry for him this year could have been one of his best to end it like this is not good
2651148 were going to continue to play hard and see if we can come back and stay in the race
2651149 no doubt about it i like to start and always have
2651150 ive gotten the opportunity and im trying to make the best of it
2651151 its obviously the biggest bat in our lineup rbi wise and it hurts
2651152 people joke and say man you must have thrown hard when you were younger my velocity is the same as its always been
2651153 i just had a couple of shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries and missed some time and broke a bone in my foot in 06 and last year i was in the bullpen i never really got the opportunity
2651154 i think we established the fastball early and kind of pounded the strike zone
2651155 they got aggressive there in the later innings and we started throwing some breaking balls and got some first pitch ground balls and pop ups there to help things out
2651156 not only pitching seven solid innings but getting a base hit and scoring a big run for us as well and using his legs to score a run big performance by him and good job by the bullpen to pull it out at the end
2651157 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
2651158 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
2651159 they both have the intellectual ability and the maturity to form judgments about important policy issues id feel comfortable with both of them in there as president
2651160 they are not people who are just preening for the cameras theyre both celebrities but theyre the rare breed celebrities who are actually interested in getting things done
2651161 he definitely has the ability to work with people of the other party but he also i felt showed a willingness not to give away the store which would have been my principal concern
2651162 i thought this is going to be a guy im going to enjoy working with over the years because he knows when to hold em and when to fold em
2651163 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
2651164 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
2651165 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
2651166 unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago
2651167 changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
2651168 he does seem much more tight and less fun than he was in the 2000 campaign i worry for his sake though im supporting his opponent that his handlers are constraining him too much
2651169 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
2651170 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
2651171 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
2651172 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent
2651173 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least
2651174 it wasnt my best stuff but it was important to get the win
2651175 he did a decent job even with the solo home runs he kept us in the game
2651176 youre starting to see that more hes relaxed for sure its easier for him to play now
2651177 even with three solo homers we still had a chance to get back into the game

2651188 the thujone content of old absinthe was about 0 26 g l 260 ppm 8 and 350 ppm when the thujyl alcohol from the wormwoods is included 3
2651189 this statement was made as an absolute without any safety valve and was not based upon actual testing of the very substance to which it referred old absinthe clearly one can see the potential precariousness of this statement we all assumed it to be correct as did i for many years but actual testing revealed something very different and continues to do so as for jad adams afaik he is a journalist not a scientific researcher i know of no scientific research analysis undertaken on his part i dont recall seeing anything in his writings that reflect the revelations of new research possibly because much of what he wrote iirc was done before the latest research i cannot stress how important it is to realize that anyone who has pubished writings and theories that are heavily dependent upon thujone for sensationalism would have reason to not want to accept all the latest revelations and some will undoubtedly refute that which contradicts their beliefs beyond a reasonable point this is simply human nature as for the rest of us we had our beliefs we tested our beliefs we admitted our beliefs were wrong we attempted to resolve the facts that make the truth what it is we adapted our thinking to accommodate the truth and moved on and on that note i can tell you there is more coming absinthist 1 i checked two original samples of b 65 for glycyrrhizinic residues some years ago with interesting results the analytical data from my original samples concurs precisely with the written protocol from an original distillers notes that came to me from switzerland some time later 2 the wine spirits i use are indeed expensive and in short supply but i wanted something distilled using the appropriate varietals and to my exacting standards in the interest of being as historically correct as possible you can take comfort in the fact that the spirits i use exhibit a methanol content that is well within the contemporary health standards

2651205 im 50 years old married to trinity and i call myself a cincinnati expat living in seattle ive been here 19 years two adult children 30 and 32 my daughter really likes absinthe but my son doesnt care for it eew licorice i worked briefly in the food industry through the late 80s and early 90s cooking in a series of caf s and trattorias ive considered opening a caf but i decided id rather cook at home
2651206 aside from absinthe i love good whisky i was a scotch and gin man for years until i became interested in classic cocktails i still like scotch but now its mostly bourbon and rye my favorite cocktails are the sazerac ramos gin fizz theda bara obituary gin amp tonic dry martini and a bourbon amp ginger ale highball
2651207 the society was first announced on january 6th 2004 we had our first event just over three years ago march 13 2004 the online forum started later that year
2651208 the reason i founded the wormwood society is simple i wanted to be able to have absinthe parties and associate with others who have an appreciation for absinthe both experienced and novice alike it was a purely selfish gesture really it also has the added benefit of being instrumental in spreading absinthe culture and giving people an opportunity to explore their interest in this unique beverage further than they might do on their own
2651209 the wormwood society started as a casual local seattle absinthe club as interest grew and after many requests the doors of the previously private discussion forum were opened to an international audience soon it became apparent that there was a need for an organization with an independent voice which could help educate consumers guide them in their absinthe choices and help them avoid unscrupulous profiteers in a new industry
2651210 well the wormwood society is an actual organization intended to bring people together at real life events so in that respect wormwood society isnt just a forum its an organization with a forum
2651211 i dont drink it for the flavor i drink it for the effects
2651212 the forum has gotten a much needed facelift and has had one or two new areas added but otherwise itll stay pretty much the same
2651213 of course people come and go but we currently have around 800 members about half of which have been active at some point with the rest just lurking and an active core group of around 70 members our active member ratio is pretty good most of us are in the us but we have members all over the world the internet is handy that way diversity has been important to me from the beginning since i have a pretty diverse background myself you name it we have it ages from 21 to upwards of 60 all sexual gender orientations many ethnicities and religions conservatives liberals old hippies young rappers and all points on the economic spectrum well to be fair not all points you pretty much need to have a computer
2651214 oh jeez i remember at one point mentioning that id met 30 of them but i think that was when there were only 150 or so as of right now ive met 185 of our members and i expect to be meeting a few more in the coming months as many as a dozen or so
2651215 a year or so ago i said i thought legalization would be within the next five years now im really excited i really hope this flies
2651216 when it comes to bureaucracy public safety is no match for economics if theres revenue to be had you can bet the government agencies will acknowledge what weve known for years absinthe isnt any more harmful than gin and theres no reason it shouldnt be available on the us market
2651217 i think the market will stay pretty much the way it is only bigger the us has strict labeling and marketing laws about alcohol so many of the eastern european distributors will have to adjust their marketing vectors substantially i do think the up market space will expand quite a bit but that will happen globally anyway as good as the current top shelf absinthes are right now theyre only going to keep getting better with more and more new brands appearing all the time what a wonderful thing to look forward to
2651218 one correction as far as i know since the people who have made the big statements are keeping the actual information secret legalization is still quite needed the most recent twist is just a loophole in red tape a number of things still need to be changed like the actual regulations and perhaps even a good legal definition of absinthe hopefully all of that is coming in the future the funny thing is that while the us appears behind the times in absinthe regulations we are sitting at the right point in the revival to get it right from the beginning unlike europe which was is swamped with fake products
2651219 the opinions expressed here are purely personal and do not necessarily reflect the views of absinthe suisse com or associated companies
2651220 in short ive no problem with czech absinthe ive a problem with the dishonest way much of it is marketed
2651221 one scientist trying to work out what absinthe did to the french who by 1910 were drinking 36 million litres a year calculates that the amount of thujone per glass was and is so small you would likely fall off your chair before hallucinating
2651222 yes we make the best czech absinth actually the only authentic absinthe from the czech republic
2651223 the opinions expressed here are purely personal and do not necessarily reflect the views of absinthe suisse com or associated companies
2651224 reading further it appears that i run the risk of being sued if i use a picture of logan fils without using nice editorial
2651225 logan fils la blanche is made according to the old traditional recipe that was acquired in switzerland from the region of val de travers where absinthe was invented swiss la bleue is distilled from carefully selected herbs and made from eau de vie distilled from selected wine it comes crystal clear in the bottle and turns milky when ice cubes are added our swiss la bleue is carefully balanced as to its taste and is just slightly bitter
2651226 originally based on a swiss recipe this czech absinthe has no artificial color or preservatives and contains 100mg of the psychoactive thujone adored by some of the worlds most notorious artists and writers van gogh picasso hemingway bob dylan marilyn manson and eminem are just a few who used and drew inspiration from this original absinthe and its effects

2651236 the most amazing quality of this verte suisse is its mouth feel truly like nothing ive drank before louche is beautiful perfect great with sugar sweet bitter and very aromatic angelique is my new favorite even my friends preferred it when i let them sample my absinthes their first time
2651237 i thought the angelique was terrific it was well balanced with just the right amount of wormwood
2651238 i want to congratulate claude alain on the ang lique its wonderful i hope itll be going into full production soon so that i can rave about it on the forum its definitely my favorite verte of the ones ive tried so far superceding the jades which constitute my only reference if artemisia is aiming for a monopoly well youre quite close to having one in my book i think im going to start telling my friends absinthe is a swiss beverage
2651239 i will treat the description of this bottle as though it were made just for me because it is that good the graphic designer has gone above and beyond with the label it is beautiful and captures a mood that is befitting such an amazing recipe as this it must have been the fairies that contributed to the herb selection and balance because it could only be through magic or an extremely sensitive pallet that this combination could have been perfected the smell as the bottle is opened the first time is strong and reeks of the essence of absinthe as it ought to be the louche is perfect and beautiful as it is difficult to determine the rations the first time an absinthe is mixed i used the method i always use i slowly drip the spring water from my fountain until it is entirely opaque only then do i stop and i stop exactly then i suggest smelling this with your eyes closed to see what the smell evokes as i did it is olfactory perfection the taste of this absinthe is just as absinthe was meant to be it accomplishes what many other absinthes are obviously trying to accomplish it is a refined combination that makes no attempts at being overly complex just to stand out the subtle tincture of background herbs dances around the dominant flavors in such a way that there is no competition it is drinking a bottle of harmony the mouth feel of this absinthe has just the right amount of bite even when diluted i can feel it working as the flavor passes over my tongue the aftertaste of this fine mixture is of strong anise i have grown to adore anise over the last several years of drinking absinthe so it is as though it is still in my mouth long after i have lamentable pleasure of swallowing my last sip i am greatly pleased that claude alan has turned his expertise to the absinthes verte as they have always been my favorites thank you for the pleasure i have had this evening

2651274 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2651275 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2651276 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2651277 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2651286 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2651290 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2651291 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2651292 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2651293 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2651294 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2651295 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2651296 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2651297 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2651298 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2651299 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2651300 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2651301 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2651302 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2651303 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2651304 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2651305 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2651306 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2651307 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2651308 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2651309 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2651310 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2651311 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2651312 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2651313 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2651314 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2651315 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2651316 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2651317 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2651318 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2651319 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2651320 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2651321 who are open to doing something on the production side
2651322 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2651323 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2651324 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2651325 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2651326 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2651327 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2651328 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2651329 ive been hanging out with some people from bootcamp and they are cool and stuff but not really into any shit i am
2651330 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2651331 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2651332 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2651333 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2651334 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2651335 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2651336 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2651337 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2651338 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2651339 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2651340 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2651341 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2651342 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2651343 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2651344 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2651345 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2651346 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2651347 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2651348 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2651349 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2651350 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2651351 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2651352 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2651353 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2651354 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2651355 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2651356 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2651357 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2651358 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2651359 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2651360 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2651361 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2651362 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2651363 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2651364 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2651365 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2651366 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2651367 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2651368 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2651369 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2651370 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2651371 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2651372 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2651373 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2651374 but im not sure how skilled any of prot g s may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2651375 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2651376 year after year power root has its broken records in terms of total prize money
2651377 oh say can you see by the dawns early light
2651378 whose broad stripes and bright stars thro the perilous fight
2651379 i could have been somebody instead of a bum which is what i am
2651380 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2651381 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2651382 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2651383 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2651384 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2651385 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2651386 we can disagree on issues without trying to tear down the other persons reputation or attack his character
2651387 this is a person who has engaged and energized millions of americans who had never been engaged in the political process
2651388 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2651389 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2651390 people are very attached to their animals i hope you appreciate that
2651391 when you get the chance ping him for his contact information
2651392 we did a deep dive of that telecom company but we still need to drill down on their margins
2651393 rioters hang another negro mobs in springfield ill defying 3 000 soldiers string up old and innocent victim
2651394 mass deaths and place at risk the continuity of the operations of the united states government
2651395 given the danger to the safety of the united states
2651396 it is not practicable to apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts
2651397 the continuity of the operations of the united states government
2651398 nothing comes from nothing nothing ever could so somewhere in my youth or childhood i must have done something good
2651399 we hear it at weddings at the super bowl big bad voodoo daddy in 1999 with the brian setzer orchestra its a great american fusion that crosses genders cultures and generations
2651400 we think of ourselves as a theater not a dinner theater
2651401 i have three children of my own and none of them are alike
2651402 ill go back and reflect on that i might have students reading at the second or third grade level like my oldest or students who have never picked up a book or never been read to i have the parental perspective not to make judgments about parents as well i know what i went through as a single mom
2651403 theyll ask questions of themselves can i make it to the end of the week am i really supposed to do this
2651404 when they student taught they had a foot in the classroom so its not a totally brand new experience for them
2651405 but this is totally their classroom for the first time
2651406 i remember working a lot of hours on the curriculum side and learning how to manage children
2651407 we need to step back get enough sleep rest find some wonderful things that you enjoy doing
2651408 its easy to come back nights and weekends and stay up until midnight working on something i always felt i could move a cot into my classroom be there 24 7 and it still wouldnt be done
2651409 i feel too nervous to not be doing anything now
2651410 since im a new teacher theyre going to ask me a lot of questions im a young teacher
2651411 we did some good things out there today but we still have a lot to improve on

2651413 its a short drive but a big change in scenery
2651414 weve benefitted from the economy and high fuel prices in the sense that in state becomes a very big market for us
2651415 weve even noticed a lot of sarasota people taking a vacation with us
2651416 there arent many great sunsets over the water in orlando
2651417 if you are living out by i 75 and you do a vacation on longboat key its like you are in a different place
2651418 why drive to naples or west palm beach when you can be on the beach in a half hour
2651419 the florida market which is the drive market is pretty strong
2651420 particularly along the gulf coast the summer has been better than expected
2651421 no matter where you go the close by market is feeding the destination
2651422 it should be great for local economies because they are still spending money but they are just spending it closer to home
2651423 we started going after the state market a few years ago when people hardly had the time for a vacation
2651424 now you add on gas prices and the misery that is air travel right now
2651425 gas is 4 a gallon but there is an appeal to just piling everyone in the car and just going to the beach
2651426 ive talked to some small hoteliers who didnt do so well last year who are doing very well
2651427 the hoteliers are covered up with people from lakewood ranch and they are loving it
2651428 were finding more people coming in from the east coast
2651429 we had the best july ever and the island is up overall
2651430 the gas crisis and the weak economy is keeping people closer to home
2651431 were listening to as many people as we can to try to get more ideas about how we can help spur on floridas economy
2651432 were listening and learning from them and i think thats important to do every day
2651433 empty chair charlie is so out of touch with florida he does not even get why he is out of touch
2651434 in this time of economic uncertainty floridians want real leadership and concrete ideas on how to end the republican recession not photo ops and publicity stunts
2651435 at a minimum bush could tell floridians correctly that he was doing what he could recognizing that governors have a very small role in directing the states economy
2651436 charlies in a tougher spot because there is no discretionary money i think the real issue is not the listening tour but is it a hearing tour what is charlie learning from all this or is it just a series of nice photo ops and another attempt to impress the mccain people that he is vp stuff
2651437 the public has to believe the governor feels what they feel and cares what they care
2651438 when katrina is there youve got to be on the ground
2651439 youve got to have the smell of the flood in your shirt is that symbolic it sure as hell is but its very important to show that youre concerned because for the floridian and the voter that makes that difference
2651440 i dont know what the european trip was all about except maybe a pre honeymoon and to try to act like he is trying to drum up business
2651441 2 245 high tech jobs in floridas aviation aerospace and defense industries
2651442 i think that so far theres not been much talk about the people affected by the buyout
2651443 i definitely think that there could have been a better outreach
2651444 you cant say were going to pass a law that is going to fix everything
2651445 symbolism matters a lot in politics its important that people know their elected officials are paying attention
2651446 i am trying to work as hard as i can so that i dont have to worry about competition
2651447 you work hard enough but they still dont have a spot for you because money is tight for the university
2651448 we have almost 500 freshman applications already for next year
2651449 students need to apply early and they need to do their homework early to have a fighting chance
2651450 they all know what happened to their friends last year that it was very difficult to get into the state universities
2651451 it just makes me want to work harder on applications so i feel better about it
2651452 if it was like october i would be in a panic
2651453 i really dont know that much about him but the only thing i do know about him was he was a very hard worker
2651454 he worked landscape in the daytime and worked in a restaurant at night i really dont think that it was drug related or anything like that
2651455 each of them came to me and said no we want our name on that treasurers report
2651456 we can tell who modified a file who printed it who sent it who created it
2651457 if we get someones hard drive we know their soul
2651458 there is a large group and we cant tell you why
2651459 the cia retired group is so large that theyre split into three regional groups for reunions
2651460 sensitive background investigations for the fbi white house congress department of justice and other governmental entities
2651461 we can tell who modified a file who printed it who sent it who created it
2651462 they ended up reporting the parents to dcf without talking to them about it
2651463 can you imagine having dcf show up at your house and ask you if youre a child molester its been very difficult for that family
2651464 under the advice of legal counsel we will make no comment at this time
2651465 we feel good there are several major retailers who have shown interest in the site
2651466 products from mouth blown glass have the signs of old handcraft art and
2651467 mistakes are now so common that academics should simply accept them as variants
2651468 all the data suggests that there are more and more students at university level whose spelling is not up to scratch universities are even finding they have masters level students who cannot spell
2651469 janganlah kalian banyak makan nanti banyak minum dan akhirnya banyak tidur
2651470 sesungguhnya allah berfirman wahai anak adam beribadahlah sepenuhnya kepadaku niscaya aku penuhi hatimu yang ada di dalam dada dengan kekayaan dan aku penuhi kebutuhanmu jika tidak kalian lakukan nis caya aku penuhi tanganmu dengan kesibukan dan tidak aku penuhi kebutuhanmu kepada manusia
2651471 tuhan kalian berkata wahai anak adam beribadah lah kepadaku sepenuhnya niscaya aku penuhi hatimu dengan kekayaan dan aku penuhi kedua tanganmu dengan rizki wahai anak adam jangan jauhi aku sehingga aku penuhi hatimu dengan kefakiran dan aku penuhi kedua tangamu dengan kesibukan
2651472 like many of the people i had read about i set out on a long journey to find truth and beauty as usual the road led straight back to the beginning home country roads the sun setting through the woods
2651473 we are nearer today to the ideal of the abolition of poverty and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land
2651474 i read a writers almanac on the internet every morning and am very grateful to be able to do so
2651475 about time i paid for listening to and reading the writers almanac besides i could do with another mug
2651476 i read the writers almanac every single day send bits of it to friends save quotes in my archives i am inspired by the struggles of people of the past and adore hearing the historical truth behind the legends of the great and the unsung it has become part of the days beginning
2651477 my husband and i enjoy reading the writers almanac daily and value what it adds to our lives
2651478 i love the writers almanac and garrison keillor although im at work and dont get to hear garrisons voice every day i receive the e mail versions so that 5 minutes is an essential part of my daily life
2651479 as a writer ive enjoyed the writers almanac as a source of inspiration and enlightenment for years
2651480 writers almanac is one the best things in my inbox
2651481 i love my daily writers almanac email i appreciate the quirky interesting literary and historical facts and the wide range of poetry presented over time i have genuinely increased my knowledge of literature
2651482 adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories
2651483 the rights of the indigenous people need to be safeguarded they need to be given priority and assisted so that they will not be left out from the development mainstream
2651484 impact of laws and government policies to the indigenous peoples in sabah
2651485 it is important for the state government to look into and address the issues or problems faced the indigenous people like those related to land matters which were brought up during the seminar
2651486 being part of the indigenous community i am also proud of the increasing recognition given to indigenous people
2651487 the government as we have seen has made many changes in its effort to develop the country the state and the people
2651488 do we want to leave behind all that we have inherited from our elders
2651489 its something weve all paid into so it should be there if you are in need of it
2651490 the system you have to work with is a nightmare
2651491 they want to make it as complicated as possible so that we give up or die trying
2651492 youre caught in a time warp still in the middle of an appeal tearing your hair out your conditions worsening and youre staring death in the face this is the epitome of helplessness
2651493 they just kind of stand there and watch you suffer
2651494 the point is there are animals that cant be placed in the community
2651495 if we had the humane societys budget we the twin cities could literally be no kill tomorrow
2651496 theres a level of dysfunction in animal welfare in the twin cities
2651497 its not productive in forming trusting strong relationships and in the long term it derails the focus in helping animals and only fuels the feeling of divisiveness in the community
2651498 animals that are seriously ill or aggressive are humanely euthanized unfortunately in 2007 14 610 animals were euthanized because of behavioral and health issues or by the owners request
2651499 then you know its a vet making a medical decision for the pet and the best interest of the pet is kept in mind

2651537 now brothers i know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders but this is how god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets saying that his christ would suffer repent then and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out that times of refreshing may come from the lord and that he may send the christ who has been appointed for you even jesus he must remain in heaven until the time comes for god to restore everything as he promised long ago through his holy prophets

2651606 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2651607 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2651608 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2651609 it was spectacular yesterday was meant to be a quiet day for the bush family with president bush scheduled to watch the games the forbidden city visit the first ladys second trip to the expansive former palace was the only publicly announced event on her daily schedule
2651610 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2651611 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2651612 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2651613 you have lot of gods it is very confusing we have only one god who takes care of all of us
2651614 hinduism is a very organised religion even gods have specific individual tasks to perform there is one god to protect one to create and one to destroy these three are like the ceo cfo and chief of sales in a corporation your religion which is worshipping one lord is like a proprietorship firm
2651615 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2651616 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2651617 we wanted to bring heat to the burbs something that people havent seen around here because were the closest store in the burbs to inner city boutiques we carry anything from sbs jordans air force 1s air maxes converse and there are a lot of other new products that we plan on carrying in the future
2651618 my friends i had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time
2651619 if when you say whiskey you mean the devils brew the poison scourge the bloody monster that defiles innocence dethrones reason destroys the home creates misery and poverty yea literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children if you mean the evil drink that topples the christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation and despair and shame and helplessness and hopelessness then certainly i am against it
2651620 but if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation the philosophic wine the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes if you mean christmas cheer if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentlemans step on a frosty crispy morning if you mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy and his happiness and to forget if only for a little while lifes great tragedies and heartaches and sorrows if you mean that drink the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children our blind our deaf our dumb our pitiful aged and infirm to build highways and hospitals and schools then certainly i am for it
2651621 this is my stand i will not retreat from it i will not compromise
2651622 mesmo n o participando dos jogos vou levar as medalhas
2651623 the use of a political poster during an election or referendum campaign is a matter of freedom of speech and any attempt to curb the already restricted use of political postering would be an attack on democracy
2651624 the idea of limiting the number of posters to a candidate is ridiculous as it does not take into account geography or situation
2651625 i have no problem with using biodegradable poster materials or requiring recycling of posters or maximum sizes of posters and i would welcome local authorities in exercising their already sufficient existing powers in relation to posters and cable ties
2651626 i think the situation as it stands is a close to ideal and would like to stress that the right of politicians to poster is a historical and democratic right as well as an expression of freedom of speech and thought and any attempts to reign it in will be opposed vigorously by those of use who put our names on the ballot paper and our faces on posters in an effort to make a change for the better in our local area
2651627 i think minister gormely is using the issues of posters as an exercise in public relations among those people in his own constituency who think of political posters as litter rather than as a freedom of expression of thoughts and ideas

2651636 well hmm i dont know what the designer meant by this

2651662 another tradition to politics a tradition that stretched from the days of the countrys founding to the glory of the civil rights movement a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart
2651663 i told them they were right government couldnt solve all their problems
2651664 thats the topic of this book how we might begin the process of changing our politics and our civic life this isnt to say that i know exactly how to do it i dont
2651665 chapter three explores the constitution not just as a source of individual rights but also as a means of organizing a democratic conversation around our collective future
2651666 in chapter four i try to convey some of the institutional forces money media interest groups and the legislative process that stifle even the best intentioned politician
2651667 but that is not all that i am i also think my party can be smug detached and dogmatic at times

2651671 not every american may be able to recite them few if asked could trace the genesis of the declaration of independence to its roots in eighteenth century liberal and republican thought

2651715 looks like it was an easy game for russia but it was not that way
2651716 it is a 54 hole tournament and i wont do anything tomorrow that i havent done the past couple of days
2651717 i stuck to the game plan of picking the right club to hit the fairways and leaving myself 15 footers im happy with todays round because i got off to a shaky start
2651718 i was very fortunate to come off the 18th green which was my ninth hole at even par
2651719 at 6 under i feel pretty good my goal is to get to double digits 10 or 11 under if im standing here tomorrow at 10 under i feel pretty comfortable saying there will be a fourth title
2651720 i played a real good front nine which was my back nine
2651721 because of the wind and the greens firming up the course played about two strokes more difficult today
2651722 im extremely pleased ive played beyond my expectations so far
2651723 im playing good im putting good i just want to keep calm and relaxed for tomorrow
2651724 i have never really been in this position at this tournament before
2651725 i have won a few things but nothing of this magnitude this is the biggest event in the state we are battling against the pros and the best players from all over
2651726 i made a couple of putts and managed to sneak in with a 72 instead of a 74 or 75

2651775 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2651776 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2651777 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2651778 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2651779 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2651780 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2651781 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2651782 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2651783 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2651784 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2651785 we got her away from him before it got worse
2651786 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2651787 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2651788 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury

2651814 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
2651815 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

2651829 i had been squaring it up pretty well all day so i wasnt really nervous
2651830 with the defiance of the milf 105th base command to pull out from illegally occupied areas in north cotabato the group has degenerated into a plain bandit group and considered as lost command
2651831 as such today sunday the government forces launched clearing operations in certain barangay in north cotabato as a due course for law enforcement without necessarily being constrained by the ceasefire agreement
2651832 right now the joint ceasefire committee is thrashing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is threshed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire
2651833 it would be nice to find a starbucks to go to close by
2651834 success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which one has overcome while trying to succeed
2651835 not anymore though its the same thing with ron people hear stuff about ron and think im not going near ron people hear about queensbridge and say im not going out there but when you get out there like i said about ron when you actually get to know him its different its a great place same with him hes a great person theyre going to love him in houston
2651836 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture
2651837 i lived in a ghetto but am i ghetto is ron ghetto he was born and raised in the projects but he never got involved with all the negative stuff
2651838 it was not far from him but the way he was raised the house was one thing and what happened in the streets was another thing there were guns some bullets came into the house twice i found the bullet holes
2651839 he never was in trouble in queensbridge the neighborhood is rough people did what they did that doesnt mean you have to get caught up with it i dont drink i dont smoke it was never a temptation for me the type of person ron is the way he grew up i dont think the stuff outside affected him
2651840 as long as it wasnt raining so hard you couldnt see ron and his father would be at queensbridge shooting hoops it could be snowing his father would shovel and his little brother would be rebounding feeding him the ball
2651841 people dont know how hard ron worked to get where he is right now
2651842 they think he is this loose cannon guy goes to the beat of his own drum and doesnt pay attention to the rules youve heard all these things its really not true ron where he came from to get to the nba is a dramatic story
2651843 ron was on his own a lot he was a soldier he could have quit many times but he had it in his heart he knew basketball was going to be his out
2651844 the image that he has to me hes not like that at all
2651845 he brought most of the baggage on himself but he has a pure heart hes not a bad guy
2651846 i was into basketball i was in vietnam i was very against drugs in the community thats how this started i fought the drug dealers i go to mass every day i tried to pull ron closer to god and he was ron will give you the shirt off his back hes a great human being i kept ron going to church every day i believed if he gets closer to god i dont have to worry about him
2651847 now hes married hes a great father always doing something with his children always giving back to his community
2651848 it drives him he is proud not of getting out of queensbridge but of being from there his body might have left but his mind and his heart are still there
2651849 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him
2651850 i wanted to be technical and i think i was able to do that
2651851 human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
2651852 which one is tianna recardo asked i shly raise my hand then noticed i was extremely wet and
2651853 one must always be mindful just like you might forget that old girlfriend who tried to slit your throat but shes really still hot if you remember the stitches more than you remember the pussy youre going to be just fine
2651854 if you look at what you have in life you will always have more if you look at what you do not have in life you will never have enough
2651855 i just go out there and do what i can i dont have any ties to that spot by any means he can have it
2651856 hes put in a lot of time hes been working hard
2651857 its starting to pay off hopefully he keeps it going
2651858 thats the biggest thing relax and be on time be ready to hit just contribute to the team regardless of whether im in the lineup if im contributing wherever its not only going to help the team its going to help get us going
2651859 i saw early on that he was standing way back even on my first serve so that opened up the serve and volley a bit more
2651860 from the baseline when i am hitting my short forehand well and coming in it makes my volley look a lot better so i think i did that well
2651861 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2651862 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2651863 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2651864 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2651865 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom

2651879 this is the first time weve met in three years and weve played doubles together for the last five years
2651880 the kids in college now are making it harder to get to the finals
2651881 im not ever thinking about matt until we get through these quarters and semis you just have to go for your shots and hope youre hitting
2651882 i had to work the point and work my opportunities however in the second set he really changed his style he started pressing me a little bit harder he started coming to the net and put pressure on me he usually stays back on the baseline im usually the one putting the pressure on but he started doing that before i could its a different style so i had to adjust a little bit but it worked out in the end
2651883 ive been trying to work on that trying to be a little more aggressive and not let him dictate in previous years that ive played him hes very aggressive and once he gets in to the net theres not much i can do
2651884 if i had gotten a few more first serves in maybe i could have held that last game
2651885 a lot of the younger kids are hungry and those who we teach are starting to pressure us i just got through jessie hutchinson 6 2 4 6 6 2 in the semis i was happy to get through there
2651886 i was happy to give scott a tough match today i thought i played pretty well but in the end he just came up with the bigger shots at the big times hes a tough opponent at least i have him as my doubles partner
2651887 gt bloomfields amanda moreland gets in an early morning run at mendon ponds park last week
2651888 ive been on the varsity team since eighth grade and have learned you need to run everyday during the summer
2651889 cross country isnt like most sports where you can just show up at the first day of practice if you dont dedicate yourself to the sport youre going to feel it everywhere in your body
2651890 quite often people come out for the sport for casual reasons which is fine but they end up finding themselves in trouble because just three weeks of running before your first meet isnt enough
2651891 i dedicate about 65 percent of my summer to running
2651892 ive been training six days a week this entire summer
2651893 in addition to my 35 or more miles per week running i swim and hike
2651894 but i feel that placing in the top five is in my reach
2651895 getting the mental mindset to run a long distance at a strong pace is hard
2651896 after two miles you just have to hold on and fight cramps its a struggle to move your arms and power through the ups and downs of the course
2651897 whats so great about this sport is that everyone gets to play and not have to worry about playing time
2651898 these guys dont get the same glory as other sports because there are no stands for people to sit in and watch
2651899 but my athletes have told me how their friends on other sports teams talk of how much running we do
2651900 i tried out for the soccer team in my freshman year and was cut
2651901 it turned out to be the best thing that has ever happened to me cross country is so hard which makes it so rewarding people always think they cant do it i try to tell them that it is easier than it looks which is a lie but most people are still afraid of the pain they might endure
2651902 having to run three miles as hard as you can is no walk in the park
2651903 one of the worst meets ive seen was in st lawrence when it was hailing
2651904 the mud was up to the athletes shins but its like a right of passage for them they take the mud and smear it on their faces
2651905 one of my athletes she was new asked if the meet was going to be canceled
2651906 the veterans just looked at her and laughed and informed her that cross country runs in all weather
2651907 in 2000 we had a meet in auburn with a hill you couldnt even run up
2651908 there was also a meet in weedsport about two years ago with a hill so steep kids were sloshing sliding and slipping all over
2651909 most people that come to our course dread running the hill especially when conditions are poor
2651910 a lot of people have to walk up it because there isnt any traction
2651911 the weather is the most fun part the colder the better i love running in the rain wind and mud its too bad that we cant make cross country more like it is in europe with the obstacles
2651912 when its colder out you have to use more mental energy which makes it more rewarding to persevere
2651913 probably the worst meet ive ever run in was my sophomore year at flcc for the league championship flcc was basically washed out and you could barely make it up the hill
2651914 even though your chest feels like its going to explode and your legs feel like cement it is a very rewarding feeling
2651915 the sport in general is actually very fun and the feeling of being successful after a race is so great
2651916 i wanted to come back and play again after quite a few years being away it was fun and it was great to be able to win again
2651917 there are more 13 year olds on the womens professional tour than 30 year olds
2651918 i really didnt think that i had it in the bag i teach a few 13 year olds quinn is the best in high school and she beats out everybody else including college girls
2651919 shes a tough player i knew her game pretty well you have to put the ball away otherwise it comes back ive seen her play before so i was prepared for a lot of balls to come back shes not going to give me anything she really does not give many points away she slices the ball extremely well and places the ball incredibly well on the court very close to the line shes an excellent counter puncher she uses the angles very well
2651920 i played a pretty clean match did not commit a lot of errors
2651921 the rest of my game is a lot more up to date than my serve i felt like it was going to get better as i play we both had to serve pretty well its clay so you dont get a lot of aces its a slow surface
2651922 i felt like i controlled most points throughout the match it was just a matter of me finally getting control and hitting a few more winners
2651923 ive been coaching at the u of r the last eight years this is my fourth time winning this it was good to be back in doubles and singles
2651924 the first year in i was hoping to get a few games in but i made the final
2651925 olsen r en striker som kommer att g ra fler m l f r dem
2651926 when its so close to your head you dont know whats going on
2651927 if it was intentional i was hoping for the ribs or lower we scored five runs after that whatever it did was a good thing for us
2651928 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
2651929 since yesterday i thought we would leave the games the russian political leaders our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this
2651930 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2651931 we just need to keep fighting and see if we can come out of it the plan is to come out tomorrow and be the best we can be we were scoring runs in bunches but now its not happening but were not panicking
2651932 the kind of offensive production we got from the top of the lineup is going to go a long way for you
2651933 i just went out there and tried to focus on the mitt as much as possible and keep my mind down in the zone i came in here knowing that they were probably going to take pitches on me because im a rookie coming into a big stadium so i really tried to pound the zone
2651934 thats the best ive seen him throw since he got up here
2651935 as the game went on he got a little swagger going he commanded all his pitches it was a huge game for his confidence
2651936 its difficult to get a mass audience for short films via the film festival route
2651937 typically a short film has quite a short life if youre lucky a year or two

2651939 its important to be able to enable others by helping them finance their next project

2651964 this definitely gives you peace of mind happiness and the confidence that the team has confidence in you i hope im going to be an eagle for the rest of my career
2651965 the last time we did a contract right before a game in preseason was the hall of fame game in canton ohio in 2006 when we signed safety brian dawkins to a two year extension
2651966 we think of him as a hall of fame caliber player and i feel like im standing up again right before a preseason game talking about a hall of fame caliber player
2651967 westbrook is a premier guy leader and player he just just wants to win so badly he wants the team to be the best it can be if you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2651968 everything ive ever seen is in this deal i really have to credit brian and his agent todd france they really hung in there there was never any threat of westbrook leaving training camp or holding out
2651969 we dont sit here with a bunch of hard and fast rules so we have some flexibility that allows us to be both reasonable and aggressive

2651971 i know its only preseason but it was still my first nfl game
2651972 just being in a stadium that size was a pretty neat feeling i think it helped that i didnt play until the fourth quarter because i had time to soak it all in when my number was finally called i was able to just play football
2651973 the biggest thing for me was that i gained experience the more experience i get the more comfortable ill be
2651974 i was a little disappointed on the punt returns but the guys on the other team get paid too every time im back there i want to take it to the house score a touchdown but i just have to be patient
2651975 my girlfriend my college roommate and a couple of other buddies from wheaton came too
2651976 and theyre all starting back to illinois in a few minutes but im glad they came it meant a lot to me for them to be here for this
2651977 this has done more not just for our health but its been beneficial to our total outlook about life even the friendships weve made have been beneficial
2651978 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
2651979 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
2651980 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
2651981 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
2651982 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
2651983 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
2651984 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
2651985 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
2651986 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
2651987 i met up with some guys up there who showed me around i had a swell time but sure am glad to get back to this old campus hope i get to go somewhere else sometime
2651988 it was a tremendous thrill for a depression farm boy who had barely been out of the state
2651989 knocking hoot owls out of the trees in his back yard when they kept him awake nights down in mcculloch county and it is a likely story when you realize that he comes from a section so wild that he used to shoot turkeys from the back door
2651990 they brought me back to hardin simmons made me give up football and let me practice the javelin in the daytime
2651991 i had rather work my problems out without a coach but working out alone surely gets monotonous
2651992 there was no expense money from my family or from my college which had no track team or track coach
2651993 on my first throw i got down to the head of the runway and was all ready to go and the official stepped out and told me to stop
2651994 he said it was very interesting and different i have a few things of his an olympic belt buckle a sash an olympic patch an old javelin and a few medals but he had his things stored in a warehouse in san angelo that burned in 1940 or 1941
2651995 when he didnt bring home a medal he said thats it
2651996 he stayed busy his whole life he never got fat and he didnt have any vices he just wore out and he was a hell of a fisherman we fished nearly every weekend while i was growing up
2651997 all we were allowed was a dollar a week for laundry
2651998 it wasnt really sufficient so we all ended up kind of in debt when the thing was over
2651999 with the right kind of coaching and training schedule i believe i could have really hung up some records for them to shoot at
2652000 the clerk in the grocery store forgot to put the milk in the bag and now i have to go back and nobody does it right and nobody ever takes care of me and this always happens to me
2652001 ugh the milks not here how irritating but wait maybe theres something for me in the drive back to the store maybe it will give me the time i have been needing to take a breath maybe it will teach me that i can create fifteen minutes in my day just for me next time ill see if i can do it without the double milk run
2652002 show me a greater point of view a point of view stronger than my doubt greater than my anger fairer than my judgment i am not that which has happened to me show me the point of view of love and how i can recognize and be healed by it in the midst of my chaos

2652023 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2652024 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2652025 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2652026 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2652027 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2652028 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2652029 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
2652030 i chose to love you in silence for in silence i find no rejection i chose to love you in your loneliness for in your loneliness no one owns you but me
2652031 if the people we love are stolen from us the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them
2652032 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2652033 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2652034 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2652035 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2652036 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2652037 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
2652038 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through

2652068 the executive board took the decision this morning to declare ms thanou ineligible to compete in the beijing games and the executive board also took the decision in their own right to send a firm signal of the moral case that this has brought the olympic movement into disrepute
2652069 these events resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the olympic movement and the ioc into disrepute
2652070 right now i see in him that hes not thinking about anything
2652071 hes having fun and good things are happening for him
2652072 hey this is what you do and this is how you do it
2652073 i feel very good about the way he is swinging the bat
2652074 hes emerging as one of those solid solid solid leadership guys in the clubhouse as well
2652075 it was a good day for me and i am looking forward to continue staying like that
2652076 he doesnt get rattled hes like one of your good college athletes when the game gets close and the chips are on the table thats when he comes through
2652077 after hitting a home run he could have easily come up swinging from the heels trying to hit another one
2652078 but that goes to show that his mental approach to the game is that much better than everyone elses at the age of 15 because after you hit a home run a kid before he gets up there hes swinging away so hes a special kid
2652079 you never know what the future holds but hes definitely a prospect at this age and hes definitely a division i talent
2652080 im really excited i cant wait to play with them its a once in a lifetime opportunity that means a lot to me
2652081 it means a lot to our program to have kids like that from our program involved in those programs because it gives us the ability to go were doing it right
2652082 if you want to play major league baseball thats fine thats going to happen regardless
2652083 my main concern is when it comes time to go to college that hes eligible to go to college if you want to sign fine but i want you to have the option to do this thats why youve got to pass geometry i keep harping on him about geometry
2652084 we teach him like a college kid at the age of 15 some of the guys on the team we wont teach like that
2652085 we want to teach them the game within the game within the game so they know the game better than the coaches theyre going to see and thats what its all about
2652086 we know theyve got physical tools great now lets teach them the game those are the guys that become game changers
2652087 hes one of those guys that theyre not on every street corner five tools these guys he obviously has a chance has a real good chance to be an impact player at the major league level
2652088 i was trying to do a little too much in that at bat in the sixth
2652089 i knew id get another chance and i just thought if it happens it happens
2652090 the ball kinda kicked away from the left fielder in the corner and got away from him
2652091 i went into third standing up and it was a bang bang play i just barely got in there i was pretty pumped that doesnt happen too often
2652092 gindl almost had one last night so they were giving him a lot of crap saying thats how its done
2652093 im just waiting for good pitches to hit and using the whole field it helps on a night like tonight when everyones hitting it kinda lights a fire in you and you feel like you can hit anything up there

2652096 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2652097 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2652098 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2652099 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2652100 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2652101 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people

2652106 its got such dedicated fans it has to be a wonderful trail
2652107 we didnt buy our house because of the prairie path but we have come to know what a joy it was to have it nearby
2652108 we have seen all sorts of activities on the prairie path it gets a lot of use all of it positive
2652109 its been very rewarding to see how important the prairie path has become because trails werent really a big deal when we got started
2652110 but nowadays its extremely important in this age of air pollution and congestion and getting people around
2652111 just the other day i was riding and i had to stop because a fawn was nursing in the middle of the trail where else are you going to see that and if i run out of water or an energy bar ill ride through a town a few miles later its just great
2652112 may watts spoke at my garden club shortly after the letter was published and she was getting a little famous from it
2652113 we consider the publication of the letter the birth of the prairie path thats when everyone started working on it anyway
2652114 word on the prairie path maybe thats how they find us
2652115 we dont have really big signs so id say the prairie path helps a lot
2652116 thats one of the long term visions if you will of the forest preserve to provide the linkage to the forest preserves and connectivity to the communities as well
2652117 right now you can go from a forest preserve in elmhurst to one in warrenville without ever going on roads and the prairie path serves as that link
2652118 they couldnt take it away now its too big a part of the city its that way for a lot of people
2652119 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2652120 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2652121 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2652122 from the time he was 3 he started to fish with my grandfather at this lake
2652123 within hours after we got the news we knew we wanted to do something
2652124 its just a fun thing to get the kids outside its all catch and release
2652125 he was the best man at my wedding he was the person that kept the peace but we always had a good time he would have given the shirt off his back for any one of his guys
2652126 he loved kids he used to brag about my kids like they were his own
2652127 fishing hunting he was just a great kid all around
2652128 weve seen reports attributed to a georgian minister saying that the russians have bombed the
2652129 we are not aware of that and i think we probably would be if it were true
2652130 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire this week
2652131 we have mobilised all forces including the military and police to overcome the effects of the floods
2652132 we are trying to get to the flood victims bury the dead and provide medical treatment to the injured
2652133 telecommunications cables have been cut in some areas it takes half a day to walk from the local commune headquarters to the places were victims are stranded
2652134 i sabotage it all even the last guy the one i liked so much i knew he was crazy i would be a fool to not know
2652135 i was in love you know and it was good the relationship was a
2652136 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
2652137 okay guys i believe you i know youre both superb guitarists now could we get down to some memorable tunes
2652138 this guy is the best in the world on his instrument
2652139 it tells you a lot about the sort of festival this is that the line up for the fresh water taps is longer than the lineup for the beer tent
2652140 its probably the most under appreciated position on the team
2652141 its one of those positions you dont think twice about until you dont have a long snapper
2652142 if we had a long snapper rolling balls back to the punter snapping it over his head
2652143 if we were having to go for it on fourth down all the time people would notice that the long snapper is pretty important
2652144 it gives an opponent more time to get a block point and the difference of a guy getting his finger on the ball and not getting his finger on the ball may be the difference in the hundredths of a second that the snap took
2652145 its an awesome opportunity for me to play more i took it real serious
2652146 i realized that i would much rather be out here working with the guys
2652147 they are all great academic institutions and i believe i would fit in well at any of them whether i was playing athletics or not
2652148 i had never experienced anything like wearing that national jersey and breaking the huddle with usa instead of your teams name
2652149 it was hard to tell him that i wasnt going there but it is hard to tell any coach that
2652150 the way i am looking at it is that im meeting some great men and have a chance to learn from them
2652151 i cant make a wrong decision from the schools on my list but i want to make the best one
2652152 right now he is a little confused about what he should do
2652153 john is still not sure he wants to take a little time to think everything through
2652154 there are a lot of rumors about john being a lock to baylor but that is not true
2652155 last year if we were out on the practice range we threw some deep balls we had some pretty routes we did a lot of things that looked good but the guy on the driving range the guy thats nailing that driver 300 yards that goes out and shoots a 95 is not going to win the tournament
2652156 so i think our guys really understand situational football a lot better this year
2652157 a lot of times when we threw the ball deep it was from 40 and back yates said
2652158 so if we can get the ball deeper into their territory we wont have to worry about taking as many shots
2652159 t j knows how first and second down affects third he knows when hes in four down territory he knows when were going to take shots he knows how one play affects the next just like a golfer knows how one shot affects the next shoop said
2652160 tiger woods only uses a driver they say four times a round we were pulling that thing out probably a dozen last year
2652161 hes going to have to come in and learn formations personnel groupings and those sorts of things
2652162 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2652163 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2652164 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2652165 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2652166 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2652167 she is a person of note in our little community
2652168 hey i noticed that youre listening to music on your mobile phone did you know that rhythmbox automatic playlists can limit by size and sort according to different criteria so you can easily fit them on your phone you listen to house hey did you know that blank and jones are coming to town
2652169 i just felt the race was perfect for him and everything had been going well in training
2652170 he quickened when i asked him to so i never saw what was happening behind me
2652171 well take him home give him time off and definitely come back to the united states for racing
2652172 ive been tempted for a while to come here for american racing especially with this horse
2652173 i wasnt on the best horse the others were not going to back up enough for us
2652174 so thats as much motivation as i need the top two quarterbacks are way ahead of me right now as far as knowing the offense and everything so im not too worried about them im just trying to keep focused on what im doing
2652175 at first i was a little antsy a little hyped up to be in a game and i sailed my first pass
2652176 but after that first drive i kind of settled in and felt a lot more comfortable you just try to stay as relaxed as possible and trust the linemen and receivers that theyre gonna be there for you
2652177 just to control the offense manage the game and try to do the best i can to stay poised
2652178 just go out there and show them that im ready and know my reads and everything just kind of simple
2652179 its a sad day joses going to be out for a while maybe a year
2652180 those kind of injuries you dont know how well youre going to come back hopefully he can pitch again
2652181 originally in the off season thats what i signed here to do help out in a starting role
2652182 if thats what they want by all means thats what ill try to do for the team
2652183 the guys in first place right now are playing better ball than we have the last couple of weeks and thats why we are where we are
2652184 everybody did a great job in the game out of the pitching staff besides logan
2652185 this is a pennant race i want men on the field weve got to step it up
2652186 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2652187 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2652188 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2652189 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2652190 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2652191 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2652192 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2652193 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2652194 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2652195 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2652196 denn was man von gott erkennen kann ist unter ihnen offenbar denn gott hat es ihnen offenbart denn gottes unsichtbares wesen das ist seine ewige kraft und gottheit wird seit der sch pfung der welt ersehen aus seinen werken wenn man sie wahrnimmt so dass sie keine entschuldigung haben denn obwohl sie von gott wussten haben sie ihn nicht als gott gepriesen noch ihm gedankt sondern sind dem nichtigen verfallen in ihren gedanken und ihr unverst ndiges herz ist verfinstert da sie sich f r weise hielten sind sie zu narren geworden und haben die herrlichkeit des unverg nglichen gottes vertauscht mit einem bild gleich dem eines verg nglichen menschen und der v gel und der vierf igen und der kriechenden tiere
2652197 the whole idea is to mix it together like gumbo in a pot and see what happens
2652198 its unique its a way to see elgin in a different light
2652199 were hoping for a positive response people have to be down here to make it a reality
2652200 its a wonderful idea ive been in a lot of businesses in downtown elgin theres a great variety
2652201 each of us have our own style and performances you can actually pack a lot into 10 minutes of theater we really think elgin has the best of the urban like chicago and suburban environment its a hidden gem
2652202 chelsea was into art as soon as she could hold a pencil or a crayon
2652203 we students all have a theme and mine is wasteful greed
2652204 my watercolor is about deforestation which really moves me i wanted to show the beauty of trees they grow for hundreds of years and we cant just cut them down we cant completely stop deforestation but we should be conscious of it and try to preserve what we have left
2652205 we wanted to recognize very talented students in the area
2652206 and we wanted to put them in with practicing artists high school students do it for themselves their work is very honest and if the subject is a littler edgy thats ok
2652207 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2652208 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2652209 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2652210 this walk means that dads efforts and his vision are being recognized and that means everything
2652211 he chaired the riverfront committee and he was the energy behind multiyear projects
2652212 he asked me to go to a kiwanis meeting with him i felt that anyone he was involved with had to be ok he was such a great guy
2652213 were just getting started on the actual field work taking pictures and taking notes of information supplied on the grave sites but there was a lot of preplanning involved and lot of paperwork to go through
2652214 its been a year in the works as there were many documents and records on the families to go through
2652215 thats a lot more than most people would have thought
2652216 brock is a great kid and this is going to be a great service to the people of the community especially those interested in family histories and lineage
2652217 those helicopters all had air or first class mail on them so it had to be delivered faster than what the trains could do
2652218 that was your most expensive mail and people paid extra for it
2652219 that helicopter had other drops other than in wheeler park but im not positive about that
2652220 my memory is not one of my stronger things these days
2652221 you strapped a bag on your shoulder and you took off
2652222 near the tail end of my time there you could drive your car to certain spots deliver the mail and then go back to your car
2652223 we keep on bumping into it when we talk about development in certain corners of town or in the comprehensive plan or when something is proposed
2652224 there might be a perception that is different from reality
2652225 people want to see the same thing across from their house
2652226 whats the use of 300 a month housing if you cant afford 4 a gallon gas to get to work
2652227 and you are going to have to dump 100 000 into it
2652228 a lot of this will be about rental for some people their money would be better spent raising their families than paying a mortgage but that concept is foreign to us
2652229 but the education no one can ever take that away from you
2652230 if i wasnt doing the right things in the classroom then i wouldnt be able to compete
2652231 when i ran the races and beat the other kids i thought ooh i like this
2652232 reading and learning and education has not stopped for me since kindergarten
2652233 if youre passionate about something and you love to do it share it with others
2652234 its got such dedicated fans it has to be a wonderful trail
2652235 we didnt buy our house because of the prairie path but we have come to know what a joy it was to have it nearby
2652236 we have seen all sorts of activities on the prairie path it gets a lot of use all of it positive
2652237 its been very rewarding to see how important the prairie path has become because trails werent really a big deal when we got started
2652238 but nowadays its extremely important in this age of air pollution and congestion and getting people around
2652239 just the other day i was riding and i had to stop because a fawn was nursing in the middle of the trail where else are you going to see that and if i run out of water or an energy bar ill ride through a town a few miles later its just great
2652240 may watts spoke at my garden club shortly after the letter was published and she was getting a little famous from it
2652241 we consider the publication of the letter the birth of the prairie path thats when everyone started working on it anyway
2652242 word on the prairie path maybe thats how they find us
2652243 we dont have really big signs so id say the prairie path helps a lot
2652244 thats one of the long term visions if you will of the forest preserve to provide the linkage to the forest preserves and connectivity to the communities as well
2652245 right now you can go from a forest preserve in elmhurst to one in warrenville without ever going on roads and the prairie path serves as that link
2652246 they couldnt take it away now its too big a part of the city its that way for a lot of people
2652247 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2652248 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2652249 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2652250 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2652251 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2652252 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2652253 ingat tanggal 26 agustus 2008 kalian bukan hanya memilih anggota parlemen dari permatang pauh tapi pemilihan ini juga akan menentukan apakah malaysia akan punya perdana menteri baru atau tidak
2652254 saya tegaskan lagi jika saya menjadi anggota parlemen maka pada 16 september 2008 malaysia akan punya perdana menteri baru
2652255 kami akan jaga kepentingan melayu tapi china dan india menjadi saudara sebangsa dan setanah air malaysia
2652256 kalau ada pejabat melayu yang korupsi itu akan jadi musuh dan lawan kita tapi kalau ada china dan india yang jujur membantu orang melayu maka mereka akan menjadi kawan dan saudara kita
2652257 setelah melalui operasi selama delapan jam di rumah sakit beijing kemarin wanita tersebut dalam keadaan kritis namun stabil
2652258 surat ke 40 anggota kongres as merupakan bukti nyata bahwa bukan hanya adanya dukungan dan campur tangan as terhadap urusan dalam negeri melainkan juga adanya dukungan terhadap gerakan sparatisme opm
2652259 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2652260 its good for the world to have girls playing softball
2652261 and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2652262 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2652263 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2652264 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2652265 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2652266 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society
2652267 all indications show the 2008 election will probably have the largest youth voter turnout the largest hip hop voter turnout in u s history
2652268 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2652269 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2652270 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2652271 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2652272 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2652273 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2652274 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2652275 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2652276 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2652277 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2652278 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2652279 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2652280 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2652281 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2652282 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2652283 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2652284 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2652285 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2652286 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2652287 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2652288 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2652289 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2652290 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2652291 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2652292 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2652293 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2652294 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2652295 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2652296 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2652297 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2652298 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2652299 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2652300 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2652301 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2652302 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2652303 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2652304 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2652305 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2652306 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2652307 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2652308 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2652309 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2652310 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2652311 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2652312 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2652313 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2652314 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2652315 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2652316 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2652317 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2652318 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2652319 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2652320 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2652321 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2652322 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2652323 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2652324 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2652325 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2652326 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2652327 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2652328 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2652329 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2652330 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2652331 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2652332 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2652333 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2652334 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2652335 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2652336 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2652337 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2652338 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2652339 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2652340 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2652341 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2652342 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2652343 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2652344 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2652345 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2652346 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2652347 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2652348 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2652349 theyve had four children including their eldest daughter catharine who is attending law school 9 year old emma claire and a 7 year old son jack their first child wade died in 1996
2652350 mccain loves lieberman and he is on the short list because lieberman has never embarrassed anyone never misspoken the first rule is dont take someone who costs you votes
2652351 conservatives would be pissed as hell i think you would have a revolt but sometimes john does what john wants to do
2652352 he can be pragmatic but on the biggest decisions he tends to favour his instinct for the bigger picture
2652353 the private lessons taught me this above all that frau forster nietzsche is a complete laywoman in all that concerns her brothers doctrine emphasis in original she lacks any sense for fine and even for crude logical distinctions her thinking is void of even the least logical consistency and she lacks any sense of objectivity
2652354 the poles i considered the most gifted and gallant among the slavic people and the giftedness of the slavs seemed greater to me than that of the germans yes i thought that the germans had entered the line of gifted nations only through a strong mixture with slavic blood xi 300
2652355 belief in the heredity of acquired characteristics and the conviction that race mixture might favor the attainment of culture both in nature and in individuals
2652356 in the early 1800s when he wrote thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche arrived at a conception of human life and possibility and with it of value and meaning that he believed could overcome the schopenhauerian pessimism and nihilism that he saw as outcomes of the collapse of traditional modes of religious and philosophical interpretation
2652357 insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature and that sympathy should be extended to all races and nations
2652358 we civilised men on the other hand do our utmost to check the process of elimination we build asylums for the imbecile the maimed and the sick we institute poor laws and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment there is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small pox thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind no one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man it is surprising how soon a want of care or care wrongly directed leads to the degeneration of a domestic race but excepting in the case of man itself hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed the aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts but subsequently rendered in the manner previously indicated more tender and more widely diffused nor could we check our sympathy even at the urging of hard reason without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature the surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless it could only be for a contingent benefit with an overwhelming present evil
2652359 the preservation of favourable individual differences and variations and the destruction of those which are injurious i have called natural selection or the survival of the fittest
2652360 destruction he meant it in a sterile victorian way rather than implying purposive violence or combat

2652373 what is it is not a self contained film so much as a jumping off point for crispin glover to personally engage the audience without his exigesis its well not a bad film perhaps but definitely an incomplete and unsatisfying one with it its a good night out that leaves you with plenty to chew over on the way home
2652374 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2652375 four dollar gas makes you not want to live in the suburbs
2652376 you dont know how many times we sit with general manager kenny williams talking about this ballclub for the last two weeks
2652377 and i just keep telling kenny i think weve got what we need
2652378 we try with clayton richard 6 0 2 45 era at charlotte

2652385 junior is gonna make this ballclub better yes hes just another player like everybody else obviously a hall of famer and famous but to me its just another guy on the 25 man roster that i can use

2652393 usfws mississippi flyway representative jim kelley spoke at our annual meeting and said the population appears to be stable well ok its stable with a two bird daily limit so why change it

2652418 the environment conservation levies were proposed in the 2007 budget but the delay in enforcing them was due to heated debates and constant opposition from various groups

2652425 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2652426 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2652427 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2652428 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2652429 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2652430 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2652431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2652432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2652455 england ist die lachnummer europas unn tz armselig geistlos ohne r ckgrat hoffnungslos abfall wir w rden gerne noch andere w rter benutzen aber die d rfen wir in englands lieblingszeitung nun wirklich nicht abdrucken
2652456 die brutale wahrheit ist dass der englische fu ball einfach nicht gut genug ist
2652457 england hat genau das bekommen was england verdient hat absolut nichts kroatien war gedanklich schneller spielerisch besser und k mpferischer ein tiefpunkt in der geschichte des englischen fu balls sie waren abgrundtief schlecht
2652458 carson elend leitet einen historischen tiefpunkt f r das erb rmliche englische team ein eine litanei von fehlern symbolisiert den wahnsinn der mcclaren ra
2652459 die em qualifikation f r england w re so verdient gewesen wie ein friedensnobelpreis f r hitler

2652462 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming
2652463 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2652464 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2652465 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2652466 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2652467 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler
2652468 and youre also seeing a lot of health issues from kids not building a fort out back or playing on the stoop and their neighborhood
2652469 i think its responding to a number of anxieties out there
2652470 the next generation is the one thats going to make or break us as a planet
2652471 not one person ive ever talked to doesnt think this is a good idea
2652472 this is really a product of thousands of educators pushing congress to get at it
2652473 youre sitting at a desk in rows youre engaging a couple of your senses if you go outside you engage all your senses
2652474 its so important to look at the education of the child in terms of the environment
2652475 weve got this growing crisis on our hands where weve got these kids magnetized to the computer
2652476 this idea is really catching fire all over the country we want our parks to be not just parks but learning laboratories for kids
2652477 kids are lacking the time outside kids come to summer camp and they get a little free time outside to play and they dont know how to do it anymore
2652478 our internet television service sets new standards in terms of content and design while using video images to convey the fascination and legends that surround the brand with the star
2652479 theres nothing like having a tall glass of milk fresh from the can
2652480 there is the main complaint that always happen such as chest painful beat rapidly and short winded
2652481 este resultado fue un tanto normal en los an lisis que hizo la jefatura de misi n con la federaci n mexicana de esgrima pero se determin que a pesar de esa circunstancia que era previsible la atleta estuviera en contacto con unos juegos ol mpicos
2652482 ya es un avance que hayan calificado esperemos que les vaya mejor que a ang lica aun cuando sabemos que ser muy dif cil
2652483 this incident reminds us of what happened during the apcet conference on east timor that was held a few years ago when members of umno barisan nasional forced their way in to sabotage the seminar
2652484 obviously some of them were trying to trigger ethnic and religious tension and conflict which could be manipulated to serve the interests of umno and the government it leads

2652488 we got her away from him before it got worse
2652489 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2652490 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2652491 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2652492 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2652493 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2652494 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2652495 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2652496 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2652497 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2652498 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2652499 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2652500 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2652501 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle

2652509 it hadnt occurred to me to have to explain myself with a letter or explanation to the student body explaining her points of view on the importance of the trip before the trip
2652510 but it was an awfully narrow point of view i thought to expect me to cancel the trip
2652511 i dont understand why people think my sitting here would have made a difference when ive been in constant contact with the team
2652512 hey ive been here for 11 years and im not making anywhere close to 100 000 maybe if i sell out a particular group like part timers instructors librarians or clts i will make 100 000 i should push for a vote now
2652513 scott for instance is just doing his job hes probably just reporting what hes being told to report
2652514 i paid for my education and therefore shouldnt be prevented from receiving that education by a strike
2652515 i wonder who theyre going to ask us to sell out tomorrow
2652516 any company that loses 25 of its customers is going to make a few layoffs in order to stay alive
2652517 is aufa aware that the strike is not hurting the people they intend to hurt

2652523 welcome to my marketing blog that will go on and on about marketing ideas and strategic stuff
2652524 this is related to that is rather similar to the other jibes with something weve read
2652525 so while me and jimmy were devastated you were screwing some girl you hooked up with at a bar
2652526 so much for having to sleep at work every night
2652527 she probably sat in it maybe she was naked in it
2652528 dont do this tell her you wont pay for it
2652529 the right thing the right thing is to not kill this baby you know that how do you even know if this is yours did she go to the doctor or did she just call you are you going with her or just giving her the money
2652530 i went with her to the doctors three weeks ago
2652531 my mind started doing the math that would have been right around the end of june when they went to the doctor
2652532 she told me the week before we went to the doctor on sunday
2652533 dont be part of this will she consider having it and giving it to us we can still get divorced but raise the baby together i would help you
2652534 no she doesnt want to have a baby she doesnt want to be pregnant
2652535 its my problem and i have to take care of it
2652536 yes i do i deserve this because for what i did to you this is my punishment
2652537 im sorry i know god doesnt want you to do this god says you should say no god says turn back now and come home to him
2652538 it was his child and he waited while we killed it
2652539 lord give me the strength to do what you ask me to do
2652540 i told you not to be involved with this sin i told you not to participate you will suffer so much more
2652541 no you shouldnt have been involved in it but god still loves you and you can repent of it
2652542 look at the damage it has caused for you already
2652543 no you invited it thats the only way it stays with you even now
2652544 jen i am trying to deal with this please stop you just making it worse for me
2652545 im sorry but you are the only one who can change things for yourself you made a choice you can make a different choice
2652546 ok you got to see that wasnt that fun for you
2652547 the only tears i will shed are for the child that was killed because of your influence
2652548 havent you done enough you have almost destroyed him and you and i both know the lord wants him for the kingdom his name is already written in the book of life he was sanctified through my faith your attack and oppression will not stop god from having his way
2652549 im right here i am still breathing bring your worst you wont stop me from believing you didnt stop job and you wont stop me i will keep getting up i will continue to stand

2652555 the double minded one stands at a parting of the ways two visions appear the good and the reward it is not in his power to bring them into agreement for they are fundamentally different from each other only that reward which god for all eternity adds to the good in the inner realm only that is in truth homogeneous with the good so he stands there pondering and reflecting if he is wholly absorbed in his pondering then he continues to stand a symbol of double mindedness but suppoise he should tear himself away from the dliberation and should know go forward along which way ah do not ask him about that perhaps he is able to answer learned questions and to betray extensive knowledge but one thing he cannot do one and only one thing he is not able to do he cannot answer the question about which of the two ways he is taking by repeated thoughtful pondering in an attempt to see the heterogeneous together he has somewhat confused his sight he believes he has found that there is a third way and that it is this third way along which he is going this third way has no name for it doesnt really exist and so it is obvious that he if he is sincere cannot say which way he is taking if he is sincere for otherwise he would indeed declare that he is going along the way of the good it may even be important to convince men of that in order that they may honor him for honor belongs to the reward which he is seeking after the third way is the secret which he keeps to himself and now how does he go along this third way which is narrower than any rope for it simply does not exist does he go steadily and firmly like one that has a definite goal before his eyes like one that scarcely looks at anything around him in order not to be disturbed like one that looks for one thing alone for the goal no only a person upon the path of the good walks in this fashion with only the good before his eyes

2652606 you have to think about the play that they call and what you do and where to step and its just a lot youve got like two seconds
2652607 i strived to come up on varsity and put forth the effort to help the team in any way i could
2652608 i saw myself playing on saturdays and im just going to keep faith keep working hard and hopefully ill see myself on that field opening day
2652609 i like it when we take the ball away and dont just recover a ball but are able to go score
2652610 i think back to whenever weve had good football teams we did that well
2652611 i thought the only guy that looked settled the first third of practice was shea
2652612 as the practice went along then eric herbort played a little bit better but herbie was too sloppy early
2652613 it swelled up enough where itll probably be a couple of weeks for sure
2652614 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2652615 is an amazing athlete but hes human one day someone is going to beat him
2652616 we barreled em up and they found holes you have to be kind of lucky to get that many in a row
2652617 were feeling pretty good about ourselves and playing as hard as we can
2652618 we have a lot of good players and its nice to get contributions from up and down the lineup
2652619 we try to put them through the same protocols that theyd experience at a major international competition
2652620 the 2012 team might be a little tight but for some of these athletes 2016 is very realistic
2652621 watching the opening ceremony was inspiring you want to be there
2652622 dude if i got with that chick over there i would treat her like a fucking hooker
2652623 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2652624 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2652625 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2652626 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2652627 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2652628 we are getting tired of people not living up to what they say
2652629 i thought he was trustworthy i didnt think he would do this
2652630 people should know that they cant get away with this
2652631 he has run for president twice and lost and now this his political career is over
2652632 as long as it was taken care of between he and his wife it is their personal business
2652633 clinton got away with it but he was already in the white house
2652634 he could never return to the status he was at
2652635 absolutely not he didnt live up to the morals and standards we have for high profile leaders
2652636 its sort of like if he had become the nominee then he really would have screwed us democrats
2652637 both of them theres a certain arrogance that they both must have to think they could just work it out among themselves personally i couldnt care less about it but i care because i want a democrat to win he shouldnt have been that risky knowing so much was at stake
2652638 its an extremely important election so its important democrats dont mess things up
2652639 but i think its wrong for any man to cheat on his wife
2652640 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2652641 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2652642 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that led you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2652643 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2652644 ive gotten to be involved in a lot of issues that do matter and thats why i do this
2652645 and im happy that im not locked in a small room with a telephone trying to raise money
2652646 there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2652647 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2652648 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2652649 so we cant kill it sometimes we dont have to kill it i know someone who faced even worse odds she knew only one person could die and that would be her she also knew there had to be a way to win because shed not only lose her life but her future her past and everything shed ever hoped to be she defeated her mmm mmm mmm fff opponent without doing much more than embarrassing it so i ask again if we cant kill it what the fff fff fff cowards die many times before their death the valiant never taste of death but once
2652650 i think there might be a way to corral our hydra its heads look vulnerable if you look closely each of its many heads seems tiny compared to the bulk of the hydra and their necks appear to be even smaller even better they dont look as heavily armored as the rest of the creature unfortunately ive been told that if you lop off one head nearly two identical heads grow back in minutes the only differences being slight changes in each heads color notice how the hydras heads come from common roots on its shoulders
2652651 isnt there any way to keep its heads from growing back
2652652 you char the severed neck and it wont grow back thats what bertram told me in a lesson on mythical creatures
2652653 sir percival claimed hed fought one with fire he said that by the time hed severed the last head he saw stumps elongating and he thought he saw the nubs of new heads forming on those stumps as he rode away
2652654 an hour at least if i recall accurately all percival told me
2652655 alfys fire look at that fff bridge i can still see smoke rising from the bridge and its been hours since we set it afire its almost all dragon fire we see what if we use it
2652656 but what good would that do the beast wont die and its still in the gap
2652657 but itll be blind pell well keep it blind as it chases us and when it does well ride around it and through the gap
2652658 fuck its so crowded in here and it smells like stink
2652659 what do you do besides broad casting our local news
2652660 well im an attorney for the a c l u i think im from florida im just visiting a friend here im recently divorced im 35 no kids
2652661 your the prettiest japanese person from china ive ever seen
2652662 come out tomorrow night with me and some friends we are going to el gaucho
2652663 im looking at chines people and they remind me of you baby i miss you

2652665 if its a girl lets name her fortune cookie or dim sum can you teach me chines how do you say i love you in chines no wait i want to name her sweet and sour chicken does your family know im white will they be okay with that
2652666 you left me some odd messages on my phone last night sour chicken were you trying to be funny
2652667 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community or to try to get away from those folks
2652668 freds the kind of guy thats very helpful to friends hes just a big hearted guy
2652669 when i heard his statement i didnt put any black heartedness on fred who was concerned about what these staffers were going through
2652670 cutarescu e baiat bun dar o cam bate pe nevasta sa
2652671 cutareasca e fata buna dar nu prea ii place scoala
2652672 no ven dentro del gabinete al sucesor del presidente o consideran que no hay nadie de un perfil alto que est identificado como el sucesor
2652673 nuestro ministerio es especializado hemos tenido logros importantes pero la gente no tiene una concepci n clara del trabajo que desarrollamos como la asignaci n de 150 bloques para exploraci n petrolera el problema con mi calificaci n es que todos los meses tengo que poner la cara para anunciar el alza de los combustibles y esto molesta a los consumidores
2652674 estoy muy halagado con estos resultados y me siento muy complacido con ellos pero actualmente estoy es en lo que estoy no estoy pensando en nada diferente a desempe ar mi labor como ministro si el presidente lvaro uribe decide lanzarse para la segunda reelecci n va a contar con todo mi apoyo irrestricto
2652675 we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia
2652676 not the stuff the american public wants to hear about in this election cycle
2652677 according to the sources of 1993 5 462 800 people live in georgia the main ethnic groups living in georgia kartleli imereli megreli kakheli guruli achareli rachveli svani are united under one name kartveli other nationalistic in georgia

2652683 how much taxpayer money has been pissed away due to mcstupid missing more votes than anyone else in the senate the last year jackass
2652684 how much taxpayer money has been pissed away due to mcstupid missing more votes than anyone else in the senate the last year jackass
2652685 funny how you dont say that exact same thing about drooliani
2652686 he gets paid as a us senator to show up and vote and on the taxpayers dime and why should i be
2652687 he gets paid as a us senator to show up and vote and on the taxpayers dime and why should i be
2652688 other than this presidential primary when exactly did edwards run for president after cheating on his wife skid mark
2652689 lets compare voting records vote for vote who shows up more who votes with bushco
2652690 why hes gonna win how is that a waste of money
2652691 yeah that makes a lot of sense seeing as how he got the dem vp slot 4 years ago where the hell was mcdepends 4 years ago
2652692 from 2 different universities and with degrees in 2 different areas how about you
2652693 yeah that makes a lot of sense seeing as how he got the dem vp slot 4 years ago where the hell was mcdepends 4 years ago
2652694 actually i was nine but i dont like to brag
2652695 why do you feel the need to justify yourself to us inferiority complex
2652696 i hope you can draw design the shit that you do a whole helluva lot better than you draw up a sentence or try to get a point across here
2652697 why do you feel the need to justify yourself to us inferiority complex
2652698 youre right he is running for president again what a waste of everyones time and money
2652699 i hope you can draw design the shit that you do a whole helluva lot better than you draw up a sentence or try to get a point across here
2652700 anyhoo i was in a high school when i was nine
2652701 youre right he is running for president again what a waste of everyones time and money
2652702 you are so lucky to have a guy like him
2652703 help me help me wont you sing me sing me one last song help me help me somebody help me save me from myself
2652704 its just another spin on the same old thing again
2652705 cannot send message using the server smtp me com my user id
2652706 perhaps the reformed tradition is the one i can identify with the most the place to call home
2652707 check the system status section at the lower right of your mobileme account summary window if the light is yellow or red there may be problems with the apple web server and you will see an alert informing you of a temporary outage
2652708 these individuals are partial to fish entrails and such and we laid out traps hoping to catch em with guts fish guts always works and when we came up with nothing we began to suspect the individual was something else
2652709 come sit and have a drink where the cows used to stink
2652710 am i mere cannon fodder am i being played for a fool am i nothing more than a capitalist tool
2652711 these strikers are just a bunch of lazy indians and dead enders who are always looking for a handout
2652712 theres no proof that heavy metal rodent hair or insecticide can hurt you in fact it adds to the taste
2652713 nothing to see here folks go about your business just keep shopping

2652718 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
2652719 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
2652720 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
2652721 one to show my respect for the people of china and two to cheer on the us team
2652722 how can i be a pediatrician i know nothing about babies
2652723 christian country would bring outcries form humanist groups all over the world
2652724 growing up that show was instrumental for me nobody ever said anything about it playing marc and wilhelmina that way we never talked about it but its in my blood
2652725 i grew up watching that show i grew up with cutouts of batman and the joker in my bedroom so thank you for saying that all were missing is the camera angles
2652726 our show has these amazing lines where we can be complete madcap silly zany camp but then also tug at your heart strings
2652727 i dont know how we get away with it the mysteries and the soap opera stuff it just works
2652728 theres going to be a lot more intrigue this season
2652729 wilhelmina now is the editor in chief of mode shes going to rule with an iron fist and cliff marks boyfriend is coming back
2652730 its so fun to play every day is a party we get to go to work and be silly for six hours
2652731 the only thing that could make me leave the house was doing this
2652732 the bar was kind of raised pretty high after borat came out because it wasnt just funny it was bringing up all kinds of serious issues and this totally touches on those things too
2652733 racism in the movie industry homophobia in the movie industry and drug addiction and all these lines youre not supposed to cross when youre making a movie we really blew open a bunch of taboos its kind of cool
2652734 he went at it with glee and there kept being more pages of dialogue that tom would request because he was going to have tremendous fun with that role
2652735 i think its unfortunate that people dont go to see movies about the war in iraq
2652736 but i also feel it is because were in a conflict thats very close to home and people dont want to go there for entertainment
2652737 this is a comedy about making movies its not a war comedy its not like catch 22 you know what i mean its really a different thing
2652738 those were all movies i grew up watching and was very affected by
2652739 i enjoyed getting in there and watching them while getting ready for this movie but this is really a comedy and lives in its own place i think sometimes in times of war people want escapism too
2652740 it was a very short list of people i thought could pull that off because you had to buy that he was one of the greatest actors of his generation so i knew that it couldnt be a comedy guy it had to be a guy who was one of the greatest actors of his generation it had to be a guy you bought in that role as a serious actor and yet the guy had to be funny too to be able to pull that off
2652741 meanwhile im an actor for hire and i make faces for cash and chicken and i thought this job would be really cool and interesting
2652742 i mean im not very evolved when it comes to big picture stuff i just know moment to moment
2652743 its funny and entertaining and if its done right its not offensive but i dont know if perhaps the risk outweighs the reward because the reward is that you make a comedy that people like and the risk is something so much more far reaching than that
2652744 we always say no its not that way its not that way
2652745 i think that might be more accurate yeah i dont think that woody sits at home you know with a thing of chow mein and a typewriter thinking like what is scarlett doing now and how can her life sort of inspire this tale certainly not
2652746 i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall
2652747 i thought she was too young to play the part she was only 19 years old at the time i had to get somebody fairly quickly and i knew by reputation that scarlett was a great actress and a beauty i didnt know if she was really what i had written
2652748 i hired her and became totally captivated by her i thought she could simply do anything she was not only beautiful but also bright amusing charming and gifted im very happy to work with her whenever there is a part that fits anything she could do i would always call her and hope that she would be available for it as i did with diane keaton for years i did that with mia farrow thought she was a wonderful actress and she never let me down i think that the same will be true with scarlett
2652749 i mean after the monthly payments im not surprised that he would say that
2652750 i mean its woody the idea of like woody allens steamiest film is so ridiculous to me its not like its bertolucci or something
2652751 i think theres a lot of chemistry between the characters and all of us as actors and thats where the steaminess comes from because its not really explicit i mean people kissing i mean nothing is like crazy about it
2652752 when youre shooting its so horribly she mumbles perhaps saying unromantic theres 60 grown men eating salami sandwiches waiting for when they can get up and watch the game or whatever nobody cares when youre doing it of course its like your day at work and this is part of the story
2652753 then of course people get wind of it and they get excited
2652754 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2652755 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2652756 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2652757 all art is a technological medium so a lot of it has to do with engineering how to create what you imagine its also something thats dictated to you by the amount of resources you have available to you if youre a pharaoh you build pyramids
2652758 given enough time and money anybody can create anything but given a very very restricted budget and very restricted resources its a challenge we had to build studios train people from scratch hire artists develop new techniques we did not make this in the normal way you make an animated feature
2652759 i was a jedi knight the same as your father
2652760 when we did revenge of the sith i lamented the fact that i had to jump over the clone wars because it had nothing to do with anakin skywalker he was just another player
2652761 it was like world war ii a huge canvas there to be mined so we decided wed do a little five minute animation series for the cartoon network which also ran in canada on teletoon in 2003 using anime and manga and we hired a really great director in genndy tartakovsky
2652762 and that got me going to do a regular tv show a half hour show using cg animation so i said when we finish sith im gonna do it im gonna fill in a blank in the star wars universe and we can have a lot more fun with it
2652763 and when the first few shots came back and i looked at them on the big screen i said this is better than we ever imagined
2652764 i happen to have a couple of daughters so i said instead of making it a guy why not make it a girl its fun and girls are just as hard to deal with as boys are when theyre teenagers
2652765 with ahsoka i wanted to develop a character whod help anakin settle down at the end of episode ii hes kind of a wild child and he and obi wan dont get along
2652766 a really great actor like a tom hanks doing an animated movie was a revolutionary idea that belonged to dreamworks animation boss jeff katzenberg they do it for the publicity two days in the studio then they spend two weeks doing press
2652767 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2652768 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2652769 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2652770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2652771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2652772 the biggest part of the program is to deter theft not to make arrests
2652773 they wanted absolutely no contact between industry and medical schools
2652774 my moms has literally been knocked off four or five times when they do the mowers
2652775 the last indignity was when we went to bury my uncle and saw that my mothers marker was not only moved but covered by a filthy tarp
2652776 it sounds like there was a lot of miscommunication going on
2652777 were going to end up putting them in the monument row
2652778 we chinese invented writing and paper and printing and gunpowder and the compass
2652779 and we spread our power by land and sea we are exquisite resourceful and unique
2652780 we are a high and ancient civilisation growing in strength
2652781 competent foreign residents here berlin say that the german government and people really do desire peace and one has seen several things in this festival which suggest that germany wants to impress her olympic visitors not only with her efficiency but also with her desire to be friendly
2652782 if by the grace of god we stand steadfast in our great traditions through this time of stress we shall insure that we and our sons and daughters shall see these fruits increased many fold
2652783 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
2652784 jeg kan n v re snill jeg kan la jenta f ha en kjempefin kveld p byen
2652785 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
2652786 you are blessed with divine power it is not that your words come true but god speaks through you hereafter you should speak about god to your devotees it is your mission in this world to make as many people as possible understand that the divine exists
2652787 i made this ashram for a particular reason to spiritually uplift the devotees i made it for the sake of all of you you want to develop the highest wisdom and attain realization and so i have created an environment conducive to your development
2652788 in spite of the power of the worldly illusion and the ego will there is a way to go towards the truth go towards it surely and steadily still the mind and bring it to one point how first find the most suitable environment and place to practise it is said that an ashram life is best there you will find peace knowledge culture and devotion there the universal knowledge is vibrating wherever holy persons have placed their feet those places pulsate with grace full power when you also walk there that grace enters you automatically if you attain the spiritual masters grace then gods grace is also yours with so much divine grace you will surely gain wisdom
2652789 the ashram is in a simple style it is traditional in order to make the mind clear and uncomplicated a luxury life leads to a luxury mind the background is important to change ones mind and lead it to the highest spirituality
2652790 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2652791 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2652792 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2652793 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2652794 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2652795 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2652796 last year a customer who left with 8 000 euros 12 200 dollars worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3 000 or 4 000 euros 4 600 or 6 130 dollars worth were happy
2652797 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 euros 76 600 dollars
2652798 yachts of more than 40 metres 130 feet belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre 49 to 115 feet yachts there is a very big drop in numbers
2652799 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening
2652800 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years
2652801 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am
2652802 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer
2652803 people who have a lot of money are ready to spend but they have become more demanding over quality
2652804 the economy is decelerating sharply the correction in the construction sector is still ongoing and the outlook for the near to medium term is rather bleak
2652805 we believe the deterioration of spain is just in the beginning stages
2652806 the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
2652807 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
2652808 the almost recession is having an impact i suppose people are going out less than before
2652809 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2652810 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2652811 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2652812 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2652813 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2652814 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2652815 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2652816 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2652817 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2652818 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2652819 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2652820 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2652821 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2652822 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2652823 gather ye rosebuds while ye may old is time still a flying and this same flower that smiles today to morrow will be dying
2652824 this case is yet another step we are taking to help the noreve brand become one of the most unique and recognized case manufacturers in the world
2652825 we look forward to working with additional types of precious stones in our future designs
2652826 i think were a fairly strong community so when someone starts bashing someone that died that we will unite together we have to show that canada will not tolerate this
2652827 i dont believe its any of my personal business to be inside the funeral because i didnt know him but i believe showing support outside theres nothing wrong with that this is just an honest silent way of showing the way we feel
2652828 if your kids show an interest in the election encourage it
2652829 remember that its less important to know all the answers than it is to be open to discussion so spend as much time listening as you do talking
2652830 at the present time approximately one out of six members of wake forest baptist church is gay or lesbian
2652831 we could not justify continuing to support in a major way major for our congregation an organization that on principle would discriminate against 15 of the members of our church on the basis of their sexuality
2652832 i have not attended a meeting of the cbf since the policy was approved
2652833 the desire to appeal to the broad middle of the moderate movement that has been present since the beginning of the cbf is not one that our congregation has chosen to embrace nor is it one i have chosen to embrace in my own ministry
2652834 i understand and appreciate where you and wake forest baptist church differ with our funding and hiring policy regarding homosexuals
2652835 this is an issue where baptists have differences of conscience and convictions i respect the protest of your congregation just as i respect the fellowships decision to implement this policy
2652836 i treasure your friendship and thank god for your ministry
2652837 unlikely to pose any significant risk to morale good order discipline or cohesion
2652838 one of the most comprehensive evaluations of the issue of gays in the military since the rand study 15 years ago
2652839 many lawmakers want to untie the militarys hands on this policy
2652840 and todays report will likely add pressure on congress to act
2652841 we respectfully urge congress to repeal the dont ask dont tell policy
2652842 as is the case in britain israel and other nations which allow gays and lesbians to serve openly our service members are professionals who are able to work together effectively despite differences in race gender religion and sexuality such collaboration reflects the strength and the best traditions of our democracy
2652843 one of them is addicted to a lot of different drugs and is an alcoholic and the other is very against that
2652844 it is their story of how they deal with these problems and how it affects their relationship
2652845 i think that being gay will help me in my character development
2652846 i believe i will put some of myself in the character i play
2652847 it will be easier to have it be a part of our society and not have it ridiculed
2652848 when we started working with the play i was able to get theatre charlotte to work with us
2652849 they told me to think about having another name to be the other producer i decided to make the company an official thing instead of just a one time thing
2652850 the name of the company yellow bird comes from the first play i directed the crucible
2652851 during the courtroom scene one of the main characters abigail williams says she sees a yellow bird in the rafters
2652852 ive never heard of any company that focuses on these issues i wanted be a little different than any regular theater company here in charlotte and draw in different types of audiences
2652853 i havent really thought about next year but i do know that i want to do more than one show
2652854 id love to do the laramie project and there are a few others that im hoping to look at
2652855 we the undersigned affirm the lives of gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered people we condemn acts of bigotry and hatred we join pflag in celebrating the lives of those we love and admire acceptance and love family values for a lifetime
2652856 the importance of non discrimination laws cannot be overstated substantively they provide real remedies and a chance to seek justice
2652857 at least 300 companies now ban discrimination based on gender identity and expression corporate america and the american people are way ahead of the congress in acknowledging the basic truth we all hold to be self evident all of us are created equal the laws of the land should reflect that equality
2652858 fifteen expensive reasons why safe schools legislation is in your states best interest
2652859 in 2004 glbt issues were used by the right wing in an attempt to distract and manipulate voters rock to win is a celebration of the progress our community has made in the intervening four years and a grand kickoff to hard work ahead in the general to elect a new president of our nation
2652860 commissioned national survey demonstrates the potential for significant political impact of marriage protection amendments on the november ballot in california florida and arizona
2652861 a recent field poll shows that a majority of californians support marriage equality
2652862 the frc thinks that anti gay voters are mccains best hope to win his home state of arizona but arizona voters have already rejected this tactic at the polls this just smacks of desperation
2652863 rea proved to be an extremely strong and charismatic leader in the interim position
2652864 there is no basis for this whole fabrication and malicious attacks it is just a repeat of the 1998 script you can see the pattern
2652865 i was attending one of crape myrtle festivals fundraising events and got to talking with tim simmons president of the cmf board of directors
2652866 the passion and dedication that he had and still has for this cause really got to me and i was at a point in my adult life where i felt it was time for me to give more back to the community other them just writing a check i really felt a desire to be more hands on
2652867 securing corporate sponsorships and fundraising in general has been our biggest challenge this year
2652868 with the struggling economy and rising energy costs corporations as well as many individuals are having to scale back on their charitable contributions
2652869 in recent years aids and hiv has become more mainstream
2652870 it is no longer just the gay mans disease with all the advances in research and the many new drugs on the market though it does not cure aids or hiv it certainly has made the disease more manageable for many of those who are infected and they can lead relatively normal lives
2652871 with that said many of the younger generation do not realize that aids is not curable and one can still die an early death with this disease and they are not taking the necessary precautions in practicing safe sex
2652872 we are now seeing an increase in the number of new cases being reported and if we dont continue to keep an awareness by educating and informing the community we may very well see the epidemic that we had back in the early to mid 1980s
2652873 im not st peter im ralph and this isnt heaven the big guy hasnt decided what to do with you yet helms hes well aware that conservatives believe you should be in heaven and liberals think you belong in hell hell make up his own mind eventually go through the gates and sit on the bench weve arranged for a few visitors
2652874 jesse i knew youd get here eventually remember how when i went to beijing you accused me of appeasing red china i just want to say up yours with a pair of splintery chopsticks
2652875 actually im here just to see you lord knows i wasnt perfect but hes seen fit to give me a place upstairs deal with it
2652876 now jesse in life you relied on race baiting to get elected you found low down ways to scare all those white people into voting for you remember 1990
2652877 you were losing to the black candidate until the famous ad showing a white mans hands crumpling a job application with the voiceover you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
2652878 youre just mad because i was the only senator to vote against your holiday you communist
2652879 im glad you brought that up the 16 day filibuster you staged against me caught the attention of the big kahuna who said that if you can delay that long youll have no trouble being patient while he decides what to do with you i think were looking at more than 40 days and 40 nights here
2652880 you may not be pleased to see me jesse but it could be worse it was a toss up between me and some victims of the el salvadoran death squads you supported
2652881 and who could forget your battle with the nea for subsidizing my photos you made me a household name honey by the by i wont tell you where i landed afterlife wise but for tonight were roommates
2652882 where should a demagogue go you get credit for loving your country trouble was that country was the confederacy you were dedicated to public service but you cared only for a portion of the public
2652883 i might not agree with him but at least i know where he stands
2652884 white people wake up before its too late do you want negroes working beside you your wife and your daughters in your mills and factories frank graham favors mingling of the races
2652885 to rob the negro of his reputation of thinking through a problem in his own fashion is about the same as trying to pretend that he doesnt have a natural instinct for rhythm and for singing and dancing
2652886 unless our negro citizens submit more easily than we predict they will north carolina does not have the simple choice between segregated schools and integrated schools
2652887 our only choice is between integrated public schools and free choice private schools the decision will have been made by a very small minority of people who are hell bent on forced integration
2652888 i viewed the late senator many a time when he was a commentator on wral
2652889 for me as a young child of color his blunt unforgiving unacceptable views were distressing and surreal to watch
2652890 the negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint thats thus far left him free to clog the streets disrupt traffic and interfere with other mens rights
2652891 crime rates and irresponsibility among negroes are a fact of life which must be faced
2652892 jesse helms was astute kind witty and one of the most polite and fair minded individuals i have ever known nothing like the caricature often painted by the media
2652893 in those days there were very few women in television outside of secretarial positions and very few minorities
2652894 we want to do everything possible so that everyone is comfortable and every person who comes is able to hear jay speak
2652895 jays message of gods unconditional love for all people is desperately needed today
2652896 people are being hurt daily by hateful words and actions to the point that the legislators of north carolina attempted passing anti bullying legislation an action i personally applaud
2652897 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2652898 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2652899 the original plan was just to go to las vegas and have fun
2652900 and then we found out about the marriage thing and i said well lets go get married
2652901 when youve been together as long as we have whats the need of those things
2652902 even though south carolina doesnt recognize it i feel married
2652903 we were more nervous than we thought we would be and more emotional than we thought we would be
2652904 we had already lived out the vows it was just about saying it at that point for sickness and in health been there done that
2652905 if enough gays go out there and do this and come back to their own states maybe theyll have some impact on those idiots who are trying to prevent it
2652906 you never know exactly whats going to happen unless its tested
2652907 early and unnecessary losses in arizona and indiana hurt our other cases including in new york washington and maryland where we lost by close margins and the courts adopted contorted reasoning from those decisions
2652908 and because so far more marriage cases have been lost than won taking on a principled but long shot case and racking up more losses now just makes it harder to convince other courts and legislatures
2652909 if we bring a marriage case in which a court says that the constitution does not protect us those arguments will be harder
2652910 its going to seep into everyday life in every other way in states like south carolina its going to cause some things to have to be dealt with
2652911 well win marriage because individual couples get married tell their family friends co workers and community that they are married and talk in very practical terms about why it is so important and about what it means to be same sex and married with all the fundamental freedoms that others have
2652912 that was a defining moment for the lesbian and gay community in north carolina i think you absolutely can call it this states version of stonewall
2652913 but as a black lesbian i was also very aware of his horrible record on civil rights even george wallace and strom thurmond understood that things were changing but helms was not letting go lets not forget that he was an equal opportunity destroyer
2652914 it was around 1989 and she was working for the national gay and lesbian task force she was in durham for a hearing because the city council was considering a gay anti discrimination policy afterward she asked a few of us what we were going to do about jesse helms
2652915 we needed to do something but we didnt know what
2652916 going to take time off to work on this thing to defeat helms
2652917 that meant we could raise and spend as much as we wanted but we could have no contact with the gantt campaign
2652918 we had people contacting us from greensboro charlotte asheville wilmington asking how can i get involved when we saw that we decided it was time to go public in the traditional press the response was incredible and thats when we knew we had something money started pouring in from our friends outside north carolina it was just remarkable
2652919 we had a strategy meeting in chapel hill where we were wondering how we would pull together enough votes to defeat helms
2652920 even if we got every gay person to vote we figured it wouldnt be enough we started to think who would work with us on this that led us to get a copy of helms voting record
2652921 arts environment education people of color gay and lesbian allies pro choice these were the groups we knew we should be in contact with it was an alliance that we needed then and im happy to say that it still exists to this day that historic moment really got down to the roots of who would be the progressive coalition in north carolina
2652922 when i saw that one i said this elections over but it still didnt soften the blow because we had experienced all these mini victories money volunteers this amazing alliance we had put together along the way to lose like that at the end was devastating
2652923 luscious french accent let me see your vis bulla to fight vampires

2652930 i want you to prepare for me a legislative program for the revival of the new england economy
2652931 we must face the fact that the united states is neither omnipotent nor omniscient that we are only 6 percent of the worlds population that there cannot be an american solution to every world problem in short we are neither warmongers nor appeasers neither hard nor soft we are americans determined to defend the frontiers of freedom by an honorable peace if peace is possible but by arms if arms are used against us
2652932 the american presidency requires the young in heart and health if not necessarily in years because of all the midnight meetings the early morning briefings the saturday sessions and the constant crises

2652936 if i can get paid to do that then im in
2652937 if i can get paid to do that then im in
2652938 i mean i had time to do everything i needed to get done so it must not have been overwhelming
2652939 i dont give much but i do believe the kids need to be able to show and know they understand what ive taught
2652940 the only way to do that is to do it on their own
2652941 i still need to know that theyve understood what ive taught that they have mastered that standard
2652942 i tell them it builds and they need to learn daily its like running down a track in front of a train youd better keep running because the trains going to catch up
2652943 but im also not so egocentric to think that my class is all they have to worry about they have other classes other responsibilities beyond what homework i might give them
2652944 if i could not teach them what they needed to know in that time i didnt expect them to go home and continue learning
2652945 when children leave school they need to have the opportunity to be children
2652946 japan does less homework well they have a longer school year and its the common practice for parents to send their kids to after school school
2652947 you cant make that comparison and conclude we give more homework than they do in japan
2652948 i think that beyond how much is assigned will turn out to be the real question
2652949 i let them know that first day whats expected of them and i dont give homework on the first day of school
2652950 i mean i had time to do everything i needed to get done so it must not have been overwhelming
2652951 i dont give much but i do believe the kids need to be able to show and know they understand what ive taught

2652961 never before has such ready cooperation been given by other calhoun county communities in a local project

2652963 mayor coleman is expected to toss the opening ball there will be no great formality attached to the opening where other cities including gadsden have arranged parades and other furbelows local officials have been of the opinion that the baseball fan wants to hear the crack of the bat and see the game
2652964 and the directors feel that the right to a decision on the future of the southeastern league franchise belongs to the stockholders

2652966 would be justified in coming to the rams aid on this score as well as for the less tangible benefits to be derived through the showing that anniston can field a ball club in competition with others representing cities the size of montgomery and pensacola
2652967 although the series opener with gadsden produced one of the best played games of the year the small crowd consisted mostly of gadsden patriots the group of stockholders who were so enthusiastic at fridays baseball rally here failed to turn out in a body
2652968 freshmen in the southeastern conference are allowed to play only three games each season a special ruling allows alabama to play four this year therefore the highly interesting frosh tilts are especially hard to obtain

2652982 her tits had clocks melting off of them and were covered in ants
2652983 we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges unlike any weve ever known right now our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack our changing climate is putting our planet in peril and our security at risk and our economy is in turmoil with more and more of our families struggling with rising costs falling incomes and lost jobs
2652984 theyre oppressed by taxation and inflation poisoned by pollution terrorized by urban crime frightened by the new youth culture baffled by the computerized world around them theyve worked all their lives to get their own little house in the suburbs their color tv their two cars and now the good life seems to have turned to ashes in their mouths their personal lives are generally unfulfilling their jobs unsatisfying theyve succumbed to tranquilizers and pep pills they drown their anxieties in alcohol they feel trapped in long term endurance marriages or escape into guilt ridden divorces theyre losing their kids and theyre losing their dreams theyre alienated depersonalized without any feeling of participation in the political process and they feel rejected and hopeless their utopia of status and security has become a tacky tacky suburb their split levels have sprouted prison bars and their disillusionment is becoming terminal
2652985 america stinks and its up to us to set it right
2652986 the despair is there now its up to us to go in and rub raw the sores of discontent galvanize them for radical social change well give them a way to participate in the democratic process a way to exercise their rights as citizens and strike back at the establishment that oppresses them instead of giving in to apathy well start with specific issues taxes jobs consumer problems pollution and from there move on to the larger issues pollution in the pentagon and the congress and the boardrooms of the megacorporations once you organize people theyll keep advancing from issue to issue toward the ultimate objective people power

2652991 people always said hes not a home run hitter he cant do this or that
2652992 i never tried to hit 20 but its kind of cool to be able to say i did it just shows how much some people know about baseball
2652993 the knock on me was that i was never going to hit 40 home runs listen you dont need to hit 40 home runs to drive in runs in this league youks a great hitter thats the bottom line he comes up with big singles and doubles he doesnt need to hit the ball out of the ballpark to drive in runs im the same guy
2652994 i just go out there and try to square up the ball
2652995 you hope that hey it finds a gap or maybe even goes over the fence every once in a while if you hit the ball hard youre going to get doubles and home runs
2652996 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
2652997 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2652998 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2652999 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2653000 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2653001 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2653002 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2653003 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2653004 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2653005 enormous agenda over the next three years to make sure its business was in the best possible shape for whatever transactions were available to it
2653006 there is a whole string a list of events that took place over the course of this sorry tale
2653007 this string of events really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the ioc the olympic movement as a whole into disrepute based on this the board made its recommendation that she should be ineligible
2653008 is fiscal market with any kind of loan which gets approved faster

2653047 why do you feel the need to justify yourself to us inferiority complex
2653048 youre right he is running for president again what a waste of everyones time and money
2653049 i hope you can draw design the shit that you do a whole helluva lot better than you draw up a sentence or try to get a point across here
2653050 anyhoo i was in a high school when i was nine
2653051 youre right he is running for president again what a waste of everyones time and money
2653052 i dont mind not eating meat if it bothers you
2653053 this time we tried the restaurants usually we stick to the booths but we decided to do it differently this year
2653054 its a good time to advertise for free people walk by see the sign say well come back after musikfest when things are little less hectic
2653055 there are people who like to come in and try something new those who dont want to sample the fare down in the grounds of musikfest theyll come in and eat sit and eat a meal before a concert
2653056 they sometimes come in for diversions but a lot of times i think its just to look
2653057 it means we will become self sufficient as a tribe
2653058 i wont need no more federal dollars i wont need no more state dollars
2653059 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
2653060 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
2653061 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
2653062 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
2653063 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
2653064 he will probably be the last of the real chefs
2653065 shes selling us satisfaction the smug reassurance that mediocrity is quite enough
2653066 hell i could do that i aint gonna but i could if i wanted
2653067 i would likely be arrested if i suggested on television that any children watching should promptly go to a wooded area with a gun and harm themselves
2653068 the good leadership example of sen lorenzo m ta ada
2653069 i only came to this party to do two things kick some ass and drink some beer looks like were almost out of beer
2653070 but sources say the public pronouncements are just posturing by the agency to buy time following a deal between nasas top brass and the astronauts to address their concerns fully after the design review is finished next month the preliminary design review or pdr is a key examination of the rocket plans to make sure everything is on track to work as advertised the astronauts office portion of the review concerns itself principally with the safety of the human occupants aboard the rocket while there are no details about what exactly is bothering the astronauts there have been tensions in the past over changes that the ares design is forcing on the orion crew capsule where the astronauts sit engineers are concerned that the rocket may not be powerful enough to lift the capsule with all the bells and whistles the astronauts want earlier this year there were reports of a fight between nasa designers and the astronaut office about the designers wanting to remove redundant safety systems as a way to slim down the capsule the astronauts won and the safety systems got put back in the face of the latest reports of trouble sources say that nasa leaders are looking at a possible replacement design including one that would use the shuttles two four segment solid rocket boosters and a liquid engine with four rs 68 engines and no upper stage while it sounds similar to a rocket called the jupiter 120 or the direct 2 0 concept which is being proposed by moonlighting nasa engineers the sources insist it is not the same the idea is to find a rocket capable of getting astronauts to the international space station and low earth orbit allowing nasa to work on the larger ares v rocket that would provide the heavy lift necessary to be able to return humans to the moon
2653071 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2653072 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2653073 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process

2653081 summer is almost over let her have fun when school actually starts then she will deal with it
2653082 a week or two before maybe two weeks gradually move them over from a summer schedule to a school schedule
2653083 if we leave you alone well be dragging you out of bed
2653084 youre fighting human nature here by making some of these kids get up early
2653085 it really means some very strict control of the environment
2653086 work with the school board to change the start times
2653087 the first win two years ago was an honor but this is a real thrill and i am looking forward to sunningdale already i have friends who are members there and it is a great course
2653088 my putting on the first day was very uncharacteristic lots of three putts and that evening chris said my putting stroke looked jerky and i needed to smooth it out
2653089 i birdied the first two holes the next morning and i never had a three putt again the last two days so i owe this win to her
2653090 im just going to go out and play my game and give it my best shot
2653091 im putting better than i was last year which is good
2653092 the only real difference that i might have kind of forgotten about last year was that it is 36 holes and its so important to stay patient just because i think its easy to get frustrated or worried but 36 holes is a lot of golf and really anything can happen im just going to make sure that i stay very patient
2653093 last year if we were out on the practice range we threw some deep balls we had some pretty routes we did a lot of things that looked good but the guy on the driving range the guy thats nailing that driver 300 yards that goes out and shoots a 95 is not going to win the tournament
2653094 so i think our guys really understand situational football a lot better this year
2653095 a lot of times when we threw the ball deep it was from 40 and back yates said
2653096 so if we can get the ball deeper into their territory we wont have to worry about taking as many shots
2653097 t j knows how first and second down affects third he knows when hes in four down territory he knows when were going to take shots he knows how one play affects the next just like a golfer knows how one shot affects the next shoop said
2653098 tiger woods only uses a driver they say four times a round we were pulling that thing out probably a dozen last year
2653099 hes going to have to come in and learn formations personnel groupings and those sorts of things
2653100 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2653101 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2653102 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2653103 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2653104 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2653105 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2653106 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2653107 ideapad netbooks come equipped with either microsoft windows xp or linux
2653108 the ideapad s10 netbook comes equipped with microsoft windows xp
2653109 we won some games that we played well in and we won some games where we didnt do so well
2653110 we understand we could have played better we know that once we move the ball on offense and all play together then were an unbelievable team when we dont we become just as good as anyone else thats the most important thing we figured out
2653111 teams are not in awe of us as much as they were with the dream team
2653112 theyve seen us they know us they want to play us they feel they can beat us and thats ok we have to get it done
2653113 thats the point were trying to get across if we can run offense like were playing against ourselves thats much better
2653114 all these guys would rather play in big games theyre ready to play olympic basketball games for the u s
2653115 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing
2653116 there are three things that i like formula atlantic was fun grand am was great to drive but nascar is the most fun ive ever had racing
2653117 im enjoying myself more then i ever had in the past in racing i just appreciate the moment we race in front of crowds that are unbelievable to be able to be a part of the sprint cup series i feel like a pretty fortunate guy
2653118 i think that im going to be at gem but its racing and things happen pretty quickly
2653119 ever since ive been in nascar ive only had one shot at it
2653120 i have to qualify the car every week to make the race and at one point its like ill give it my best and theres nothing more that you can do
2653121 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2653122 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2653123 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club
2653124 they are all great academic institutions and i believe i would fit in well at any of them whether i was playing athletics or not
2653125 i had never experienced anything like wearing that national jersey and breaking the huddle with usa instead of your teams name
2653126 it was hard to tell him that i wasnt going there but it is hard to tell any coach that
2653127 the way i am looking at it is that im meeting some great men and have a chance to learn from them
2653128 i cant make a wrong decision from the schools on my list but i want to make the best one
2653129 right now he is a little confused about what he should do
2653130 john is still not sure he wants to take a little time to think everything through
2653131 there are a lot of rumors about john being a lock to baylor but that is not true
2653132 as you grow older you tend to try to calm down a little bit more and realize what you have to do that its going to help you be the best player you can be out there
2653133 obviously its a tough major and we know that we are not used to seeing this kind of major on a pga championship but its still a major so you just got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully you will be there on sunday
2653134 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2653135 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2653136 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2653137 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2653138 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2653139 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2653140 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2653141 its just a real honor to race for the pettys i never thought that i would be able to drive for the king so i jumped at the opportunity
2653142 i told richard petty that i want a bonus if i finish in the top 10 i want a signed richard petty hat that i can put on my wall i think that would be the coolest thing that id ever get
2653143 elliott never retired he just quit coming by you know what i mean
2653144 so when somebody calls him and tells him to come back he just comes back
2653145 ive always said that if id had the career that richard petty had or dale earnhardt sr had or somebody like that then you look at it and say yes those guys need to retire
2653146 on the reverse side mark martin announces his retirement and then he signs up for a full year next year you dont want to be that person either
2653147 it is a challenge i wasnt anticipating facing this challenge this season
2653148 it is tough for any team really to have to be in that position it is part of the business and you hope that you come out on the other end better off and in a better position
2653149 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
2653150 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2653151 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2653152 its been about 12 years and i think weve finished second about 12 times since our last win
2653153 it sure is fantastic it feels like ive got a huge load off my shoulder
2653154 weve committed a lot to do this ive dragged my family halfway across the world to do this were a team thats moving forward and i feel like we needed a win to justify moving forward the way we plan to
2653155 its hard to just beat people we were able to put ourselves in the right position to win the race
2653156 the only one im curious about for game 1 is our center hardwick
2653157 well know 10 days to seven days before our opener against carolina but otherwise i am extremely thrilled about the medical report on our players
2653158 norv turner was the right coach at the right time
2653159 im even more convinced of that this year after last year i know people looked at me like i was crazy i know people looked at the schottenheimer firing like it was a personality conflict and it didnt go any deeper that wasnt the case
2653160 its probably the most under appreciated position on the team
2653161 its one of those positions you dont think twice about until you dont have a long snapper
2653162 if we had a long snapper rolling balls back to the punter snapping it over his head
2653163 if we were having to go for it on fourth down all the time people would notice that the long snapper is pretty important
2653164 it gives an opponent more time to get a block point and the difference of a guy getting his finger on the ball and not getting his finger on the ball may be the difference in the hundredths of a second that the snap took
2653165 its an awesome opportunity for me to play more i took it real serious
2653166 i realized that i would much rather be out here working with the guys
2653167 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2653168 we have to take every game as we go and we cant take anybody lightly because everybody has something to prove against the usa
2653169 anything less is failing its a lot of pressure to do it but its what we have to do
2653170 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2653171 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2653172 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2653173 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2653174 fomos informado esta manh claro que ficamos satisfeitos e aplaudimos a decis o que tomaram de continuar aqui nos jogos
2653175 o presidente do comit ol mpico georgiano seu secret rio geral e o ministro dos esportes vieram comunicar esta manh a jacques rogge a decis o de continuar participando nos jogos ol mpicos
2653176 isto reflete o esp rito ol mpico e os valores dos jogos a decis o correta sobretudo pelos atletas que n o queriam voltar
2653177 quando estou na gua n o sei a idade que tenho algo que n o importa uma vez que voc s est l dentro
2653178 muitas mulheres e homens da minha idade me procuram para dizer que sou uma inspira o para eles e que agora fazem coisas que n o imaginavam que podiam fazer a idade s um n mero e espero que minha idade abra caminho para outros atletas que quiserem voltar ao esporte
2653179 this game we play against china its bigger than life itself
2653180 its something i will tell my grandkids about and we need to win it we need confidence even though we are who we are we still need that added push
2653181 it was only a few years ago we had to drag them here that was a little embarrassing in itself
2653182 we have one task one goal to win the gold medal
2653183 n o pensei no cansa o senti muito a diferen a do clima muito seco aqui agora tenho que torcer para ver se ela maria garcia ganha a pr xima luta para eu entrar na repescagem
2653184 fiz uma t tica para me defender dos golpes dela e faltou atacar mais
2653185 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2653186 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2653187 you know there are a lot of things we cannot control the thing we can control is ourselves try to deal with it try to be strong
2653188 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them
2653189 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2653190 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2653191 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2653192 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2653193 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted to have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2653194 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2653195 there was a lot of fear of cannibalizing the product
2653196 we found out it didnt instead it made people more addicted
2653197 were going to have the opportunity to really mix things up
2653198 if youre not ahead of that curve if youre behind or even equal with the curve youre not going to catch up
2653199 i used it to left handers a lot i got a strikeout on it a number of outs on it i got some first pitch strikes on my curveball i thought that was key its probably not in the scouting report for them over there
2653200 im very confident i know my numbers arent great for the overall season but right now i feel like i can beat anybody i feel like im at the top of my game
2653201 i didnt know who to go hug catcher kelly shoppach or benny
2653202 having an extra pitch like a curveball just opens up a whole new area for me
2653203 its the hardest ive ever seen him get hit that never happens it really doesnt
2653204 my job is pitching my job is to go to the mound and throw six seven eight innings but today i didnt do my job
2653205 i lost the count how many four well good for them there is nothing you can do about it just move on and think of my next start
2653206 i really had no idea its one of those things
2653207 for me as long as im having good at bats and going up there not making bad outs im ok obviously at 0 for 29 it didnt turn around for a while i was able to get a couple in there and take advantage of a couple balls he left up
2653208 thats the hardest ive seen z get hit in the last two years ive been here i thought hed throw the ball better but it happens to anybody the cardinals are a good hitting team
2653209 we were aggressive and the wind was blowing out it was one of those weird days at wrigley
2653210 its finally good to get to a guy like that because hes very good
2653211 he allows us to police ourselves sometimes you have a manager who yells at you every night but he doesnt do that hell sit you down and talk to you and teach you
2653212 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2653213 que hace bastante intuitiva y atractiva la exploraci n de las im genes
2653214 we dont know if hes going to be back or not
2653215 hes got a tear in that ligament it is all going to be dependent on how it reacts in the next couple of weeks
2653216 theres not a whole lot he can do right now
2653217 i cant tell exactly when to expect him back or if he will be back it would be dangerous to return this season if there is not some pretty quick healing
2653218 well see how he feels as the afternoon progresses im not saying that well be able to use him im not saying were not
2653219 when hes ready hes ready i dont know i dont anticipate it being long term just hope its not as long as the finger
2653220 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2653221 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2653222 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2653223 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2653224 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2653225 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2653226 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000
2653227 the obama plan would reduce taxes for low and moderate income families but raise them significantly for high bracket taxpayers

2653240 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2653241 our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families

2653253 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
2653254 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development

2653612 what struck me was the complete depth of microsoft software that the updates will touch this month
2653613 the bug could be a cross over to multiple programs
2653614 it will be a different kind of work this month
2653615 the potential for downtime is a little less for one thing if a single laptop fails because it didnt get its ie patch thats not so bad as last month when an exchange server could have gone down after patching
2653616 the interoperability lab is essential to the industry in that it encourages it professionals and enthusiasts to explore the possibility of interoperable technology this will be a good venue for them to be creative and imaginative and to explore technology without boundaries

2653628 theres inadequate inequitable distribution of facilities for safe abortions contraceptive usage is low in india hence the great demand for safe abortion services

2653631 awareness about abortion through drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol is also low despite they being legal and easily available
2653632 we need to generate awareness at the community level about contraception and safe abortion in both rural areas and urban slums

2653665 whether there is anything else behind what david said i havent discussed with him but i think having said what he said its probably just as well that hes enjoying himself on holiday and that has allowed the rest of us to get on with the day to day stuff of politics and taking on the tories
2653666 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2653667 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became egocentric and narcissistic

2653672 to love at all is to be vulnerable love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give your heart to no one not even to an animal wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness but in that casket safe dark motionless airless it will change it will not be broken it will become unbreakable impenetrable irredeemable

2653680 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2653681 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2653682 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2653683 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2653684 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2653685 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2653686 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2653687 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2653748 nepal buddhist federation strongly condemns the vilification of our spiritual master and seek formal apology from the police for destruction of the photo of his holiness the dalai lama and tearing down buddhist flags we call upon the government to take immediate steps to control the situation before it turns into ugly sectarian communal violence
2653749 nepali buddhists are closely observing that of late buddhist monks nuns and all himalayan people in traditional dress are constantly harassed by the police even some sections of political media have increased attack on the person of his holiness the dalai lama in the name of maintaining diplomatic relation with neighboring country
2653750 ever since the introduction of buddhism in tibet in the 7th century himalayan buddhists of india nepal and bhutan used to go to tibet for studies in the various monasteries and after the closing of northern border in 1959 himalayan buddhists continue to go to monastic educational institutions in india and return to their respective countries after graduation to serve their communities the unbroken close spiritual bond between the dalai lamas and the buddhist followers of himalayan region began 363 years ago during the great 5th dalai lama and is continued even today the dalai lama is our root guru
2653751 tearing down the photo of his holiness the dalai lama and buddhist flags has hurt the religious sentiments of the buddhist community in nepal we consider this the first barbaric act since the time of rana regime such acts in total violation of the fundamental religious freedom and expression enshrined in the constitution of nepal will not be tolerated in secular nepal and campaigns to restore respect to our faiths our spiritual masters and international image of our country will be launched

2653793 me proponen 80 mil pesos para que les saquemos del medio a beroiz por el puesto que l ocupaba en el gremio de camioneros
2653794 nunca me nombraron a nadie del gremio no me daban muchas explicaciones
2653795 primero pens que era un trabajo as nom s cuando empec a ver de qu se trataba no hab a manera de salir eran pesados y me daban a entender que no hab a vuelta atr s

2653970 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2653971 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2653972 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2653973 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2653974 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
2653975 you know the difference between cannibals and liberals cannibals only eat their enemies
2653976 america is not at war the marines are at war america is at the mall

2653978 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2653979 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2653980 enormous agenda over the next three years to make sure its business was in the best possible shape for whatever transactions were available to it
2653981 every one of the messages in hair is equally resonant today as in 1967
2653982 is about the environmental movement its about the antiwar movement its about the gay liberation movement its about the feminist movement the black power movement
2653983 its all of these ideas that came out of a piece of history when there was huge possibility and huge potential
2653984 theyre taking concepts and much like the ziegfeld follies setting them in a revue type of situation with a narrative drawn through that isnt as clear as it would be in say oklahoma or gypsy
2653985 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told channel 9
2653986 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2653987 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2653988 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2653989 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2653990 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty he said
2653991 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2653992 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday

2653997 the difference in the game tonight the way i saw it was cabrera got out of the first inning and then we scored

2654000 the true amount of economic damages suffered by plaintiffs and the statistical likelihood of liability in class action discrimination cases

2654002 he and i talked about the possibilities of african americans going into business
2654003 the brilliant guy he was i knew he would go off and do things on his own
2654004 i had to fight with him over the bills like any other client
2654005 when i hear his name what comes to my mind

2654015 when we went to the pinnacles we were all stoned and each time we stopped someone would leave a mug of wine behind we lost a lot of mugs that day
2654016 the nerve of her expressing feelings and writing emotions and such she should be ashamed does she not know she is a guide there is no room for objections only agree agree agree
2654017 why the boink would you care if someone changed their profile background to an image of their name or a picture of their favorite band or a picture of their actual face

2654029 the meeting will definitely take place but if progress can be made if we are out of the meeting then we will not attend it

2654031 there is no love sincerer than the love of food
2654032 the japanese industries do have cutting edge advanced nuclear power generation technology certainly we think our companies are as competitive as any other companies abroad to do business in india
2654033 it is too early to comment elaborately on the issue
2654034 i do not deny that there will be huge business opportunities
2654035 it makes sense to have greater cooperation but i dont think were ready to have one global super regulator
2654036 and thats all right so dont you give up now so easy to find just look to your soul and open your mind
2654037 the big question for us is the execution of the offense
2654038 more than ever we will commit to running the system in the past because our system was in its infancy we had to plug in other things or resort back to other things now we are at that point we need to execute against everything and against everybody
2654039 in our study of our offense of the last two seasons running the triple option is the best opportunity for us to have success consistently and does not make us rely on specific talent or personnel
2654040 to make defenses respect that you have to execute that
2654041 as far as the overall attendance in the summer andrew had more consistency he certainly navigates the offense well
2654042 austin too he can certainly navigate it we want both of those guys to compete and we think the best situation for us is where we have two guys competing for one position
2654043 theres five or six guys competing so thats a good situation

2654194 a great nation now demands that its leaders abandon the politics of partisan division and find creative solutions to promote the common good a people that prizes candor accountability and fairness insists that a government for the people must level with them and champion the interests of all american families a land of historic resourcefulness has lost its patience with elected officials who have failed to lead
2654195 and so democrats through the most open platform process in history are reaching out today to republicans and independents who hunger for a new direction and a reason to hope
2654196 the republican leadership said they would keep us safe but they overextended our military and failed to respond to new challenges they said they would be compassionate conservatives but they failed to rescue our citizens from the roof tops of new orleans neglected our veterans and denied health insurance to children they promised fiscal responsibility but instead gave tax cuts to the wealthy few and squandered almost a trillion dollars in iraq they promised reform but allowed the oil companies to write our energy agenda and the credit card companies to write the bankruptcy rules
2654197 leadership on these issues has been sorely lacking these past eight years in the 1990s under bill clintons leadership employment and incomes grew and we built up a budget surplus
2654198 from the mother working two jobs to pay the bills and the couple struggling to care for young children and aging parents to the tens of millions of americans without health insurance and the workers who have seen their jobs shipped overseas too many americans have been invisible to our current president and his party for too long the people who do the work in america have never been invisible to the democratic party
2654199 health care should be a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford employers should have incentives to provide coverage to their workers insurers and providers should ensure high quality affordable care and the government should ensure that health insurance is affordable and provides meaningful coverage as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance and take steps to lead healthy lives
2654200 health care reform must also ensure adequate incentives for innovation to ensure that americans have access to evidence based and cost effective health care research should be based on science not ideology we need to invest in biomedical research and stem cell research so that we are at the leading edge of prevention and treatment
2654201 we oppose the current administrations consistent attempts to undermine a womans ability to make her own life choices and obtain reproductive health care including birth control we will end health insurance discrimination against contraception and provide compassionate care to rape victims we will never put ideology above womens health
2654202 we reject the notion of the presumptive republican nominee that social security is a disgrace we believe that it is indispensable
2654203 we will strengthen the ability of workers to organize unions and fight to pass the employee free choice act we will restore pro worker voices to the national labor relations board and the national mediation board and we support overturning the nlrbs and nmbs many harmful decisions that undermine the collective bargaining rights of millions of workers
2654204 we will expand the family and medical leave act to reach millions more workers than are currently covered and will enable workers to take leave to care for an elderly parent address domestic violence and sexual assault or attend a parent teacher conference
2654205 we the democratic party are the party that has produced more women governors senators and members of congress than any other we have produced first woman secretary of state the first woman speaker of the house of representatives and in 2008 hillary rodham clinton the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation we believe that our daughters should have the same opportunities as our sons our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2654206 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2654207 we must ensure that every student has a high quality teacher and an effective principal that starts with recruiting a new generation of teachers and principals by making this pledge if you commit your life to teaching america will commit to paying for your college education well provide better preparation mentoring and career ladders where there are teachers who are still struggling and underperforming we should provide them with individual help and support and if theyre still underperforming after that we should find a quick and fair way consistent with due process to put another teacher in that classroom
2654208 at community colleges and training programs across the country we will invest in short term accelerated training and technical certifications for the unemployed and under employed to speed their transition into careers in high demand occupations and emerging industries we will reward successful community colleges with grants so they can continue their good work we support education delivery that makes it possible for nontraditional students to receive support and encouragement to obtain a college education including internet distance education and night and weekend programs we need to fully fund joint labor management apprenticeship programs and reinvigorate our industrial crafts programs to train the next generation of skilled american craft workers
2654209 our institutions of higher education are also the economic engines of today and tomorrow we will partner with them to translate new ideas into innovative products processes and services
2654210 today we are again called to provide visionary leadership this centurys threats are at least as dangerous as and in some ways more complex than those we have confronted in the past they come from weapons that can kill on a mass scale and from violent extremists who respond to alienation or perceived injustice with terror they come from rogue states allied to terrorists and from rising powers that could challenge both america and the international foundation of liberal democracy they come from weak states that cannot control their territory or provide for their people they come from an addiction to oil that helps fund the extremism we must fight and empowers repressive regimes and they come from a warming planet that will spur new diseases spawn more devastating natural disasters and catalyze deadly conflicts
2654211 the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was we will defeat al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan where those who actually attacked us on 9 11 reside and are resurgent
2654212 we believe taxpayer dollars should be spent to invest in our fighting men and women not to fatten the pockets of private companies
2654213 we believe that in the 21st century the u s must treat canada latin america and the caribbean as full partners just as our neighbors to the south should reject the bombast of authoritarian bullies
2654214 and we must build ties to the people of cuba and help advance their liberty by allowing unlimited family visits and remittances to the island while presenting the cuban regime with a clear choice if it takes significant steps toward democracy beginning with the unconditional release of all political prisoners we will be prepared to take steps to begin normalizing relations
2654215 we will encourage china to play a responsible role as a growing power to help lead in addressing the common problems of the twenty first century
2654216 our starting point must always be our special relationship with israel grounded in shared interests and shared values and a clear strong fundamental commitment to the security of israel our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy that commitment which requires us to ensure that israel retains a qualitative edge for its national security and its right to self defense is all the more important as we contend with growing threats in the region a strengthened iran a chaotic iraq the resurgence of al qaeda the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah we support the implementation of the memorandum of understanding that pledges 30 billion in assistance to israel over the next decade to enhance and ensure its security
2654217 the creation of a palestinian state through final status negotiations together with an international compensation mechanism should resolve the issue of palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there rather than in israel all understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel the parties have agreed that jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations it should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths
2654218 we also support the adoption of humanitarian licensing policies that ensure medications developed with the u s taxpayer dollars are available off patent in developing countries we will repeal the global gag rule and reinstate funding to the united nations population fund unfpa we will expand access to health care and nutrition for women and reduce the burden of maternal mortality
2654219 american leadership on human rights is essential to making the world safer more just and more humane such leadership must begin with steps to undo the damage of the bush years but we also must go much further we should work with others to shape human rights institutions and instruments tailored to the twenty first century we must make the united nations human rights organs more objective energetic and effective the u s must lead global efforts to promote international humanitarian standards and to protect civilians from indiscriminate violence during warfare we will champion accountability for genocide and war crimes ending the scourge of impunity for massive human rights abuses
2654220 for the millions living here illegally but otherwise playing by the rules we must require them to come out of the shadows and get right with the law we support a system that requires undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine pay taxes learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens they are our neighbors and we can help them become full tax paying law abiding productive members of society
2654221 and we need to crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants especially those who pay their workers less than the minimum wage its a problem when we only enforce our laws against the immigrants themselves with raids that are ineffective tear apart families and leave people detained without adequate access to counsel
2654222 we honor the central place of faith in our lives like our founders we believe that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires we believe that change comes not from the top down but from the bottom up and that few are closer to the people than our churches synagogues temples and mosques to face todays challenges from saving our planet to ending poverty we need all hands on deck faith based groups are not a replacement for government or secular non profit programs rather they are yet another sector working to meet challenges of the 21st century we will empower grassroots faith based and community groups to help meet challenges like poverty ex offender reentry and illiteracy at the same time we can ensure that these partnerships do not endanger first amendment protections and that public funds are not used to proselytize or discriminate we will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are only used on programs that actually work
2654223 too many fathers are missing missing from too many lives and too many homes children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and are more likely to commit crime drop out of school abuse drugs and end up in prison we need more fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception we need them to understand that what makes a man is not the ability to have a the courage to raise one we will support fathers by providing transitional training to get jobs removing tax penalties on married families and expanding maternity and paternity leave we will reward those who are responsibly supporting their children by giving them a tax credit crack down on men who avoid child support payments and we will ensure that payments go directly to families instead of bureaucracies
2654224 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
2654225 on criminal justice its a bit disappointing while it stresses prevention and drug treatment including more drug courts theres a lot of emphasis on more cops and nothing criticizing mandatory minimum sentences
2654226 as we combat terrorism we must not sacrifice the american values we are fighting to protect in recent years weve seen an administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand the democratic party rejects this dichotomy we will restore our constitutional traditions and recover our nations founding commitment to liberty under law
2654227 we support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving americans
2654228 to build a freer and safer world we will lead in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the american people we will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law we will respect the time honored principle of habeas corpus the seven century old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our supreme court we will close the detention camp in guantanamo bay the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years with these necessary changes the attention of the world will be directed where it belongs on what terrorists have done to us not on how we treat suspects
2654229 we will vigorously enforce our voting rights laws instead of making them tools of partisan political agendas we oppose laws that require identification in order to vote or register to vote which create discriminatory barriers to the right to vote and disenfranchise many eligible voters we oppose tactics which purge eligible voters from voter rolls
2654230 there is only one guarantee that you are buying organic food and that is an official certification from one the irish organic farming bodies or an approved body in another eu member state if the seller cant show you the certification then you have no assurance whatsoever about what you are buying

2654232 georgia has a 2 000 strong contingent supporting the u s led coalition in iraq and washington provides training and equipment to the georgian military
2654233 in a conflict that russian officials claim has killed 2 000 and left 30 000 homeless
2654234 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo
2654235 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
2654236 liriano was a freak before he got hurt he was throwing 98 and there was not a comfortable at bat against him now hes still finding it im sure hell get a little better will he ever get back to where he was he was throwing 92 mph sliders before he got hurt
2654237 i think the long inning might have gotten to him when he had to go back out there
2654238 he had a good breaking ball his fastball was in and out i think he had a better change up and breaking ball than fastball
2654239 so then why the hell are you in here instead of out there
2654240 one hundred years after col drake completed the nations first successful oil well in titusville pennsylvania the new orleans oil centennial committee deposited historical documents here to commemorate the occasion
2654241 era some estimate that global oil supplies will begin to decline in mid century and that by 2050 the decline in production rates from having used up this limited resource will be precipitous
2654242 bill customs tariff law is very important as it took in consideration even the air conditioner of 8a function in customs tariffs will be limited and little while we impose higher tariffs on conditioner operating with 20a
2654243 goods that enter without tariffs and without fees had harmful influence on the work of private and mixed industry because the prices of raw materials and the cost of producing the private sector are higher than we imported and this law for consumer protection and preservation of the private and mixed sector through the non admission of goods with the trademark
2654244 we cared of public health where imposing tariffs on cigarettes which could reduce the number of smokers
2654245 that the installation of devices and machines of modern manufacturing plant for liquid gas cylinders instead of old machines on wednesday for the purpose of modernizing the refinery production lines and improve the quality of production and stopping the bottlenecks occurring in productivity
2654246 the new machines have been installed in the lab were welding bottleneck machines and welding base as well as the maintenance of some machines for the factory production lines by the engineering and technical staff of the plant
2654247 energy production after the new installed machines will be 300 thousand cylinders per year while the energy production were not exceeding 200 thousand cylinders per year since the foundation of the lab
2654248 the management of the lab encouraged a number of staff in the development and training sessions to work on modern equipment
2654249 considering the guy who did it the first time its pretty awesome
2654250 anytime you win this its the best thing you can ever do in sprint car racing
2654251 they say youve got to run second before you can win it so hopefully weve got that out of the way
2654252 jason did one heck of a job the caution probably did him in there at the end of that race
2654253 i told him i think you do have to finish second before you win this thing
2654254 when our employees become proficient in english and assimilate into our society it benefits the company the community and the individual everyone gains
2654255 u s business and hispanic integration expanding the economic contributions of immigrants
2654256 there is a fear of being labeled as aiding and abetting undocumented immigrants
2654257 you dont have to run fast you just have to run all day
2654258 i thought he was a little crazy when he told me he ran 100 mile races
2654259 theres never been a mountain runner in america like him
2654260 hes like lance armstrong on the tour de france course
2654261 id always wanted to do it even as a kid
2654262 my bodys holding up well with the exception of one nasty blister that im slightly concerned about
2654263 its been raining the last few days so its extra wet running on the wet trail is like running on an ice rink
2654264 the difficulty of the terrain is usually underestimated especially going southbound
2654265 he always gives 100 percent but he knows when to back off too
2654266 core i7 that means no matter bloomfield lynnfield or havendale will officially get their name
2654267 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain ive got my fingers crossed hopefully tomorrow will be better
2654268 the readings that we were looking at indicated that we have no cause for concern at this stage
2654269 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog right now im just knackered
2654270 we seem to be stuck in a weather pattern that is bringing us high humidity and higher than normal temperatures but despite all this the air quality continues to remain in the satisfactory range that does not pose any threat to the athletes
2654271 across the organization associates have contributed to quills growth by providing innovative ideas and solutions for challenges and opportunities
2654272 we launched a program a few years ago to facilitate our ability to become a company of ideas it is this wellspring of ideas coming from all over the company that is helping fuel our growth and will assist us in remaining competitive into the future
2654273 one of our junior staff members modeled out a program that would potentially create a 9 million revenue stream for quill to ensure the ideas success we have promoted her a vice president will mentor her as she works to make sure the idea takes hold throughout the company having worked on creating an innovative environment over the past few years this is the kind of success and excitement we hope to continue to foster well into the future
2654274 sometimes the simplest ideas are ones that make the difference
2654275 since the ultimate goal of the innovation program is to make innovation an organic part of quills approach to business quill recognized that such a program can only be ingrained within the company when it is supported from the top down creating a culture of innovation
2654276 in fact every vice president throughout the company is required to identify three challenges that exist within their areas that are important to the business the vps then must generate innovative ideas to address these opportunities our challenge now is to ensure innovation becomes imbedded in our culture and becomes part of what we do on a daily basis
2654277 before you can multiply you must first learn to divide
2654278 i am the owner of a business how do i retain my top talent
2654279 wrong as of today you own 80 go into the office of your top 10 people and tell them that they are now partners in the business give them 2 each they will have a greater sense of ownership besides this is probably the amount you would have given them as a bonus anyway
2654280 you feel like youre going through a fake amusement ride
2654281 if you dont climb the great wall you wont be a real man
2654282 i can count on one hand the number of races ive started sweating before the race starts
2654283 what role does god or your faith play in helping you get through tough financial times
2654284 there is nothing surprising about the fact that nearly 4 out of 5 low income americans regard their faith as a comfort in hard economic times
2654285 i have not seen a scientific poll but observation tells me that people who have little materially seem to trust god more than those who have an abundance
2654286 apparently there are no atheists in foxholes or in recessions
2654287 trust god ask the hard budgetary questions of yourself and your family and make the tough decisions
2654288 russian planes bomb aircraft plant in georgia the associated press
2654289 a cynic knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing
2654290 7 things you can do to save your job or create a new one
2654291 for the first 24 hours i was a mess i was begging the concierge to open the business center at 3 a m so i could keep tabs on what was happening 17 in flight hours away in new york i was driving the hotel staff and myself a little bit nuts
2654292 then something happened on day 4 of my stay i was shaking out my beach towel the sun was starting to edge down my hunger was beginning to rise up a lobster bake was going on somewhere and as the grains of sand flew out onto the beach i realized i had forgotten something i had forgotten to check my e mail indeed i had forgotten about e mail entirely for nearly the whole day and heres the funny thing it was on this vacation that my life changed in many wonderful ways not the least of which is this i learned that taking a break from the stress of daily life gives you the resources to better handle it when you return
2654293 what if you gave away your intellectual property how would you need to re invent your business

2654295 it has no meaning beyond michel bauwens hi gregory unfortunately most of the time complex thinking requires 10th august 2008
2654296 the development of a modular standardized graphical language was key to the rapid advance in electronics and critical to the eventual evolution of the industrial ecology of the later computer industry as the logical structure of the schematic language logically compartmentalized the architecture of systems which in turn established a hierarchy of modular components and subsystems for the electronics industry to organize itself around the frequency of reusability of a particular component with a particular set of functional features or a boilerplate circuit in larger systems designs could define its potential market as a mass produced product but electronics has generally had the benefit of a two dimensional topology circuits have always been assembled on a flat board and with the more recent exception of photonics interfacing components have always interfaced in one manner through simple conductive wire links while finished product engineering has required skillful optimization of the layout of components down to the dimensional characteristics of circuit board traces and component wire leads generally volumetric organization of electronics systems has been unimportant and the simple rule of thumb of keeping your 2d lines as short as possible has been the basic design strategy when one moves to the realm of electromechanical devices one confronts a much more complex topology a 4d topology because while the artifacts are 3d assembly in 3d requires a prioritization of component assembly order which becomes another additional dimension and you have many more ways components interface electrically photonically hydraulically pneumatically mechanically in linear and rotary manners chemically in the form of reactive processes and so on
2654297 cad cam today remains in the stone age because its still dealing only in the simple dimensional characteristics of single monolithic components which works because current generations of digital machine tools themselves still only deal with solitary monolithic component production none of them can do assembly or automatically transport product between each other for staged processing so they dont have to understand an artifact on any more sophisticated level they dont have to do anything more than run byte code like a printer but future machine tools will feature more complex integration machines shops will be clusters of workstations where systems hand product off to each other in dynamic order so there needs to be a higher level of characterization a recipe for the production and assembly process associated with the design of an artifact a collective program for its creation the one solution that has come to my mind so far for doing this is simulation used alternately by human and machine intelligence in other words after one develops a physical design for an artifact as a collection of components in a particular volumetric form one must break it down into an ordered production of parts and their assembly this is done in a virtual environment graphically represented for human users that simulates the processes of production based on generic representations of fabrication processes and the topological characteristics of common machines a manual definition of the production process can be done by a human user but given sufficient detail in the simulation machine intelligence based on procedural modeling can also work this out on a trial and error basis in the simulation i call this process taylorization after the in famous frederick taylor and the resulting intermediate process software taylor programs
2654298 how do we characterize designs and their production recipes in a standardized was in the here and now for easy human communication and collaboration this is a very old problem for at least as long as language itself has existed weve relied on static planar graphical representations of objects as a means to develop and communicate designs but when it comes to translating that into process weve long had problems with it being able to interpret design drawings into a production process largely without any formal methodology has been a key skill talent among trades guilds and later engineers and it was the need to leverage this skill that precipitated mass production logic methodology has been ad hoc our first formalized characterizations of process may have come with the written communication of music and cooking which both in turn precipitated mathematics and chemistry but it seems that it wasnt until the turn of the 19th century that we saw a real breakthrough in this for manufacturing through the inventions of the cutaway and exploded view drawings time lapse photography and the unlikely marriage of the do it yourself movement and comic strips early hobbyist literature tends to mimic cooking literature with the addition of simplified forms of formal technical drawings and isometric drawings as employed in architectural design but with the cultivation of a sophisticated line art illustration tradition among the publishers of novels there was a cross over of talent from comics where a sophisticated temporal language had developed from earlier traditions of action or drama illustration going back centuries but reaching peak sophistication by the early 20th century comics are 4d they have this ability to communicate time and motion and to manipulate time in the way cinematography does yet much more concisely by merging this with the cooking recipe style of organization you arrive at the step by step diagram or sequential line illustration strategy of representing fabrication processes which today has seen its most sophisticated expression in the instructions for lego and other model kits and in the artwork of illustrators like peter auschwenden famous for his work with john muir and such legendary books as how to keep your volkswagen alive a book whose blending of diy graphics with the aesthetics of the california rock art and underground comix movements set the standard for style of illustration for all soft tech and green literature since
2654299 todays maker blogs only really support p2p participation through iterative development in other words like a youtube video an artifact recipe is the sole province of an individual user for other users to participate in improving that artifact or just its presentation they have to create a new version iteration of that design and a new recipe some people may devise far superior designs or techniques but cant present them as well so their improvements wont be adopted as part of a definitive version these blogs dont seem to have figured out as open source software communities have how to implement a means of collaboration on a more elemental level because the whole recipe document is the minimum element of representation for the artifact and there still is no standardization in that yet this is no big deal for the small artifact like a novelty lamp made from a laser cut parmelot box or some such but what about an open source car people will always have varying levels of productivity at different aspects of development and production some are better at design others at engineer others at fabrication others at testing and analyzing the finished article and others at teaching other people how to make things just plain better screen presence so there needs to be a mechanism that allows participation at the level of these individual elements of a recipe and allows iterative evolution of these independently of the design
2654300 thinking about how all this might impact the creation of the open source everything archives i arrived at the notion of a wiki esque platform that was more dynamically object oriented rather than simply hierarchical as wikis tend to be and which could integrate a very large spectrum of media associated with an artifact recipe the basic organization would be by standard models of a particular artifact which might optionally have an associated family of variant models with each model having its series of iterations each model standard or variant would have its own communications channels most likely in the form of a discussion forum with several purpose categories including reports and an automated faq forum and its own set of recipe elements variant models can be introduced by anyone as either true variants or as contender iterations of the standard model being promoted to a new iteration of the standard model by community consensus any variant might also have its own sub variants which likewise can be promoted up the class hierarchy or just stand alone variant models could also merge on group consensus into iterations combining incremental innovations thus allowing both divergence and convergence usually culminating in new standard iterations along the evolutionary path of an artifacts design recipe elements would consist of design images formal technical drawings associated schematics and other diagrams component lists engineering break downs and analysis software files and fabrication and operating instructions in the form of written graphic audio or video instructions each of these would use the same system of variant and contender iterations within the context of that particular model wherever they arent already using a standard model recipe element they get promoted with the model they are associated with if that model becomes the standard this whole archive would be object oriented so that if an artifact is an assembly using another artifact as a subcomponent all references to that subcomponent link to its standard or variant model front page and its component design illustrations can be incorporated in media for the model using it ive also assumed this archive would need to include an archive of technique in addition to specific artifact recipes this would essentially be courseware associated with particular tools and would be composed of a package of instructional media for a particular tool or technique with an associated discussion forum and again employing that same strategy of standard iterations and variant and contender iterations this seems to largely parallel the approach with things like sourceforge so this might not be so far out in feasibility but there would need to be standardization in recipe element file and document formats even when incorporating this media diversity and here again things get problematic with the key fabrication and operating instructions because of the inability in establishing any definitive standard in sequential illustration without imposing a minimum standard on artistic quality and hence talent overhead trying to impose a specific style like that of lego becomes a stumbling block if everyone cant produce line art on that level of sophistication
2654301 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2654302 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2654303 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2654304 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2654305 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2654306 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2654307 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2654308 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2654309 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2654310 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2654311 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2654312 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2654313 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2654314 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2654315 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2654316 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2654317 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2654318 we had the update this morning from them were obviously delighted and very much welcome the decision theyve taken today to continue here at the olympic games
2654319 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
2654320 people can argue back and forth over who shot first
2654321 if georgian officials request it we will facilitate the transfer within a relatively short amount of time
2654322 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are
2654323 were not talking about anything beyond international diplomacy at this point
2654324 focus into getting our response thought through and then send an envoy into the mediation phase
2654325 its a very localized conflict that appears aimed at threatening the democratic experiment in georgia
2654326 many speculate that part of the reason for the use of disproportionate force is because russia doesnt want to see georgia moving toward nato
2654327 those are some pretty powerful words that are not helping us to end the violence
2654328 how could it be legitimate that any leader in this situation would reject international mediation
2654329 la trilog a cl sica star wars y los elementos de la tragedia griega
2654330 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2654331 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2654332 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2654333 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2654334 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2654335 inside china no news overwhelms bad news kansas city star
2654336 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2654337 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2654338 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions georgia faces a humanitarian catastrophe
2654339 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders

2654343 looking forward to an intelligent and spirited debate between leading pro life and pro choice advocates
2654344 our committee made sure that experts and distinguished personalities from both sides of the fence were invited to the hearing in order to have a comprehensive discussion of this very sensitive issue
2654345 im still hoping we could come up with a reproductive health measure that would address the concerns of all the issues of maternal health reproductive health and population are integral to our national direction and development especially amid the energy and food crises we cant just turn a blind eye to the urgency of this issue

2654347 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2654348 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2654349 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2654353 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2654354 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2654356 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2654357 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2654358 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2654369 im ready to fight everybody everybody who deserves a shot
2654370 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him hes very very tough
2654371 i took the housing portion of the loan moved back in with my parents and started a company
2654372 i grew up in an industry which prides itself on making the world a more beautiful place through providing flowers but that beauty had a price and an unintended consequence because we utilize petroleum based plastics and chemicals to grow the flowers that our industrys customers enjoy
2654373 of all the places in the world i found that the chinese government had commissioned research to develop a true cradle to cradle technology to reduce carbon emissions produced by slash and burn farming techniques
2654374 you try not to step on peoples toes but sometimes it happens
2654375 they destroyed his marriage and destroyed him professionally for a time
2654376 it was a shock that all of a sudden hes a raging alcoholic
2654377 i do not apologize for any aspect of the investigation

2654379 i was thinking how blessed i was to have a kid who has that passion in her life
2654380 the basic message is know your rights and share it with others
2654381 you cannot defend what you dont know it is as simple as that
2654382 this salad is great to take to any gathering it can be served as a sandwich with crackers on a lettuce leaf or in a wrap with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes sliced avocado adds great flavor either in the wrap or on the side
2654383 this is always a treat for our girls when they come home to visit
2654384 miss may has probably had more influence on this town than anyone
2654385 i told my dad that i wanted to be a teacher and he said well ill tell you youll never make any money i said id do it for free
2654386 she was one of the most influential people on my going into teaching
2654387 that has never changed they like for you to notice their new clothes or if youre wearing the same color they are it thrills them to be noticed
2654388 not only are the students learning about the plant parts and functions photosynthesis soil and nutrition but they truly become excited about the vegetables themselves
2654389 from tasting the vegetables i discovered that there are a lot of different kinds of vegetables that i did not know existed that have fun flavors especially the blue potatoes
2654390 the majority of these youngsters have no idea that they have real and important life changing choices in dealing with the food that they eat
2654391 these choices not only extend to the food items but to where and how they are actually grown
2654392 when we sit in the bleachers and see the bureau valley logo up there it says look what this little community has done
2654393 i thought if farmers can do this why cant other institutions
2654394 schools often cut expenses by cutting employees saving electricity was one way not to negatively impact the educational system
2654395 i wanted everyone in the same room at the same time
2654396 the community was excited and theyre still excited were saving a lot of money
2654397 it was a natural fit for what we want to do with the community
2654398 we have a local government organization that tries to take care of itself we were lucky keith was studying alternative energy
2654399 as energy costs rise so will our savings if we have the opportunity to power another building we will
2654400 well save 4 million to 4 5 million over the turbines life without raising taxes thats a win win situation for everybody
2654401 we dont want to leave a negative footprint on the environment for our children
2654402 firing continued for nearly two hours there were no casualties from our side
2654403 the hilly terrain is too tough and when it rains it is blinding and the chopper might have crashed besides there would be very thick clouds over the forest areas reducing visibility to as low as five feet
2654404 empec a tomar antidepresivos y en unas semanas notaba que me pon a cachonda cada vez m s y cada vez m s a menudo al final sent a orgasmos sin parar uno tras otro
2654405 probablemente tengo m s orgasmos al d a que los que tienes todas mis amigas durante un a o
2654406 hige for me this is paradise and it always will be
2654407 long enough to see that youve been working hard to cook me another amazing breakfast
2654408 im sure this will be the best omelette ever youre putting in tomatoes right
2654409 ill just eat half so you can eat a heavy breakfast its gonna be a long day for us
2654410 well youll be needing a whole lot of energy theres the drive to the office theres ayaka and mai theres the board meeting with the international board theres ayaka and mai theres the meeting with matsuuras people theres ayaka and mai then theres the meeting with ken and seito and theres ayaka and mai finally you have to go to the hospital after all those meetings to look after jr so you need to eat more
2654411 well im pretty sure theyll be harassing both of us later i dont know why but i can feel it
2654412 dont change the topic ka chan take that half of a half too
2654413 being the head of this household i demand that you eat that half
2654414 dont be stubborn now ka chan you wouldnt want me to get mad at you right
2654415 here im going to eat this huge half of the omelette
2654416 when aya had taken off running eri hadnt followed immediately wanting to get a message to her family asap not to mention sending out various other e mails to international organizations the u s a government being one of them
2654417 i dont know about the wildlife but were at a latitude of 82 17 south
2654418 definitely the bottom of the world and im not positive but i think were coming in for a landing were slowing down anyway
2654419 but we should get out of here do you think you can walk
2654420 maybe she yknow jumped i mean she did seem a little distant when
2654421 come on eri chan lets get ready for round two
2654422 were in a big round building i think its built around a mine shaft or something theres a straight drop through the middle theres nobody here
2654423 oof sound and then they were both on the ground risa on her back with her arms around eri eri on top of her
2654424 shouldnt niita be jumping out right about now with a flame thrower or something
2654425 maybe she isnt here yet or she didnt expect us to crash so shes in one of the other buildings where we were supposed to land which means we should book if we can get to one of those other planes before she finds us
2654426 do you want to split up we could cover more ground that way hurry things along
2654427 one of those guys is wearing a rockfort uniform looks like a cook
2654428 remind me to blow chunks later after weve eaten and next time we go through there no matches
2654429 about halfway in between this japanese outpost dome fuji and the pole itself in the australian territory and righthere is an australian research looking at ten or fifteen miles tops
2654430 thats great well we could probably hike it if we could find some good gear
2654431 yeah if we run into any locked doors we break em down or shoot the locks maybe
2654432 and its like a one minute walk from here well be flying the friendly skies in no time
2654433 so if theyre still working on it therell be some kind of equipment laying around
2654434 when the coyotes are attacking killing and eating the cats in our barn i personally dont know anyone of intellect or decency that would be so insane as to declaw the cats
2654435 if you support the war then how come you arent fighting in it
2654436 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
2654437 the answer is that you never ever rely on another person for your peace of mind
2654438 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
2654439 i read davids article and i thought he had some interesting things to say but ultimately im looking forward to gordon coming back from holiday refreshed batteries recharged and ready to carry on taking the decisions we need im confident that he can show the bold leadership that we need im sure david will enjoy his holiday and come back recharged and able to play his part in gordons government
2654440 whether there is anything else behind what david said i havent discussed with him but i think having said what he said its probably just as well that hes enjoying himself on holiday and that has allowed the rest of us to get on with the day to day stuff of politics and taking on the tories
2654441 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit i missed a lot of things you know
2654442 a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
2654443 not at all she has a babysitting job in like 40 minutes im going to have to call and cancel
2654444 i really appreciate for the mail in quick aaron guan from luky bunky and whait key same email from different accounts was selling a laptop on craiglist and got this
2654445 there is two things as far as playing football on the field is concerned we defended very well today and we had nothing left in the tank after tuesday it was always going to be a problem but we defended well we really didnt give them too many clear shots at goal chicago had a lot of the ball but considering what happened on tuesday it was always to be expected we lose a rotten goal but matt reis has produced too many saves over the course of the season that we can forgive him chicago is a good team and they had a lot of possession today
2654446 it is tough to swallow because we go out there and play really hard for 82 minutes then we get a red card and were just in here trying to figure out why and how what happened and what we did to deserve that it is a shame were really disappointed
2654447 we just have to take tonight for what it was we came out and played a very good game for 82 minutes giving up one goal would have been alright but the second goal we were just truly disappointed in ourselves for letting that happen going forward it is just one of those things we have to learn from
2654448 gonzalo segares shot knuckled he had a free shot from 25 to 30 yards out i started all the way to my left and then kind of came back to my right id like to have that one back but oh well
2654449 as much as superliga means a lot but at the same time it is five really important and high intensity games in the middle of the season you could see it out there we had a couple of guys that were fatigued but in the end we have to do the smart thing see the game out and win that 1 0
2654450 the ejection definitely changed the game we ended up taking advantage of that situation where we had the 11 on 10 our guys moved the ball pretty well we had a little bit of luck on the first goal but sometimes you need that
2654451 i think we put ourselves in a hole with being behind so early we were a little too casual to start which led to the corner kick new england has been dangerous all season especially the last month all their goals seem to come off set pieces we got behind but i think our guys felt that we were playing well we were moving the ball we werent quite in synch in the final third but we just kept moving the ball and kept having patience and it paid off in the last ten minutes
2654452 we said to our guys we have to make sure that we play 90 minutes tonight its a credit to this group theyve been working hard and they left it all on the field tonight its good to see our guys get the three points tonight because i thought we played well enough to deserve the points
2654453 wilman conde is a big time player he understands what it takes to play in this league and how to play he knew he was at fault for that first goal and he found himself in a spot where he was just alert enough to get in on the end of that play it was a great ball that marco pappa played across tomasz frankowski took a good shot and matt reis made a good save but wilman was there to tap it in
2654454 when shalrie joseph went out i think that gave us a little bit of a boost for the last 15 minutes and we definitely took advantage of that even when we scored the one goal was a long one and the other one was bit of a scramble it wasnt pretty the way we got them but we stuck to our game plan and kept doing what we were supposed to and it paid off in the end
2654455 thats a good sign when were not that consistent with our lineup and formation and things really arent going our way but were still getting results that shows that were a team thats going to be competing whether were on or off
2654456 this was a big win for us on the road we swept them this year and thats huge for us especially in terms of gaining confidence going into the playoffs and potentially meeting up with them again at some point that definitely helps us mentally
2654457 el dinero que se le d el ife reflejar la prioridad que le da a la reforma
2654458 entendemos los esfuerzos hechos por la secretar a de hacienda y cr dito p blico shcp
2654459 tenemos una problem tica y es que de acuerdo a los procesos administrativos de ciertas tareas el dinero se necesitaba antes al no tenerlo en la cantidad que se requiere y en el tiempo vamos a tener que estudiar la forma como vamos abordar en materia de radio y televisi n las precampa as nacionales
2654460 ello agreg porque hay que recordar que stas las precampa as empiezan el 26 de enero y de aqu al 26 de enero o cuando suelten el presupuesto no dar a tiempo de instrumentar el sistema que pudi semos nosotros aplicar
2654461 hay una primera afectaci n por lo que haremos los estudios correspondientes y voltearemos al interior del ife para ver c mo podemos solventar este faltante que tenemos

2654474 el apoyo es visto como tal y es recibido de la misma forma queremos tener nuestros propios medios para defender la soberan a y atacar de acuerdo a nuestros objetivos a las mafias de armas y del narcotr fico
2654475 la estrategia del gobierno federal no ha dado resultados tan es as que el secretario de marina dijo en campeche que seguir n trabajando para darle a la sociedad mexicana la seguridad que necesita
2654476 escala sus capacidades en el combate al delito de privaci n ilegal de la libertad

2654486 nunca pensamos en escoger el mariachi por ser mexicano sino porque nuestra intenci n era tener cuatro grupos de m sicos y que cada uno tocara la m sica folcl rica m s escuchada y popular en cada continente
2654487 lanzamos la convocatoria y recibimos muchas propuestas de mariachis de estados unidos todos muy buenos fue muy dif cil decidir y nuestra decisi n final no se bas en que se trataba de un conjunto s lo de mujeres sino en que por los videos que nos mandaron comprobamos que era el mejor
2654488 yo pens que cuando iba a terminar noche de estrellas me iba a poner como cucaracha en gallinero pero estoy feliz en el aspecto de que logr mi sue o que era ser conductora de un programa nunca pens que fuera uno de los mejores y en horario estelar que muchos productores se pelean

2654500 don chava flores es un gran cronista social y yo la verdad hago cr nica urbana y para m l se me hace lo m ximo

2654511 i already sent him the report and the project for couple of days already but he did not reply
2654512 i wanted to comment on this blog post but after reading all that non sense in the comments i wont tell my opinion be careful if you blog is in english stick with it and dont accept to exclude readers because you can talk another language in this case make your blog in your language or do a second blog for this language only
2654513 click my ads so i can scam you and make money
2654514 it just feels so good to get it off my back
2654515 weve come so close many times today was just our day
2654516 we finished second in mexico and third in montreal i feel like ive been trying so hard to win ive been tripping over myself its a huge load off my shoulders
2654517 we deserved this win this is a big relief for everyone in this room were a team thats been moving forward but we needed this win to justify it
2654518 ini berarti indonesia mengulangi sukses serupa yang pernah berhasil diraih untuk periode 1989 1994 1994 1999 dan 2004 2008 di tingkat asean hanya indonesia dan singapura yang terpilih sebagai anggota ca sedang untuk poc selain indonesia dan singapura ada malaysia dan thailand
2654519 looking at a couple weeks were really fortunate that it was as minor as it was
2654520 theyre thinking and thats totally what should be happening right now
2654521 you couldnt be anything but that so its just time
2654522 theres a lot of stuff we have to clean up our installs slowed down from here on that will help all of us
2654523 he looked like he was lightning fast out here on the swing he caught and turned up
2654524 hes having fun just firing up this team but thats not the right reaction i love the energy out here but we have chances to make good decisions too he can get as excited as he wants he just cant do that
2654525 it sounded like exactly the same thing that happened last year he was carrying out a fake
2654526 well just have to wait and see he said its not as bad as last year the pain was not the same but we dont know what that means
2654527 weve just got to keep chugging along but as the sand drifts through the hourglass weve got to make some decisions
2654528 well just have to wait and see what the decisions are when we have some information
2654529 i mean last year we had a big list of injuries
2654530 i want to make the limelight as a receiver and a punt returner
2654531 i want to make it known im able to do both
2654532 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2654533 even though we thought we had done everything right we still had a very scary moment
2654534 you need to have first responders several people trained in cpr and aeds and the aeds have to be placed properly in cabinets that are visible and can be easily accessed near phones near sports areas all of it needs to come together
2654535 we have administrative regulations in place and we share them with anybody other schools or groups considering implementation that calls
2654536 weve submitted it to our insurance company and theyve gone through it now probably three or four times
2654537 i think the way things are going there could be liability issues if schools dont have aeds eventually
2654538 we follow the letter of the law and take safety very seriously
2654539 orange county for being the county that we are is just really resistant
2654540 it would be a mistake to simply start putting resources in one place or another until weve really thought it through
2654541 im not finished speaking about it because i think theres a lot of things that parents can do
2654542 i had never even heard of aed machines and i have three children i think we just need to be more vocal
2654543 we dont want to do it in a way that is either ineffective promotes a false sense of security or increases our liability exposure and puts the districts assets at risk
2654544 and you balance that against what value is a student life and its not an equation that works
2654545 he that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of doing everything for money
2654546 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2654547 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2654548 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2654549 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2654550 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2654551 but it certainly was a big deal to have all of us on the same birthday
2654552 we had parties but it was just a few relatives there was never anything big or elaborate
2654553 when we were little we each had our own individual cake but as we got older we just had one large one
2654554 we have a blast and we always have good times
2654555 we got together every year but it wasnt always on our birthday
2654556 it has only been the last five years or so that weve been celebrating together
2654557 we all had made other plans during the time of our birthday
2654558 i have a daughter and a son my brother royal has a daughter and stanley has two sons
2654559 the gangway was apparently slippery and mr jeffrey fell between the boat and the dock
2654560 a search for him was unsuccessful until divers from the fall river fire department located him in 15 feet of water about 20 feet from where he fell he was pronounced dead at st annes hospital
2654561 at this time there is no indication of foul play
2654562 the preliminary indication is that there may have been drinking taking place on the boat but were waiting for toxicology reports to determine if that was a factor in the accident
2654563 i think these free tennis clinics help to do something about prevention
2654564 were trying to make a difference to get kids out exercising and learning a sport and having fun
2654565 i believe strongly that american kids have become too sedentary theyre sitting watching television playing video games surfing the internet and its no accident that in the last three decades childhood obesity has tripled i like to use the bristol county district attorneys office as a pulpit to get kids out and exercise more the message is get outside get away from the video screen get fit and i can do that through my love of tennis
2654566 my first year playing tennis i didnt really learn from getting lessons
2654567 i learned from playing with people who gave their time to help teach me the game im coming out here to give back and to help the youth of new bedford learn the game
2654568 they were hitting all the wrong way and now theyre hitting incredibly with just one lesson
2654569 this is a very very good program its awesome i wish it was longer theyre loving it so much
2654570 i think it would be a good way to try it out and see if he likes it
2654571 and they really liked it i wish more people knew about it this is so organized this is excellent
2654572 there were both in the program last year and liked it so we came back
2654573 tay ra plays against the cement wall thats part of the garage and she loves the game
2654574 he hasnt played this year so hes a newcomer too he hasnt had any formal training so this is a good place to start
2654575 its a great sport and id like to see it get more popular throughout new bedford and bristol county
2654576 hereby placed on administrative leave with pay from his position with the murfreesboro police department
2654577 a blood sample was taken from sgt killings by a technician at middle tennessee medical center at 11 15 p m two hours and 32 minutes after the crash was reported
2654578 following its examination by tbi crime laboratory analysts toxicology reports were issued on july 24 2008 indicating that sgt killings blood was negative for ethyl alcohol and negative for the presence of drugs
2654579 based on this information we reiterate that while these bottles are evidence that will be included in the investigation they are not believed to be relevant as a contributing factor to the cause of the crash
2654580 if you look the traffic jams in nairobi you have no option but to walk
2654581 if we dont do anything to decongest nairobi soon i have no doubt it will come to a standstill in a decade
2654582 when you are stuck in a jam you feel a headache you feel disheartened and agitated
2654583 you want to flout all the rules just to beat the traffic
2654584 im sick and tired of this disgusting traffic jam in nairobi every day
2654585 you are never punctual whether yowake up early or not there is always a jam
2654586 if we dont get everything we are looking for in the waiver we would either have to come up with the money through state reserves or we would have to cut benefits
2654587 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement
2654588 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy
2654589 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
2654590 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
2654591 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
2654592 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
2654593 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up
2654594 a bad adviser is going to blow with the wind a little bit more
2654595 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results
2654596 the quality awards comprising three levels a step i award a more rigorous step ii award and a comprehensive step iii award are the most prestigious recognition of quality within the long term care profession
2654597 crawfords step i award shows their dedicated front line caregivers administrators nurses and physicians are demonstrating their commitment to quality of care and meeting the needs for our nations most vulnerable population
2654598 im not going to say that it never gets hectic
2654599 one of the biggest challenges is trying to balance everything so that youre still able to spend quality time with your family
2654600 the main reason i did this was for my kids so that i can provide them with a better life
2654601 i want them to know how important hard work and an education are
2654602 manny is a testament to the sacrifice our students make to pursue their educational and professional dreams
2654603 fisher college remains committed to providing adult learners like manny with the financial resources and services they need in order to complete their studies and compete in the marketplace
2654604 parental involvement in higher education using the perceptions of parents and administrators as the basis for improving institutional policy and practice
2654605 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2654606 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2654607 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2654608 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2654609 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2654610 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them
2654611 the american people are worse off than they were eight years ago
2654612 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back
2654613 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing weve ever seen before
2654614 its an achievement nonetheless to be flat in this economy
2654615 its a consumers paradise right now with cheap fares galore
2654616 the incentives for taking the bus have never been better and it comes at an interesting time with airfares shooting up like a rocket
2654617 people are looking for a simple way to get from point a to point b and in this economy buses are a great way to stretch that dollar
2654618 dont drink and drive let us be your designated driver
2654619 i do almost a report card type thing and there have been no complaints
2654620 no matter how drunk you are you can remember that
2654621 no one can tell you when the aquifer will dry up
2654622 but the trend is telling us the water will not be accessible
2654623 this is the least discussed problem but its the most important
2654624 theres a little bit of water out there and the last drop of it will be the most valuable
2654625 so theres every incentive out there to go and get it
2654626 at the top you tend to have powerful people who do what they want the average farmer sees that example
2654627 now anyone who has the means can access any amount of water
2654628 the technology came to a society with no legal framework
2654629 the deeper we drill the more iron and fluoride making the water less fit for consumption
2654630 you cant change the bucket at one point youve tipped over from credit into debit
2654631 there was a time it used to make me sick but im used to it
2654632 this mexican joint went far beyond some customize able homemade gaucamole and a good margarita the food was exceptional
2654633 online survey gendered experiences of flexible working work life balance
2654634 yo dude i didnt think you were gonna get in he was looking at that id harddd
2654635 were going to be in any way picky about the sausage factor in our bar
2654636 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2654637 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2654638 the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2654639 not going to grow as much as expected but its still going to be growing more than other media
2654640 advertisers have pulled back in a pretty meaningful way and display is feeling the brunt of it
2654641 macroeconomic weakness in the u s and its impact on advertising spending
2654642 continued to experience softness in display advertising from several of our largest financial advertisers
2654643 the old model of advertising you create something and buy the space to put it in just isnt working
2654644 during periods of slow economic growth the last thing an advertiser wants to cut is spending on search based advertising
2654645 what were trying to do is focus in and find an appropriate location in the state of maine that will have minimal impact on the fisheries and the environment
2654646 as we move forward in massachusetts we are similarly moving forward in maine
2654647 there is just a gigantic amount of energy out there and why should we be importing from people who dont like us when it is right there on our shores
2654648 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2654649 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2654650 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2654651 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2654652 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2654653 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2654654 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2654655 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2654656 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2654657 this innovative program provides a financial incentive for cities and towns to actively manage their risks
2654658 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
2654659 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
2654660 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
2654661 i was floored that it was still around i thought it had been scrapped
2654662 we want to have the sea bird running at full speed producing less emissions than a vw bug
2654663 but its important to remember that this is something that has never been done before
2654664 they were keeping their eyes on the towers they wanted those towers
2654665 there were times when the rules of the ocean werent followed by those boats so there was a lot of stress out there
2654666 the ship has such a serious history here in new bedford
2654667 a lot of people just dont know the importance of that ship to the city and how by supplying those towers it helped protect the east coast of the united states
2654668 susan brings a tremendous wealth of knowledge that will benefit nefmas membership
2654669 throughout her career susan has proven herself to be a results oriented marketing professional we are looking forward to a terrific year with her at the helm

2654671 bankfive values its employees tremendously we are all extremely proud of the accomplishments of mrs primo simons we look forward to seeing her applied knowledge in action at the bank
2654672 cheri brings a track record of delivering outstanding customer satisfaction to her role in wareham
2654673 its an honor to manage our retail and customer service activities in a key store like this one
2654674 this new evolution design gives customers the hands on experience of testing out the features of over 55 handsets including the ability to surf our 3g wireless broadband network

2654677 essentially this is a loan administered through the tax code
2654678 i question whether the tax code is the best way to do this
2654679 everything you always wanted to know about your health care but were afraid to ask
2654680 at least i didnt pay 25 million for roger clemens
2654681 oh my goodness gracious of all the the dramatic things ive ever seen roger clemens standing right in george steinbrenners box announcing he is back roger clemens is a new york yankee
2654682 issue my beautiful young and talented friend breaks up with her middle aged pot bellied boyfriend her birthday is on valentines day and
2654683 went to this place based on the stellar reviews perhaps my expectations were too high
2654684 if i lived in chinatown id eat chinese food everyday
2654685 you use the monkey bread fruit if you have a belly ache
2654686 if youre tired you eat the leaves they are good for you
2654687 opening the european market to this product will make a real difference to poor rural communities there offering them a potentially life changing source of income
2654688 ive collected the fruits since i was a little girl with my grandmother
2654689 its better to sell here than there you dont have to wear yourself out going to thies
2654690 now we collect 150 to 200 tonnes of baobab fruit each harvest in the last weeks there has been an explosion in demand
2654691 we are thinking we will need a much bigger harvest next time
2654692 in senegal alone we estimate we could collect 13 thousand tonnes of fruit
2654693 and if it becomes an important revenue the farmers will know that they have to protect the tree
2654694 there are cattle herders that cut the leaves to feed their animals but we are starting to stop them now thats not good because we need the trees to produce fruit
2654695 everybody is asking for our products so they can test them
2654696 last year a customer who left with 8 000 euros 12 200 dollars worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3 000 or 4 000 euros 4 600 or 6 130 dollars worth were happy
2654697 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 euros 76 600 dollars
2654698 yachts of more than 40 metres 130 feet belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre 49 to 115 feet yachts there is a very big drop in numbers
2654699 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening
2654700 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years
2654701 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am
2654702 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer
2654703 people who have a lot of money are ready to spend but they have become more demanding over quality
2654704 when you spend 1 500 euros 2 300 dollars a day on a private beach you expect a high level of service in saint tropez however it has not always been the case
2654705 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2654706 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2654707 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2654708 bernie meant more to me than i could ever describe to you
2654709 how to produce results and a visible impact in a post conflict environment
2654710 there are many constraints and problems here for example corruption but we must focus on the enormous opportunities like the agriculture energy and mining sectors
2654711 to improve the quality of eduction and to increase education access to children
2654712 1 5 billion dollars remains to be used for development projects in the drc but it is necessary to have qualified human resources in the institutions to manage these projects to ensure that the money is used in an effective manner
2654713 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2654714 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2654715 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2654716 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2654717 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2654718 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2654719 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2654720 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program
2654721 such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing we are working closely with chancellor charlie nelms and his new leadership team to examine the various academic legal and financial questions associated with this georgia based program
2654722 since no members of the current executive leadership team were involved in creating the new birth program we can only infer that it was established in order to provide quality educational opportunities for participating students admission of new students to the program ended in march 2007 we are currently developing a teach out option for students nearing degree completion
2654723 for security purposes we cant comment in relation to your inquiry
2654724 you get on the phone and try to think of something else to do but then its like well theres nowhere else ok well go to the mall
2654725 we do scavenger hunts there sometimes as part of summer camp
2654726 and weve gone there for dinner when weve left for conferences or trips its easier to have them eat at the mall where there are 10 places to eat than pull off the side of the road and take 10 or 20 teenagers into a restaurant
2654727 ive seen conduct from some 40 year olds thats less desirable than that of 15 year olds
2654728 it was a civil defense headquarters for officials who were pretty high up
2654729 you had to be able to get in contact with someone down there to get in
2654730 sesungguhnya orang orang yang menegaskan keyakinannya dengan berkata tuhan kami ialah allah kemudian mereka tetap teguh di atas jalan yang betul akan turunlah malaikat kepada mereka dari semasa ke semasa dengan memberi ilham janganlah kamu bimbang dari berlakunya kejadian yang tidak baik terhadap kamu dan janganlah kamu berdukacita dan terimalah berita gembira bahawa kamu akan beroleh syurga yang telah dijanjikan kepada kamu
2654731 but two were from virginia one was from south carolina and of course two union soldiers were found this past year
2654732 we are here to honor american soldiers regardless of which side they were on
2654733 were not just going to change the name but were also capitalizing on that opportunity to put a more public face on what we do
2654734 peggy is kind of an unknown jewel of north carolina just one of the hardest working but most self effacing people ive ever known
2654735 shes held almost every leadership position you can in the academy and every time just done a fabulous job of it and just never says no to work
2654736 people will come to see an exhibit and once they are here they stay in the hotels eat at our restaurants and go shopping
2654737 there are huge festivals such as artsplosure that bring in thousands of people sporting events and the state fair
2654738 by the time i got my bike stopped i just laid on the ground
2654739 a defendant who is the sitting sheriff of this county should know what the law is
2654740 ive gotten to be involved in a lot of issues that do matter and thats why i do this
2654741 and im happy that im not locked in a small room with a telephone trying to raise money
2654742 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that led you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2654743 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2654744 we are getting tired of people not living up to what they say
2654745 i thought he was trustworthy i didnt think he would do this
2654746 people should know that they cant get away with this
2654747 he has run for president twice and lost and now this his political career is over
2654748 as long as it was taken care of between he and his wife it is their personal business
2654749 clinton got away with it but he was already in the white house
2654750 he could never return to the status he was at
2654751 absolutely not he didnt live up to the morals and standards we have for high profile leaders
2654752 its sort of like if he had become the nominee then he really would have screwed us democrats
2654753 both of them theres a certain arrogance that they both must have to think they could just work it out among themselves personally i couldnt care less about it but i care because i want a democrat to win he shouldnt have been that risky knowing so much was at stake
2654754 its an extremely important election so its important democrats dont mess things up
2654755 but i think its wrong for any man to cheat on his wife
2654756 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community or to try to get away from those folks
2654757 freds the kind of guy thats very helpful to friends hes just a big hearted guy
2654758 when i heard his statement i didnt put any black heartedness on fred who was concerned about what these staffers were going through
2654759 this task force just renews the fiery debate on what is the role of psa
2654760 i dont think we understand it enough to write it off and say its no good i dont think its the answer to everything either
2654761 by testing in situations where you shouldnt test and following it up with treatment you actually can hurt people with screening tests
2654762 of those three to five who have prostate cancer certainly no more than one would have died from the cancer
2654763 the other men had prostate cancer under the microscope but it doesnt grow fast we are certainly going to be over treating a number of men
2654764 once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united states used no middle east oil itd have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow itd keep the same policies just look at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always been control control is the source of strategic power
2654765 but gardening is something you have to do if youre going to be effective in foreign affairs come around reasonably frequently and get rid of the weeds before they get too big
2654766 doped with religion and sex and tv for our own good
2654767 the truth is that iran like iraq is a third world nation without a significant military nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country let alone america or israel i am concerned however that a contrived gulf of tonkin type incident may occur to gain popular support for an attack on iran
2654768 time to start categorizing chomsky with christofer hitchens and alan dershowitz
2654769 thats been an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of access the issue has always been control control is the source of strategic power international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from a small storekeeper who doesnt pay his protection money you have to have obedience were back to the mafia principle
2654770 diverting energy and attention away from far more serious crimes
2654771 huge service to the us saudis energy corporations by smashing secular arab nationalism
2654772 in fact one of the last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs theres no military purpose for that the war was over the ceasefire was coming
2654773 gt 060808 apocalypse now the u s and israeli master plan for the middle east part three the annihilation of lebanon mp3 70 disturbing facts about 9 11 that noam chomsky doesnt want to know advertise
2654774 they did a better job of setting up the course today
2654775 you could tell there was a little more moisture out there some on the greens a little on the fairways
2654776 i have to grab the club checked down then well i hit a perfect approach
2654777 almost perfect i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow and well i have to wait but its great to be here
2654778 give a man a fish and hell eat for a day but teach a man to fish and hell eat for a lifetime
2654779 it is good to free people to decongest the prisons but we deplore the fact that the measure is marred by discrimination
2654780 the peace agreement has failed to silence the guns and the people of eastern congo continue to suffer and to run for their lives
2654781 the parties to the agreement must urgently redouble their efforts to act on the commitments they made to protect civilians
2654782 the peace agreement has failed to silence the guns and the people of eastern congo continue to suffer and to run for their lives
2654783 the parties to the agreement must urgently redouble their efforts to act on the commitments they made to protect civilians
2654784 the leaders of the government and the armed groups met in goma and said they would bring us peace but instead they kept fighting we are losing hope we just want peace so we can go home
2654785 it is a so serious a situation that justice must do its work
2654786 we found 72 cases of sexual violence including four rapes of expectant mothers which caused miscarriages as well as torture and serious injuries to men these are the results of our examinations but for what reason
2654787 with these examinations testimonies and statements collected we are now ready to start the military tribunal so that justice can be done
2654788 muk na satu muk na satu i am hungry i am hungry in kituba
2654789 our approach consists of providing shelter for children with difficulties to stabilise them before finding an appropriate solution whether social or family reintegration
2654790 support to activities of prevention of recruitment of children and the reintegration of children affected by armed conflicts in the drc
2654791 the fate of children is a major challenge for the peace and security of a country the question of reintegration and rehabilitation is essential to avoid their re mobilisation in the future
2654792 unicef estimates that 3 000 children are still in armed forces and groups in the east of the country and we see the recruitment of children every day
2654793 preferably we would like to return the children to school so that social loss is minimised unfortunately they have often lost too many years and school reintegration is no longer possible in these cases we help them to learn a practical trade
2654794 pareco and mai mai mongol combatants many of whom are untrained and poorly equipped held the area from december to march supported by fdlr combatants
2654795 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works
2654796 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
2654797 hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus
2654798 pastoral road map for the catholic church in the americas
2654799 the gospel was proclaimed by presenting the virgin mary as its highest realization
2654800 must give a clear priority to prayerful reflection on sacred scripture by all the faithful
2654801 the journey of christian initiation comes to completion and reaches its summit in the eucharist which fully incorporates the baptized into the body of christ 104
2654802 these sacraments are an excellent opportunity for an effective evangelization and catechesis
2654803 to give the sunday eucharistic celebration new strength as the source and summit of the churchs life
2654804 there is a need to accompany children in their encounter with christ from baptism to first communion since they are part of the living community of faith hope and love
2654805 that catholic christians pastors and faithful foster cooperation between christians of the different confessions in the name of the gospel in response to the cry of the poor by the promotion of justice
2654806 the church in america must be constantly concerned to provide for the effective evangelization of those recent arrivals who do not yet know christ 238
2654807 the new and unique situation in which the world and the church find themselves at the threshold of the third millennium
2654808 this mission has become particularly urgent today in america five hundred years after the first evangelization
2654809 my zeal hath consumed me because mine enemies have forgotten thy words
2654810 thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loveth it
2654811 i am small and despised yet do not i forget thy precepts
2654812 while we are grieving there is a hope that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
2654813 mosca vuole la guerra stati uniti ed europa ci aiutino prima che muoiano altri innocenti
2654814 paura e tanto dispiacere per la gente che muore gente comune che non centra niente ho amici in russia e i rapporti non cambieranno la gente non centra con la guerra sono i politici i responsabili
2654815 siamo stati attaccati ingiustamente siamo stati aggrediti la russia dovrebbe fare la pace invece fa la guerra e questo tutto il mondo lo sa lo sa la nato lo sa lunione europea i russi hanno ancora una mentalit comunista agiscono con la forza sempre invadendo
2654816 lo sa che cosa facevano i russi negli anni scorsi ci provocavano mandando in giro banditi osseti esplodevano bombe nelle case veniva la notte e in giro cominciavano a sparare a tbilisi non si poteva stare tranquilli per la georgia un paese indipendente democratico e non cambier gli usa sono dalla nostra parte lunione europea pure
2654817 lo spero a loro non piace vederci dentro leuropa e dentro la nato ma la nostra strada questa sappiamo che per noi impossibile fare la guerra alla russia siamo nel 2008 che guerra vuoi fare ma non si pu accettare la ragione della forza mi auguro che si trovi una soluzione prima che muoiano altri innocenti e senza che la georgia sia costretta a cambiare le sue strategie di paese pacifico che vuole progredire e mettersi al passo con tutta leuropa

2654825 i like that the animals are in more of a natural habitat
2654826 there are more animals here when you go to a zoo they have like two giraffes here theres a lot more and you get closer to the animals the rhino came right up to our car
2654827 the kids can enjoy seeing the animals from the car and listening to the audio
2654828 if it takes flair to do it ill do it
2654829 hes totally different than any other mayor of birmingham ive ever seen
2654830 most of the previous mayors have been conservative in their style like business people trying to govern a coporate entity his erratic style just doesnt fit
2654831 this city has all the potential in the world its time to do something in this town
2654832 hes a good promoter but you have to act on facts
2654833 hes doing a great job hes willing to do the things to put together a plan to move this city forward
2654834 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2654835 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2654836 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is in a state of total military aggression
2654837 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2654838 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2654839 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2654840 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2654841 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2654842 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2654843 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2654844 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone including the bombing of the upper kodori valley
2654845 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2654846 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2654847 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2654848 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2654849 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2654850 i ask sir what is the militia it is the whole people

2654854 we are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today
2654855 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2654856 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2654857 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2654858 it is going to be a festive setting for athletic events
2654859 this belongs to the community and we want to make sure they can touch and feel all of it
2654860 its got such dedicated fans it has to be a wonderful trail
2654861 we didnt buy our house because of the prairie path but we have come to know what a joy it was to have it nearby
2654862 we have seen all sorts of activities on the prairie path it gets a lot of use all of it positive
2654863 its been very rewarding to see how important the prairie path has become because trails werent really a big deal when we got started
2654864 but nowadays its extremely important in this age of air pollution and congestion and getting people around
2654865 just the other day i was riding and i had to stop because a fawn was nursing in the middle of the trail where else are you going to see that and if i run out of water or an energy bar ill ride through a town a few miles later its just great
2654866 may watts spoke at my garden club shortly after the letter was published and she was getting a little famous from it
2654867 we consider the publication of the letter the birth of the prairie path thats when everyone started working on it anyway
2654868 word on the prairie path maybe thats how they find us
2654869 we dont have really big signs so id say the prairie path helps a lot
2654870 thats one of the long term visions if you will of the forest preserve to provide the linkage to the forest preserves and connectivity to the communities as well
2654871 right now you can go from a forest preserve in elmhurst to one in warrenville without ever going on roads and the prairie path serves as that link
2654872 they couldnt take it away now its too big a part of the city its that way for a lot of people
2654873 embarazos de las celebridades en verano gwen stefani ashlee simpson jennifer garner y minnie driver
2654874 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2654875 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2654876 enormous agenda over the next three years to make sure its business was in the best possible shape for whatever transactions were available to it
2654877 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told channel 9
2654878 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2654879 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2654880 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2654881 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2654882 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty he said
2654883 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2654884 we already knew the mushroom could impede the development of cancer by affecting the immune system the in vitro trials we have done show that it attacks the cancer cells directly
2654885 these results give rise to hope about developing medication to treat prostate cancer
2654886 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2654887 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2654888 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2654889 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2654890 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2654891 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2654892 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2654893 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2654894 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2654895 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2654896 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2654897 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2654898 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2654899 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2654900 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2654901 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2654902 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2654903 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2654904 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2654908 ninety nine percent of everything in the constitution is to restrict the federal government its not to restrain the people and yet today the people are being restrained and the government isnt restrained and the people no longer have their privacy and the government has all the secrecy
2654909 if you give up one part of the constitution you give up the whole thing because it becomes arbitrary for the executive branch and the judicial branch and the legislative branch and thats where we are we are an arbitrary government today the government does what they please with no restraint
2654910 there is only one thing the constitution and freedom that brings people together and its not divisive we are not confrontational and were very tolerant of other peoples views thats why individuals can come no matter what views they have
2654911 who is going to pay for that the taxpayer will pay for that the people in the financial markets that took all these risks they are getting bailed out i think the average guy knows a lot more about that than anybody gives them credit for

2654923 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2654924 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2654925 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out

2654945 es gibt ganz bestimmt wichtigeres als rauchern das rauchen zu gew hren
2654946 i am asthmatic and i used a preparation to treat myself not as a dpoing agent
2654947 in the twelve years i have been racing i have had an aut for a certain product syndicort my old aut which ran out on 29 may related to that medicine the next one related to another product becotide and that was what led to the positive result
2654948 i dont know if i was negligent or if it was due to the doctor
2654949 citysearch has found that local advertisers experience a high click through rate on their videos demonstrating increased user engagement
2654950 i had difficulty on the climb it was better for me just to do one lap so i am fresher for wednesdays time trial
2654951 it was my job to be in the first attacking group then i fell back and i tried to get back in the first group but just couldnt
2654952 theres not one easy part on this course even the downhill is difficult
2654953 with the legs i had today i should have just concentrated on my own race
2654954 but im not really happy about how the race went the plan was for me to watch valverde and for davide to keep an eye on sanchez maybe i should have just gone with my instinct
2654955 winning the silver medal is like a prize in itself ive had plenty of runner up places in my career but this one is by far the best
2654956 bettini was always the team leader but in the finale when i found myself in front i decided to go for it to finish second always leaves a bitter taste youre only one step away from gold
2654957 we saw who was the strongest today and it was samuel
2654958 i had some unlucky stuff go on yesterday and i wanted to come back and make up for it
2654959 its been good racing with the pros there in and near boulder
2654960 its really strong in colorado a lot of good guys there we race the local criterium and you get tom danielson and guys like that guys who should be at the tour it was a perfect lead up to this
2654961 i just sort of made an attack at the bottom of the first climb just to see how theyd react
2654962 and a few guys came with me and we were working well a few other guys came across and so we sort of kept rolling everyone was working quite well together and we just kept working right to the finish and sprinted it out
2654963 but a few guys came across and got the break moving again and got us all motivated to go to the finish
2654964 then it was sort of just whatever you had left for the last 150 meters everyone gave it everything and it paid off it wasnt really tactical just whatever you had left
2654965 and then about 150 meters to go i got zoe fraziers wheel and got around her and sprinted to the finish
2654966 i havent been riding too much i just wrecked about a month ago and broke my collarbone
2654967 this feels really good i was speechless coming across the finish line
2654968 one girl went banuelos with 150 meters to go and then i just went around her i knew i had to get around her she was the one girl i was looking for she was second yesterday and had a pretty good sprint
2654969 i got on his wheel and then i jumped at the 150 meters to go
2654970 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2654971 i knew on the last lap that my chance had gone
2654972 i got stuck behind watching valverde im disappointed but i cant complain the race was very tough
2654973 i told my small team before the race to follow the big countries
2654974 i had no choice i just had to try and follow i took a risk at the end by attacking at the end and it turned out to be the good choice otherwise i wouldnt have the bronze medal
2654975 today the strongest rider was samuel but ive got the silver medal and thats like a prize in itself
2654976 im disappointed but still happy to have been there in the end
2654977 it was a good performance i just cramped in my hamstring in the last 200 meters so what can you do
2654978 when jill and i first started we were planning a very sleek townhouse very single girl in the city
2654979 then she up and sold the townhouse bought this co op and got married
2654980 i feel like ive watched jill grow up and now that shes a mom shes a real grown up
2654981 when tom and i first started working together it was just me and my dog max
2654982 some of the detail was good and some was not
2654983 as i was sketching i came up with that wacky moorish cutout top and jill loved it
2654984 the clean lines of this neoclassical furniture smooth out the dichotomy of jills art collection
2654985 if i could explain why that works id get a great prize from the design world
2654986 they have left burnt out tanks they were firing at us for a long time the retreating georgians left a sniper but the russian troops have knocked him out just now we were shelled again by georgian grad missiles
2654987 this is an overt open attempt to destroy georgia to bring georgia to its knees to put an end to georgias independence
2654988 unless we stop russia unless the whole world stops it russian tanks will go to any european capital tomorrow
2654989 i spent three days in our basement with two of my neighbours
2654990 the georgians were bombing from the air and with grad missiles
2654991 we crawled to a field of wheat a shell landed near me but did not explode another fell in the wheat and set it on fire my robe was burning i could hear girls screaming dont kill me the georgians were rounding them up we escaped beyond the field i came here in a car with 15 people in it my son my husband and my daughter are there i dont know what has happened to them
2654992 georgian soldiers flung open the doors of our houses marched in and destroyed everything women were hiding in barrels of salted cheese to avoid being taken
2654993 they are going from door to door killing a few of us escaped in a car but my brother and my aunt and uncle are still there
2654994 our men have only automatic rifles against tanks he told me he ran into our apartment a georgian tank saw him and fired at our apartment block destroying half of it there are constant firefights i think my brother may be already dead
2654995 all we see is georgia preparing for another war but we wont be alone
2654996 it would be a war of the caucasian peoples against georgia and russia would be obliged to protect its citizens about 98 of south ossetians have russian passports
2654997 stalin divided ossetia between the russia and georgia but you cannot split one heart in two
2654998 we should be reunited like germany was and that means joining russia and if we have to fight for that it would be the caucasus versus georgia
2654999 and it is precisely this that may now be georgias greatest problem that it has unleashed a wave of violent hatred against it across the region
2655000 the west and nato back the revanchist policies of georgia but in the caucasus you cant arm one side to the hilt and expect the other side to take it
2655001 he has walked into a great bear trap it is not that he was unprovoked but it seems he has in 24 hours scuppered all the hard work he had put into pursuing nato and eu membership
2655002 russia has been waiting for this to happen they had put enough of a mechanism in place that if they needed to take over they could do it very quickly they have made that clear they have been making bilateral deals with the government of abkhazia too over exploration rights and cutting off georgian exports such as wine and cutting flights
2655003 there is a massive bombardment that has been going on between the citys north and south said mikhail lebedev of russia today not far from tskhinvali
2655004 it has not been retaken there are georgian troops with tanks in the towns centre and russian forces on their way to meet them
2655005 we were in a village close to the town earlier and saw many civilian buildings destroyed
2655006 estoy muy satisfecho con el desempe o de las chicas si puedo darles una calificaci n dir a 70 principalmente porque he kevin se cay de las barras asim tricas es una l stima

2655008 the lightness and transparency of the fixture is probably its most arresting quality
2655009 ill consider any house on this street except that one
2655010 but the minute clark saw the third floor deck and its views he said lets buy it
2655011 we had every gimmicky seashore accessory a lobster trap as a tv stand sailboat lamps wallpaper with beach umbrella motifs and a palette of red white and blue
2655012 the original house was an effort at what passed for contemporary in the 1970s
2655013 but the exterior definitely looked unbalanced the roofline was uninteresting and the general impression was unfortunately one of an unattractive house
2655014 there are always challenges in architecture and there were definitely some in this project
2655015 even though this house lacked grace its been here since 1979 and now it has a new life
2655016 start evaluating looking thinking dreaming long long before you even have a plan to renovate
2655017 that way youll have time to get over it whether it is bin pulls mosaic glass or whatever it is that you are seeing everywhere and thinking you want
2655018 you dont want to wake up in five years and wonder what was i thinking
2655019 cost more than the car we sent our son to college with
2655020 were landscaping cleaning and starting a recycling program were trying to improve the campus physically and environmentally

2655031 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2655032 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2655033 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean

2655038 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2655039 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2655040 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2655041 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2655042 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2655043 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large

2655104 as a society we tend to celebrate the people who run big companies hit a lot of home runs star in movies and yes even sell a lot of records
2655105 initially we had a very difficult time convincing television people to take a chance on it
2655106 the conventional wisdom was that was that audiences find tv compelling when the kids are struggling with drinking drugs and promiscuity instead of getting good grades staying out of trouble and going to church every sunday
2655107 reaction to runs house has convinced me that promoting the value of family life is what i was put on this earth to do i might have earned my reputation as a rapper but when its all said and done i hope that ill ultimately be remembered for being a good dad
2655108 we need fathers to realise that responsibility does not end at conception they have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men
2655109 we run our household like a business i talk to my daughters every day i talk to my sons im in their life at the end of the day i view raising a family as fun

2655117 he stands accused of having been part of a ring of which us president george w
2655118 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2655119 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2655120 the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2655121 he stands accused of having been part of a ring of which us president george w
2655122 the success in finding these large caches was also due in part by numerous tips from concerned local iraqis
2655123 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2655124 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2655125 enormous agenda over the next three years to make sure its business was in the best possible shape for whatever transactions were available to it
2655126 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2655127 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2655128 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2655129 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2655130 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2655131 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2655132 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2655133 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told channel 9
2655134 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2655135 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2655136 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2655137 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2655138 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty he said
2655139 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2655146 on the nuclear side we are concerned about syrias nuclear r amp d program and continue to watch for any sign of nuclear weapons activity or foreign assistance that could facilitate a syrian nuclear weapons capability we are aware of syrian efforts to acquire dual use technologies that could be applied to a nuclear weapons program

2655187 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

2655220 the great anticipation that awaited the olympics is matched by the anticipation for malware to make use of the event to infect users
2655221 zij zijn de enigen van wie we kunnen leren hoe we kinderen het best tegen ze beschermen maar het is een moeilijke boodschap in belgi kreeg je in de dutroux periode een volkswoede die zich richtte naar justitie en politie naar de overheden natuurlijk moeten die er staan het echte werk moet je echter als ouder zelf doen we willen allemaal denken dat het om seks gaat want dat is iets tastbaars maar pedofilie gaat om manipulatie en controle waartegen je je kinderen weerbaar moet maken en dat is een veel moeilijkere boodschap dan schreeuwen dat de rechters strenger moeten zijn trouwens strengere straffen volkswoede en publieke heksenjachten hebben een omgekeerd effect op de pedofielen die in alles stilte hun gangetje gaan een zware straf kan de obsessie van een pedofiel niet tegenhouden maar zorgt er wel voor dat ze sterkere methodes zullen zoeken om alles geheim te houden en om het slachtoffer te doen zwijgen bijvoorbeeld door het kind te vermoorden
2655222 nee het blijft niet te voorspellen het enige wat we kunnen doen is ervoor zorgen dat onze kinderen een sterk ego een sterke wil en zelfrespect ontwikkelen met zon kind kan een pedofiel geen kant uit en dat heeft niets te maken met gsms opsporingschips of je kind achter slot en grendel houden maar alles met communicatie alan toont uitgebreid aan hoe hij de zoons van vrienden en kennissen in zijn macht kreeg en tot weerloze slaafjes maakte hij manipuleerde de ouders en de kinderen en misbruikte ze soms in hun eigen huis het machtigste wapen van een pedofiel is dat hij kinderen laat vertellen over hun emoties en twijfels angsten en wensen op den duur gaan kinderen hem als een vertrouwenspersoon zien dat is de eerste stap vervolgens gaan ze geheimen delen alan liet die kinderen al eens roken drinken agressieve taal gebruiken en schelden op hun ouders telkens was dat hun geheimpje toen hij hen dan misbruikte was dat ook zon geheimpje dat hij handig minimaliseerde in het hele proces zorgde hij ervoor dat die kinderen niet meer naar hun ouders konden stappen ze gingen het roken drinken en schelden en de emotionele band met alan zien als hun aandeel in het misbruik met zon schaamte en schuldgevoel konden ze nergens heen een kind dat vast raakt in zon web van geheimen raakt daar niet meer uit je moet ook weten dat alan er de meest weerloze kwetsbare kinderen uitkoos

2655229 you think as much as college professors and college professors dont make any money so if you keep on thinking we wont have any money

2655236 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
2655237 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
2655238 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
2655239 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
2655240 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps

2655245 i like to think were making progress whatever that might mean
2655246 certainly the article about the 565 000 account got our attention and were definitely interested
2655247 were taking advantage of what other people are doing not that were lazy but because theres no sense in covering the same ground twice were looking at the depositions weve looked at the court proceedings in the civil case and were still looking for criminal charges that we believe we can bring against whom or whoever or how many of them there are we dont know
2655248 to find out through records and other things whether somebody did something then we know the witnesses to talk to
2655249 some other interesting aspects of this case that i cant talk about right now and im not just trying to stall this deal i think there will be subpoenas and other things issued at some point in time in the very near future
2655250 just the fact that a lot of people squandered a lot of money that they had the authority to squander is not necessarily a crime
2655251 i tell you what if they did it theyre going to get prosecuted that doesnt bother me one bit
2655252 whereas millions of africans and their descendants were enslaved in the united states and the 13 american colonies from 1619 through 1865
2655253 lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
2655254 whereas slavery in america resembled no other form of involuntary servitude known in history as africans were captured and sold at auction like inanimate objects or animals
2655255 whereas africans forced into slavery were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage
2655256 whereas enslaved families were torn apart after having been sold separately from one another
2655257 whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism against persons of african descent upon which it depended became entrenched in the nations social fabric
2655258 whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the passage of the 13th amendment to the united states constitution in 1865 after the end of the civil war
2655259 whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery african americans soon saw the fleeting political social and economic gains they made during reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
2655260 whereas a century after the official end of slavery in america federal action was required during the 1960s to eliminate the de jure and de facto system of jim crow throughout parts of the nation though its vestiges still linger to this day
2655261 whereas african americans continue to suffer from the complex interplay between slavery and jim crow long after both systems were formally abolished through enormous damage and loss both tangible and intangible including the loss of human dignity the frustration of careers and professional lives and the long term loss of income and opportunity
2655262 whereas a genuine apology is an important and necessary first step in the process of racial reconciliation
2655263 whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
2655264 whereas it is important for this country which legally recognized slavery through its constitution and its laws to make a formal apology for slavery and for its successor jim crow so that it can move forward and seek reconciliation justice and harmony for all of its citizens
2655265 now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives

2655276 huge hero who sacrificed 30 years of his life for the palestinian issue
2655277 cristinas idea that only unfulfilled love could be romantic is sad
2655278 her notion that love has to be this complicated and tumultuous tug of war to be real that seems so exhausting to me
2655279 i could really appreciate her seize the day attitude she is so open to life and all of its adventures and all of its quirks and ready to go along for the ride i think thats the most attractive part of her character
2655280 as far as getting into bed with a stranger and all of that its nice to think that wouldnt end like disaster maybe ive watched too many of a amp es true crime series the first 48 to know what it could end up as but i think its very idyllic i think that part of me is that way
2655281 my mom is a romantic person and i think i inherited that from her there are many different ways that you can be romantic theres of course the romance that you have with your partner your love and then theres that thoughtfulness that you have with others remembering what people like and what they appreciate and wanting them to experience it and enjoy it thats romantic to me in a way
2655282 if you need dramatic shes dramatic if you need a laugh she can get a laugh she can sing if you need it shes sexy shes intelligent and that face on the screen she is so photogenic its paralyzing there is no limit for her
2655283 i had kate winslet for match point to the last week of pre production
2655284 i had to get somebody fairly quickly and i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young to play the part she was only 19 at the time but then i hired her and became totally captivated by her
2655285 i return from palestine only to go back to palestine i promise families in palestine that we are coming back me and my brothers in the resistance
2655286 maybe well go back down to the beach and see if we could see him that would be real cool our future president down at our beach
2655287 were very honored that mr obama mentioned us and has eaten here in the past
2655288 its understandable that everyone in hawaii is excited about having someone who was born and who grew up here running for president of the united states
2655289 but this is not american idol this is not voting for your favorite or the most popular this is making an important decision on who should lead our nation
2655290 in a lot of different ways i think theres been an awakening perception
2655291 if men were taking responsibility for their children they would be receiving benefits
2655292 it doesnt take a genius to figure out that if we dont get married well get a bigger check
2655293 if work paid enough youd get a lot more work
2655294 they are being saddled with growing debt that drives them underground to somewhere no one wants them
2655295 if theyre in prison the child support clock keeps ticking
2655296 social welfare policy should be changed so that the man is recognized as an asset
2655297 that would change some of the dynamic in our communities that is so dysfunctional
2655298 the idea is to make it real that this obligation matters
2655299 people are starting to say hey wait a minute that kid has a father
2655300 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results
2655301 how can these corporate thugs just out of the clear blue sky decide to triple my rate for no reason other than greed
2655302 i work two jobs so that i can faithfully pay off this loan and one day own this house and i resent emphatically their position
2655303 when i called to complain and ask them why they didnt deny the charge when we hit the limit they said they do it as a courtesy
2655304 of course the change in terms was snuck in with the usual bill statement gibberish and of course was not read by myself as i am not an attorney or financial specialist
2655305 confessions of a subprime lender an insiders tale of greed fraud amp ignorance
2655306 i was one of those guys who actually felt good about being a subprime lender because i could see that we managed the risk relatively effectively
2655307 now that the entire thing has crashed every subprime lender is viewed as a scumsucker
2655308 the industry has always been largely unregulated and the government still hasnt done everything that needs to be done to fix it
2655309 dont pity employers that balk at 6 55 an hour
2655310 its not about gender race color or culture its about getting safe qualified people
2655311 we tend to see employers list certain kinds of jobs for a couple of months at least
2655312 since sarbanes oxley there has been a high demand for public accounting in almost every area of business
2655313 we are constantly looking at programs and benefits to attract and retain them
2655314 however when a checking account has been compromised you have a real ripple affect
2655315 eventually it will be taken care of but it gets to be a real headache
2655316 you havent paid for anything if all of a sudden you dont get the item delivered to you or it turns out not to work
2655317 paul says either the us government was directly involved with pakistan and other countries in the 9 11 plot and allowed it to happen or helped it to happen or the us government was taken for fools and afterwards covered up their foolishness
2655318 im not some conspiracy guy im a hard bitten journalist
2655319 who in our government failed in their constitutional duty to protect and defend us from these attacks and how can we ensure that such failures will not occur again we must find answers to these questions the united states will remain vulnerable we are not safe and we will not be safe until we can answer these questions until we can call to account those who have failed us and until we repair institutional dysfunctions that contributed to this failure
2655320 crossing the rubicon the decline of the american empire at the end of the age of oil
2655321 a detective story that gets to the innermost core of the 9 11 attacks it places 9 11 at the center of a desperate new america created by specific named individuals in preparation for peak oil an economic crisis like nothing the world has ever seen
2655322 t he truth is that the real story the only story is peak oil and gas and that 9 11 was its first visible manifestation i fight to expose peak oil in part by exposing 9 11 in a way that registers in the public consciousness that is my obligation to my readers and as i see it to my fellow man
2655323 the immediate convening of political economic spiritual amp scientific leaders from all nations to come up with immediate steps to arrive at a crash program to arrive at the best possible and most ethical program of population reduction
2655324 i also felt directed to publish a second book which is an origin press companion to inside job this book is entitled one planet a progressive vision of enforceable global law i saw in an instant that these two books go together one stating the problem in stark terms and the other offering a visionary but achievable solution to the war system the abolition of war altogether
2655325 in times of great crisis opposites often arise together in pristine purity unleash a great evil in one place and its nemesis arises somewhere else knock a dying paradigm off the world stage and a new one kicks up out of the blue pnac ish right the bush administration representing the last gasp of imperialist unilateralism in an interdependent world is perversely teaching us one such isolated truth that firm enforcement of international law is needed in a dangerous world
2655326 donors have a right to remain anonymous i will tell you that 911truth org does not accept any money with conditions attached except that of course all money is supposed to be spent in keeping with the groups published mission statement
2655327 libertarians socialists objectivists communists fascists capitalists or a combination of economic systems can use our hypothetical city factory machine
2655328 the school and socialization systems train citizens in rational emotive behavior theory rebt the modern scientific combination of stoicism and epicureanism this teaches rational acceptance of life and ones self and how to control emotions preventing or correcting emotional and thinking problems early
2655329 when people give up these exaggerations they acquire high frustration tolerance which encourages them to accept not like lifes hardships and other peoples imperfections
2655330 we believe that if you change the way people think you change the way they act and consequently you change their destiny
2655331 john is helping out financially with various aspects of the 9 11 skeptics movement in my own case there are no gifts the money has to be paid back
2655332 john in conclusion of your speech i understood you to say that we could heal ourselves by forgiving the government for letting the terrorists commit the attacks my question to you is what makes you believe this long after 9 11 that the terrorists who committed the attacks werent within the u s government
2655333 ive written several books on forgiveness and whenever anybody talks about forgiveness they always think its like if you have a good excuse then i forgive you like lets say im late for dinner my wifes upset with me and i say but honey there was a fire on the bridge and i rescued a child and she says oh okay thats a great excuse i forgive you thats not what forgiveness is that means she doesnt need to forgive me because i have a great excuse the government doesnt have a great excuse these are murderers the people we really need to forgive are the congress that allowed them to do it because they know a lot of the details and theyre kind of like on the edge and they dont know all the information so finding forgiveness for a government doesnt mean that you say that they had good reasons for it they didnt have good reasons for it theyre killers and theres murderers and theres a few of them theres not a whole lot of them so we want to forgive the whole government because they were fooled just like weve been fooled and for those people we forgive them as mentally ill and we put them away and we make a big show of it i would personally like to even im always out of the box a little bit but i think that i would like to make a big show of it and demonstrate through brain scans the problems with their brains my research in the last 10 years is about brain research differences between men and women and brain research and i bet every penny i have that if we could do live brain scans that these men who run that will have very inactive prefrontal cortex which is associated with people and this is a fact theres people who cant feel happy unless theres violence in front of them unless theyre dropping bombs and let me give you one brief example of that in america i know the statistics there 1 out of 5 boys 1 out of a 100 girls and 1 out of 5 boys is taking ritalin for add symptoms which is an inactive prefrontal cortex but you put em on a videogame with bombs and immediately the brain starts producing more dopamine which is pleasure and their brain begins functioning in a cogent clear way so what happens is these are smart guys some of them some of them arent george bush but theyre smart guys but theyre unable to experience pleasure in their lives without some sort of stimulation and i believe that before anybody could ever be elected to a high authority position that we should do brain scans on their brains make sure that their brain chemicals are normal because these people dont have normal brain chemicals
2655334 many in the 9 11 truth movement think that russell should be its model just goes to show how frighteningly behind the curve people are in understanding how subtle the manipulation and infiltration of popular movements can be and how exacting and unbending our watchdog efforts need to be in turn
2655335 the other part which is even more deceptive centers on agendas like the club of rome and the elites hijacking of environmental issues and organizations to create a cover for eugenics depopulation social engineering and anti development de industrialization programs as well as using
2655336 how does one resurrect the eugenics population reduction agenda which everyone would now associate with hitler in a form where few will recognize it
2655337 its probably the most under appreciated position on the team
2655338 its one of those positions you dont think twice about until you dont have a long snapper
2655339 if we had a long snapper rolling balls back to the punter snapping it over his head
2655340 if we were having to go for it on fourth down all the time people would notice that the long snapper is pretty important
2655341 it gives an opponent more time to get a block point and the difference of a guy getting his finger on the ball and not getting his finger on the ball may be the difference in the hundredths of a second that the snap took
2655342 its an awesome opportunity for me to play more i took it real serious
2655343 i realized that i would much rather be out here working with the guys
2655344 many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington
2655345 theyre made of ribbons and butterfly kisses and wonder at christmas and birthday wishes and a heap of giggles and wiggles and love these are the things little girls are made of
2655346 the secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhazia zone of conflict including the bombing of the upper kodori valley and the ongoing military build up along the security zone

2655348 the new centre will help in providing technology enabled teaching training and in conducting capacity building exercises by facilitating collaboration among universities colleges and r amp d organisations
2655349 presently our institutions are functioning in isolation this fragmented system is unable to produce the kind of result needed for todays knowledge driven economy and socio economic development but the new centre will emerge as a confluence of several streams of education
2655350 this mirrors the wider asia pacific trend where issuance decreased 47 per cent to 28 2 billion dollar by way of 330 deals
2655351 the decline in ipo activity is largely because of the current bearish trend in market condition
2655352 securities and exchange board of india sebi will come next week to inspect our system which is already in place and we hope to launch the future contracts in currency by end of august or early september

2655359 the grand opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games on friday evening came as a big triumph not only for the chinese people but also for the people all around the world especially the friendly countries of the peoples republic of china including nepal
2655360 the four hour dazzling opening ceremony held amidst the presence of over 90 000 spectators including 80 heads of states and the government and over 10 000 athletes from 204 countries and regions depicted how well the chinese were prepared for holding the once in a lifetime olympics
2655361 during the seven years since beijing won the right to host the games china spent 40 billion dollars to build the venues expand transport networks and upgrade other infrastructures the preparation on such a vast scale within a period of seven years could have been impossible for many other countries but for china which has been enjoying a record high rate of economic growth for the past decade it was not a difficult task
2655362 through the grand opening ceremony with cultural shows expressing special traits of the chinese culture of both ancient and modern times the chinese people have sent the entire world a message of their growing economic strength putting aside all the political controversies and pollution concerns raised by the west in the recent months
2655363 indeed the chinese government as well as the people have succeeded to free the olympics from politics not only by successfully holding the opening ceremony but also by being host to world leaders including u s president george bush in the opening ceremony
2655364 the film itself is a remake of the malayalam hit vadakku noki eyanthiram with srinivas and parvati in the lead roles
2655365 i have put in all the necessary ingredients to make it a hit at the box office karunas is the hero the complexities that are likely to arise when a dark skinned man marries a fair beautiful girl are captured humorously i have woven sentiment and sacrifice into the screenplay so that the entire family can sit together and watch the film
2655366 the offer to cast me as the hero came as a surprise and i accepted it only after much hesitation now im sure it will be a success
2655367 the malayalam film was a super hit my role is an important one in the tamil version and i expect it to give me a break
2655368 i was very comfortable with him on the sets and i guess thatll show on screen
2655369 its about the travails a middle class housewife faces during the course of an ordinary day at the end of a gruelling day after being humiliated by all and sundry her identity is questioned since her surname is different in a certificate she produces for a job its thought provoking
2655370 he found my dialogue delivery good on the sets and wants to retain my voice
2655371 noo its a remake i watched the original and the heroine only gets to show her midriff while the hero has a double role
2655372 theres no way i can choose between them i shared a great relationship with all of them and we had a great time during the shoot
2655373 i was a little apprehensive at the thought of performing on dads number but i eventually did it and the result is for you to judge
2655374 we have all had our share of relationships we have been through the first crush mere attractions and mature love this film is a romantic comedy which looks at these relationships through my eyes and what they teach me about love and life
2655375 i couldnt even name my grandfathers film in the same sentence as bah that was a classic it was autobiographical this ones just a romantic comedy there can be no comparison

2655528 not only has microsoft not delivered the ability to read and write open xml in its mac office but at the end of the day apple was the one who delivered
2655529 it has said that the shift to intel has caused its problems and changes in development tools and the file format too but every other major vendor has pretty much managed to get their apps over to intel on the mac microsoft is one of the oldest mac developers out there so its not like it doesnt have experience on the platform
2655530 iwork 08 reads the office open xml files with very high fidelity
2655531 the mac office folks have a ton of stuff they are working on for the next version so its not surprising that you arent seeing full open xml support until they reach that point
2655532 desktop linux still has three serious problems to overcome before it can go mass market
2655533 unfortunately as a lot of travelers know this process sometimes leads to inconsistencies in how the list is checked and how its maintained by the airlines and the result of that is frustration for travelers
2655534 instead of open ended profiling the revamped secure flight focuses on the problem at hand
2655535 the problems with the watch list are still valid and are not going away
2655536 i want to be very straightforward about this secure flight will not do any harm to personal privacy
2655537 its not going to rely on collecting commercial data its not going to assign a risk score to passengers its not going to try to predict behavior its only designed to collect a minimum amount of personal identifying information so that we can do an effective job of matching the traveler to a person whose name and identity is on a watch list
2655538 soa is now seen as a key component in a broad range of fields beyond enterprise it chemistry biology everything
2655539 whether its a traditional payroll application or radio telescope research it makes sharing mapping and transferring data and creating new mashups simple
2655540 if gm orders a phone line from bell canada for example it has to be validated checked tested delivered and invoiced by many people
2655541 so if someone doesnt pay child support they might suspend their drivers license
2655542 the new approach is to agree on a shared contract that meets the needs of the consumers and producers of services and information
2655543 the biggest challenges in soa are coming to those contractual agreements between parties and the processes and change management around that
2655544 so this is a conversation between the consumers and producers systems the consumer says i would like to request this service and will validate the information i provide
2655545 it will then grab and use the service automatically if there is no exceptional condition if there is itll provide a worklist to another interface for human review but all this communication is happening behind the scenes
2655546 theres no imperative to adopt it instead it comes up in it projects after budgets are approved to renew applications or to build new ones soa is almost incidental
2655547 it has done some groundbreaking work providing overarching policies and standards
2655548 but theres no requirement for departments to comply or demonstrate theyre doing it to get budgets approved
2655549 that implies jacking up the house to redo the foundation people dont do that instead they say the next time we develop this application well build a different kind of foundation with more flexible components that can be re used
2655550 the operational costs of application management are significantly higher than they need to be and its more complex to make modifications or add ons to non soa systems were paying for the fact were not getting on board
2655551 future maintainability of systems is a big driver in the public sector and many government organizations are on the hook to respond to legislative changes
2655552 weve seen some aggressive adoption at farm credit and canada post
2655553 the rcmp and dnd are starting to adopt soa theyre already doing it in front line applications and theyre modeling their approach after the u s department of defense which is based on a soa foundation
2655554 they say everything seems to work ok so why spend millions on soa when there are other needs
2655555 in the future the public may say we wont stand for this anymore we want to ensure we know what every service organization in government is doing to the environment
2655556 in the construction industry you engage an architect to design the building so it has a sustainable infrastructure and everything works together but then you engage construction crews to build it
2655557 the traditional way is to look at application suites as a whole design in the most integrated way possible internally within the system and use programming logic that produces tightly bound functions with minimal duplication
2655558 then soa comes along intentionally breaking things down into blocks and duplicating functions so they can work as loosely coupled modules its less elegant but in the end theyre cheaper to put together
2655559 the cabinet system we have in canada is built on the intentional design of silos
2655560 each set of programs is enabled by legislation and statutes and each organization supports a minister whos accountable to parliament for that set of programs natural silos are designed into the system so when you try to apply common technology across departments it goes against the grain it almost comes down to do you want efficiency or accountability
2655561 they can do soa in their own compartmentalized area but they cant get it broadly driven so theyre just stuck in their silos again its like architecting a town district by district without thinking about how the whole town will interact or mapping out the whole community
2655562 theres confusion about it in the marketplace across all industries theres no universally accepted definition so its different from one industry to the next

2655567 this a giant advertising stream that you can target anyway you want

2655572 we know children and particularly teens are engaging in online activities their parents would be shocked to learn about

2655587 its important they understand that were on the same team and weve been through similar circumstances
2655588 we always keep our little lists of guys and he was no 1 on my list of defensive coordinators should i need one
2655589 because there have been a whole lot of good football coaches through here a whole lot of good defensive coaches but this is an opportunity challenge and opportunity are a great combination i believe

2655608 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2655609 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2655610 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2655611 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore
2655612 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2655613 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2655614 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now
2655615 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2655616 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2655617 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2655618 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2655619 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2655620 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2655621 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2655622 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2655623 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2655624 ive been to the olympics once that made my decision easier
2655625 i feel the us open is my best chance to win a grand slam
2655626 i wanted to be prepared not flying back from beijing and starting a major five days later its working out well for me
2655627 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2655628 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title i actually prefer hardcourt more than clay my coach has taught me that he has changed my mind my game everything
2655629 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2655630 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2655631 its the biggest race in australia and to be the first over the line is amazing
2655632 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2655633 i just want to sleep on it and talk to jordan and see how hes feeling
2655634 its just not a normal situation the boys only 16 years old and its easy to say yeah i want to play weve just got to make sure hes 100 per cent ready
2655635 hes just young hes a boy and its a mans game so ive just got to make sure im comfortable in my mind that im not doing the wrong thing by him
2655636 ill have a chat with him over the next 24 hours and well make a decision tomorrow
2655637 i dont think i wouldve been ready for it at 16
2655638 i dont think i was ready for it at 18 so i am sure we will send some blokes at him and see how he goes
2655639 any three wins in a row would be sensational because we havent done that since ive been here at the knights and that for obvious reasons would help with confidence
2655640 many brands are wasting their time money and resources to reach communities in social networks without first understanding that the use case is very different than a microsite campaign
2655641 sure i do the majority of my business correspondence via email and i just bought a book on amazon for my brother in law and my now engaged to a guy she met on match com and im planning a vacation by looking at hotels com and i have to check my bank account status today online and im gonna read that story in the post that my friend forwarded to me and i should donate online today to obama mccain and ooh heres an evite to go to thank event by the river and ive got to update and add some photos to my facebook page and i should read that restaurant review online and ill just go to the client website to get information and that was an inspirations quote i was emailed today and then there was that hilarious video on youtube and here at work i need to place an order through that online catalog and i want to check out the site for that vet that i need to take scruffy to and i should order a film from netflix
2655642 but i dont see how the internet affects my business its not tangible to what i do
2655643 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
2655644 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the uk ive been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
2655645 branding is not about getting your prospects to choose you over your competition its about getting your prospects to see you as the only solution to their problem
2655646 oh i did something similar some time ago ill just copy n paste this stuff into this project and adapt it to my current needs
2655647 appiah essentially argues that even in our unquestionably variegated world of clashing ideas and norms there is a great verisimilitude that transcends imaginary or real boundaries that we seem more inclined to prefer and promote
2655648 ive said we can live in harmony without agreeing on underlying values except perhaps the cosmopolitan value of living together
2655649 his dad was in the same position his grandpa was in the same position and nobody even knows what a whatever commissioner is so hes definitely going to win no matter what you do
2655650 the only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it move with it and join the dance
2655651 while i havent seen any myself either people here say that they exist and i cant say whether they are truly real or not
2655652 we dont want to take credit for something we didnt do
2655653 we helped them prepare themselves to fight terror we helped them to plan operations and strategies and develop intelligence sources thats quite a bit but shouldnt be taken too far
2655654 continues the realignment of plan colombia assistance to focus on institution building and alternative development
2655655 the negotiations with paramilitaries in spite of all the mistakes made not only ended the coalition of illegal groups that attacked the state but gave rise to a process of truth that was unprecedented in the country
2655656 when you have five turnovers you cant win like that
2655657 obviously that opening drive isnt something that we wanted to have happen but theyre preseason games
2655658 we wanted to come out and go three and out three and out that was our goal and obviously that didnt happen so its back to the drawing board as far as training camp methods and keep working on what we need to work on we werent running anything crazy tonight we were running our simple stuff to just get back to the basics
2655659 i dont feel we were where we need to be
2655660 we didnt do all the little things right well work on those this week and youll see a much tighter defense next week

2655663 there is a whole string a list of events that took place over the course of this sorry tale
2655664 this string of events really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the ioc the olympic movement as a whole into disrepute based on this the board made its recommendation that she should be ineligible
2655665 we were able to get a lot of work done today
2655666 we situational drills and some two minute drills it was fun it was good to run around and fly around today the running backs did a good job of running the ball
2655667 we didnt play javarris james and graig cooper that much at all they probably played in about five or 10 plays derron thomas did a lot of good things tonight he ran the ball well caught the ball well and protected well hes the guy that stood out in the run game
2655668 we played them early but then we rested them and treated it like a preseason game
2655669 congratulations to him his first title shot he did awesome

2655673 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2655674 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2655675 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2655676 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2655677 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2655678 the whole event is sponsored by blahblahblah and nike so please wear your nike tennis shoes if you do not have a pair of nikes we recommend you wearing comfortable shoes with no visible branding thank you

2655680 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2655681 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2655691 whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven

2655709 the job of a spiritual friend is to insult you
2655710 a true friend tells you when you are dirty in the face
2655711 pemas statement has faulty logic she said the violence was a culmination after hate then more violence manifested i believe the right perspective is if ignorance exists then aggression and violence may occur working with our own ignorance is one good place to stop violence working with others to learn non aggression is another way to stop ignorance we have the opportunity to stop the source of violence in our time because we can meditate communicate listen amp learn
2655712 the basic idea is to be rooted in basic goodness and speak to the capacity for enlightenment in others people who have lives defined shaped embedded in tragedy have the resources to work with their basic good i think we can be honest with ourselves and others and can start good communication at any time in any circumstances the simple act of being honest stops ignorance to access the basic goodness by being honest with yourself and others is pretty simple
2655713 this video is one of great simplicity yet extremely informative understanding this is actually a step forward towards a galactic consciousness
2655714 a simple strategy for positioning your firm or product deeply in your target markets mind is a tool called a usp the term usp has been around for a long time the letters stand for unique selling proposition the idea here is to identify and then communicate a concise statement of your firms most compelling offer and benefit in a way that the potential client can automatically answer the whats in if for me question thats all a usp is
2655715 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2655716 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2655717 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2655718 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2655719 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2655720 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2655721 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2655722 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2655723 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2655724 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2655725 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2655726 who are open to doing something on the production side
2655727 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2655728 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2655729 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2655730 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2655731 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2655732 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2655733 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2655734 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2655735 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2655736 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2655737 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2655738 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2655739 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2655740 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2655741 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2655742 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2655743 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2655744 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2655745 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2655746 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2655747 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2655748 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2655749 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2655750 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2655751 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2655752 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2655753 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2655754 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2655755 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2655756 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2655757 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2655758 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2655759 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2655760 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2655761 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2655762 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2655763 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2655764 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2655765 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2655766 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2655767 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2655768 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2655769 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2655770 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2655771 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2655772 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2655773 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2655774 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2655775 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2655776 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2655777 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2655778 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2655779 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2655780 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2655781 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2655782 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2655783 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2655784 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2655785 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2655786 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2655787 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2655788 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2655789 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2655790 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2655791 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2655792 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2655793 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2655794 fishermen who catch the most fish are invariably those who can keep their lines in the water after all having to fuss through a clutter of tools to ready a line just detracts from time actually spent fishing protocols compact multi function fishing tool puts many of the most important fishing tools right at ones fingertips and all into one ergonomic design thats rugged and eminently functional
2655795 original vision of how the relationship was supposed to be
2655796 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2655797 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2655798 we want a story that starts out with an earthquake and works its way up to a climax
2655799 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2655800 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2655801 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2655802 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2655803 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2655804 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2655805 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2655806 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2655807 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2655808 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2655809 x larc en ciel 1999 grand cross tour x larc en ciel 1999 grand cross tour
2655810 its a good way to remember your childhood or what you saw in the grocery that day
2655811 we felt like we could bring it up to the table
2655812 its always been a dream of ours to run our own business and move to florida so here we are
2655813 away from their own television programs their own worlds and video games
2655814 we have two very young kids we have a mortgage we have health insurance
2655815 just the whole process of having an idea coming up with a product creating a product marketing it and having it be sold in one of the largest retailers in the world its just a dream come true
2655816 with a long term project like this morale goes up and down
2655817 i get excited when i see something i can tick off the list
2655818 being outside with the humidity for so long and right next to galveston bay
2655819 the fact that its never really had a hangar has contributed immensely to its corrosion
2655820 were an all volunteer organization we try to contribute as much as we can maintenancewise and monetarily to keep these planes flying
2655821 everyone from world war ii vets to 10 year old kids well find something for everyone theres times when im in there with a toothbrush and degreaser
2655822 were competing with every airplane in the commemorative air force for a restoration grant
2655823 for me this plane is the closest i can get to the greatest generation
2655824 the back of my neck starts to tingle when i go inside and think about what those men did to protect our freedom
2655825 love at first sight cant exist and children who posses dreams of greater things are more likely to be let down by those around them and sway from the path god had set forth for them
2655826 genuine love exist so love at first sight must do the same and children have the right to be whatever it is they please
2655827 hey im dating someone and i think you ought to meet him
2655828 the more you hide yourself away the more people think you have something to hide
2655829 the adrenaline kicked back in and i realized how close i was to throwing the race away
2655830 you are just too tired to be jumping up and down
2655831 you need help to even get out of the boat and you are disoriented
2655832 the buffalo bayou is lush and green especially by memorial park
2655833 i actually really enjoy the business aspect just as much as racing
2655834 its a true race to the midnight sun because at midnight you are racing right at the sun
2655835 there is just a glow in the sky and it never gets dark
2655836 he trained hard for it going solo it is all about you it is individual performance you have to be more prepared than in an eight man voyager
2655837 maybe i didnt give it all i had in 2007
2655838 that was my motivation i went this year to win
2655839 i couldnt tell you if he was married i dont think i could even tell you he was from texas we didnt discuss that many pleasantries
2655840 it was a huge asset to both of us to have one another out there
2655841 last year i didnt have feeling in my fingertips for six months
2655842 the thing about this sport is that no matter how bad it is pain is a fleeting sensation and once the pain dissipates over the next few days you are left with the memories of the experiences
2655843 wanna be on the road to paradise i wanna lover who dont get old
2655844 we have destroyed our own manufacturing base and at the same time ruined our ability to maintain a level balance of trade we are being drained of our money at a horrendous rate that will lead inevitably to insolvency
2655845 i know where to find a cop in anadarko after dark
2655846 he wouldnt hurt a fly but he would sell his grandmother
2655847 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2655848 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2655849 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2655850 all the scents available are above the other sign i heard
2655851 it is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely
2655852 it is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely
2655853 i wasnt my fault friends just keep sending me text messages
2655854 its not technology thats the issue its the disconnected relationships the lack of emotional intelligence ours and theirs
2655855 what the hell are you talking about when you write when you talk when you say it her that what the hell is it
2655856 even god will not be able to save this country in india even if god comes down he cannot change our country our countrys character has gone we are helpless
2655857 ive gone from a life without limbs into a life without limits
2655858 charlie what do you look for in the women you date
2655859 kraut thanks for absolutely nothing whoever the hell you were who gave me the wrong directions but after the first snow falls and the beauty of it is choked
2655860 vamos avaliar se as restri es podem ser impostas a poss veis vetores mec nicos de transmiss o do v rus como vegetais frutas e frios
2655861 vamos ver que medidas os estados podem tomar mas a id ia impor barreiras contra produtos da inglaterra e seus vizinhos esc cia e irlanda
2655862 devemos exportar este ano cerca de us 4 bilh es e o controle dos produtos que entram no brasil e s o provenientes daquela regi o precisa ser rigoroso
2655863 ainda prematuro tomar qualquer tipo de decis o preciso fazer an lises e checar as informa es mas qualquer medida restritiva se acontecer ser tomada entre segunda e quarta feira da pr xima semana
2655864 de modo geral elas s o provis rias e preventivas
2655865 fica cada vez mais claro a necessidade de se construir as pistas de escape no aeroporto de congonhas
2655866 eu n o sabia que a crise a rea era t o grande assim
2655867 whats the harm in a 2nd post in one night
2655868 think about how worse it could have been if he hadnt went to the hill
2655869 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2655870 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2655871 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2655872 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2655873 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2655874 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2655875 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2655876 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2655877 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2655878 there are a couple of things the comedian does and i never ever in a million reeltalktv com posted 8 days ago from
2655879 what was going through your mind during that final lap
2655880 chocolate or vanilla and im not referring to ice cream baby
2655881 i was think how the ending of crime and punishment doesnt get the appreciation it deserves
2655882 not my investment portfolio thats for sure thank you paine webber
2655883 i was trying to figure out whether hermione really comes back to life at the end of a winters tale or whether she was just in hiding thats been driving me crazy ever since high school
2655884 when we found out that these animals were released back to the owner to a yard that they had previously gotten out of we were very concerned
2655885 the strict interpretation of the ordinance leaves livestock out of that
2655886 i will be meeting with the city attorneys office about looking at laws to protect neighborhoods that own livestock against vicious animal attacks
2655887 another pre electoral direct order this time of 1 8 million to mekanika for mater dei maintenance while 64 maintenance staff are kept on at st lukes with nothing to do
2655888 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
2655889 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
2655890 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
2655891 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
2655892 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
2655893 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
2655894 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2655895 that prime time tv is actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2655896 i think clearly in this case its one where the agenda is very clear that they dont want to depict happily married couples in a normal healthy loving monogamous way
2655897 no one is going to bad mouth america in here
2655898 coffee shouldnt be about sitting in a caf for 12 hours
2655899 coffee gets us through our workday its what we drink before we make steel for the rest of the country or head out into the fields
2655900 were trying to push back against the media and those in europe who are anti america
2655901 i dont have to worry about listening to beatnik poetry or some political ideology that makes me want to vomit
2655902 conservative doesnt mean you belong to a certain political party
2655903 the cost to taxpayers would still be a concern any monetary intervention by government in a market almost always socializes losses and privatizes gains
2655904 but as happened with the rtc the public cost could be minimized
2655905 our country has long since abandoned the notion that we should leave crises to be resolved solely by the marketplace
2655906 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
2655907 lance do you take tanya to be your lawful wedded wife
2655908 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2655909 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now
2655910 enormous agenda over the next three years to make sure its business was in the best possible shape for whatever transactions were available to it
2655911 we sold off our power plants so we needed to recover those investments we put in them that we expected to get back over time
2655912 the markets future expectations of prices are based to some extent on the recent price action and congestion in the spot markets
2655913 when i do my pricing i look at the forward curves for natural gas and what kind of prices we can support
2655914 we believe as the transmission issues are worked out and new generation assets come on line these differentials will start to level out
2655915 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
2655916 they blame the media they blame us they refuse to accept responsibility for anything that is going on in that plant
2655917 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok
2655918 there are people who would like to see us leave but on the whole we have very warm relations
2655919 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
2655920 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
2655921 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
2655922 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
2655923 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent to buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
2655924 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
2655925 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year
2655926 we could be going back to dog teams if we cant afford the cost of gas for subsistence hunting
2655927 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told channel 9
2655928 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2655929 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2655930 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2655931 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2655932 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty he said
2655933 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2655934 the georgian noc confirmed the decision was taken at all levels and supported by their government that they would continue their participation
2655935 this reflects the olympic spirit the ioc believes it is the right decision especially for the athletes as it is a once in a lifetime experience for them
2655936 we were informed last night saturday that discussions were going on
2655937 we had an update this morning sunday but we didnt intervene at any stage
2655938 we are delighted we understand the emotions and concerns of the athletes but they are here for the olympic games they are here for a competition they have trained for for several years
2655939 president saakashvili decided that the georgian olympic delegation would remain in beijing
2655940 we are going to continue the competition with more passion and determination
2655941 the presidents wife who is actually in beijing went to the athletes village and she announced the decision to the athletes
2655942 we are going to play with more passion against all countries including russia nothing else
2655943 the updates we have had from both nocs indicates that the spirit is one of participating in sport and all that entails of respect and friendship from athlete to athlete we do not believe there is any reason also to step up security
2655944 while the fireworks were exploding over chinas capitals starlit sky during fridays opening ceremony here georgia was dealing with bombings and explosions in many of its villages and towns gori kareli poti senaki kutaisi bolnisi and marneuli
2655945 we hope that the dove that was released on friday from the birds nest stadium will make its way to the caucasus and restore peace in the region
2655946 i was one of those guys who actually felt good about being a subprime lender because i could see that we managed the risk relatively effectively
2655947 the industry has always been largely unregulated and the government still hasnt done everything that needs to be done to fix it
2655948 this shows couples willingness and openness to the idea of diving into a joint venture with their significant other rather than relying on outside employment
2655949 its an accomplishment that you can both share as part of your relationship
2655950 business doesnt stop at 5 oclock you talk about it over dinner
2655951 we decided to give it six months to see if we liked working together
2655952 weve always found that its the easiest thing to work with your spouse i wouldnt have it any other way
2655953 people often ask us if we were afraid of quitting our jobs and starting our business
2655954 and in actuality we have always been excited at the prospect of starting our own business together because of our work experience and the wonderful business relationships we have built over the years we knew that the time was right to step out and run our own shop
2655955 we try to create time where there is no discussion of anything related to our business
2655956 that time is all about ed and cherie the married couple
2655957 the pilot died when his plane crashed into a jungle near ndundu village about 250 kilometres southwest of jayapura a representative of the association of mission aviation aid group said today
2655958 we will coordinate with the provincial rescue team to evacuate the pilots body the aid worker said
2655959 its quite difficult and dangerous in these conditions we will move as soon as the weather is good he said
2655960 the pilot died when his plane crashed into a jungle amp squo amp squo near ndundu village about 250 kilometres southwest of jayapura a representative of the association of mission aviation aid group said today
2655961 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2655962 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2655963 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2655964 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2655965 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2655966 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2655967 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2655968 the kind of offensive production we got from the top of the lineup is going to go a long way for you
2655969 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2655970 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2655971 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2655972 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2655973 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2655974 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2655975 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2655976 after undergoing approximately eight hours of surgery she is in critical but stable condition at a beijing hospital
2655977 the victims were not wearing any attire or anything else that would identify them as americans
2655978 that they were here in support of the u s team
2655979 i think most of us feel like our families are safe in beijing
2655980 my parents are here and i am not worried about their safety this was one of those tragic and freak events that unfortunately occur and can happen anywhere in the world the security around the games has been very strong and the people of china have been very welcoming to us everywhere we have gone
2655981 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2655982 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2655983 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2655984 they know were here for them in every way possible
2655985 were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2655986 were pretty much going from our rooms to our training site to the venue just not taking any chances

2656054 the ruling parties should avoid politics of confrontation and concentrate on the challenges faced by the country the government should take initiatives to provide relief to the people instead of increasing political tensions
2656055 the president has only two options face impeachment or resign

2656068 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2656069 treasurer wayne swan could learn from the shopsmart website how to provide information that is really relevant to shoppers
2656070 shopsmart also provides consumers a range of money saving and financial planning tips as well as a downloadable unit pricing matrix
2656071 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2656072 the liberal party ran around before the election drawing attention to that now they are trying to run around saying that wed said something different

2656097 parents have to stay here theyve got to sit theyve got to watch and observe
2656098 its not like kids are by themselves they become one team and develop things together

2656105 well we all know whats going on so let me quickly summarize our understanding and what weve learned before i go over the action plan
2656106 as a result i am recommending and i am prepared to if you will
2656107 fans will look at the score and think it was a blowout but it wasnt it was a tough game for a long time that was a huge out if barton gets a hit in the gap and scores two or three runs we could have lost the game that was the biggest out of the game
2656108 we were going to make the batter beat us with a quality pitch and seay got him with a slider down and away

2656116 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2656117 what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats

2656176 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2656177 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

2656186 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally

2656188 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2656189 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2656190 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2656191 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2656192 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2656193 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2656194 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2656195 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2656196 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2656197 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2656203 he was very friendly he said good morning to us and we were thrilled that he was so friendly
2656204 we saw him this morning he was taking a jog on the beach and were able to wave at him in fact charlotte was able to shake his hand he was very very friendly
2656205 hell it was awesome and then i couldnt wash my hand

2656247 today i want to be a prophet once more if international jewish financiers inside and outside europe again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and with it the victory of jewry but the annihilation of the jewish race in europe
2656248 hoss said in his confession that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled the dead jews out of the gas chambers ten minutes after gassing isnt zyklon b explosive highly so the hoss confession is obviously false
2656249 danger of explosion 75 grams of hcn in 1 cubic meter of air normal application approx 8 10 grams per cubic meter therefore not explosive
2656250 proof that gas chambers for the purpose of killing human beings existed at or in auschwitz
2656251 that jews were gassed to death at the auschwitz concentration camp in poland during the summer of 1944
2656252 purposely overstated the number of non jewish casualties at auschwitz birkenau
2656253 estimates of the world jewish population have been assembled by the american jewish joint distribution committee except for the united states and canada and are probably the most authentic available at the present time the figures reveal that the total jewish population of the world has decreased by one third from about 16 600 000 in 1939 to about 11 000 000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the nazis of more than five and a half million european jews in europe only an estimated 3 642 000 remain of the total jewish pre war population of approximately 9 740 000
2656254 our results suggest that large increases in dietary sodium result in physiological deterioration and increased morbidity in male asthmatic patients
2656255 these data suggest that an effect of reducing bone loss equivalent to that achieved by a daily dietary increase of 891 mg 22 mmol ca can also be achieved by halving daily sodium excretion
2656256 while high salt intakes have been associated with detrimental effects on bone health there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions
2656257 but the evidence does not generally relate to foods typically consumed in the uk
2656258 a statistically significant dose response for the index of salt exposure and gastric cancer was also found
2656259 since 1994 the evidence of an association between dietary salt intakes and blood pressure has increased the data have been consistent in various study populations and across the age range in adults
2656260 evidence suggests that high salt intake causes left ventricular hypertrophy a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease independently of blood pressure effects
2656261 there is accumulating evidence that high salt intake predicts left ventricular hypertrophy
2656262 in men with recurrent calcium oxalate stones and hypercalciuria restricted intake of animal protein and salt combined with a normal calcium intake provides greater protection than the traditional low calcium diet
2656263 for the general us adult population higher sodium is unlikely to be independently associated with higher cvd cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality
2656264 although accurate data are not available for children conservative estimates indicate that on a body weight basis the average salt intake of children is higher than that of adults
2656265 the target salt intakes set for adults and children do not represent ideal or optimum consumption levels but achievable population goals
2656266 in 2002 afssa recommended a 20 reduction in salt consumption over 5 years i e to 6 to 8g a day on average
2656267 high is more than 1 5g salt per 100g or 0 6g sodium low is 0 3g salt or less per 100g or 0 1g sodium if the amount of salt per 100g is in between these figures then that is a medium level of salt

2656269 some commentators of the quraan have quoted a narration which states that after being thrown into the fire of jahannam shaytaan will be taken out by allah taala and told that even now if he were to prostrate before adam alayhis salam allah taala will forgive him

2656288 mike the cops are in the room theres no one there
2656289 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2656290 the chinese have done a lot to improve the security situation in xinjiang but the threat in xinjiang is significant so there will be a number of attacks in china during the olympics and after
2656291 but it is very difficult for the terrorist groups to attack in beijing because of the extensive security measures
2656292 we have been appealing to beijing to solve the issue through political dialogue to prevent the situation from deteriorating but they have never taken it seriously
2656293 on the contrary they heightened the suppression beijing should be directly responsible for todays incident
2656294 comment retrouver son chemin en interpellant des gens dans la rue
2656295 today for review ive got the ax micro bluetooth headset from tritton and its a very interesting headset unlike any ive ever seen
2656296 let me say that again i am a media freak i am also a gadget addict a power user who streams downloads plays online games and is generally considered by most isps to be a heavy bandwidth user and a general pain in the ass thus i have used many routers in the past only to have them be unstable and crash even when flashed to latest versions as an example of my normal usage pattern i once had a router crash on me while i was bidding on ebay it reset and made me lose the auction so in response i took a hammer to it
2656297 in love of race love of fellow men and love of country
2656298 you know we cannot do the best social welfare work unless as in this school the two races undertake it together
2656299 we had a fumbled snap on that drive that set us back we got the called offsides on the next play and that was big it moved it back up we converted a couple third downs and kept the chains moving and we made a play to get in the end zone
2656300 its never just one thing that leads to a touchdown its a combination of things the o line played well we made some plays and the receivers made some catches
2656301 we wanted to get him in there early it was by design to play against a very good defense i thought he competed very well
2656302 weve still got to work out some kinks here and there
2656303 the richest person is the one who is contented with what he has
2656304 the executive board took the decision this morning to declare ms thanou ineligible to compete in the beijing games and the executive board also took the decision in their own right to send a firm signal of the moral case that this has brought the olympic movement into disrepute
2656305 these events resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the olympic movement and the ioc into disrepute
2656306 it is funny to me that the most difficult tickets to obtain for the olympics is the hurdles final with liu xiang and every game that we play
2656307 i mean liu has already won a gold medal in athens and he held the world record we dont have a shot at any kind of medal i hope people are not disappointed
2656308 in terms of techniques we are indeed not of the same weight level with the u s
2656309 but we wont give up the chance it isnt so easy to compete with a team composed of the best basketball players in the world the experience is a very precious treasure in life
2656310 so many good teams that we have to play it could be difficult for us to go forward
2656311 yi jianlian has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman
2656312 i dont think they are able to pose any real threat at the games
2656313 there wont be many opportunities to play an american all star team
2656314 i have been waiting for this moment for such a long time
2656315 it wont be easy but it will be an honor and a precious memory one that will last a lifetime
2656316 i drove a cab in detroit but watkins glen worried me a lot more
2656317 a lot of these guys have no clue what theyre doing out there especially when they see a right turn
2656318 nascar drivers throughout the last couple of years im going to go back even as far as 10 years theyve started to put a lot of effort into their road racing because its two of the 36 races
2656319 and if you run the nationwide car as well it could be four
2656320 so theres a lot of good road racers look at whats happened the last eight years in cup races its been a nascar regular thats won all these races
2656321 the biggest thing on the oval is you know back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas
2656322 its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think you know thats helped me on the road courses
2656323 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2656324 watkins glen is a little faster and flatter than infineon raceway but i grew up watching racing on ovals and not road courses
2656325 ive had a good run or two at the glen and im running the nationwide race there saturday to get some extra seat time but i just generally dont like road course racing
2656326 i played for two years starting when i was 14 in rio but a lot of us play brazilians have three sports futbol soccer volleyball and foot volley which is a combination of the two
2656327 im sure the crowds will come as the competition continues
2656328 i wanted to get 4 03 but to be honest i didnt feel so great i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2656329 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding the american flag phelps said
2656330 that was pretty cool i was pretty emotional after that race im emotional excited its a really good way to start
2656331 he competed the whole way and he did really well lochte said of phelps
2656332 he had a great race all the way and im proud of him
2656333 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2656334 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2656335 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2656336 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round
2656337 coming out of high school people were telling me i wasnt this i wasnt going to do this in football just from the standpoint of me being this big
2656338 but the way i look at it im just like mike goodson when i get on the football field its really nothing big to me i just let the critics do what they do and the people who watch fantasy football let them do what they do
2656339 i think if you ask 32 nfl teams where would you play this guy that they would play him at fullback
2656340 he doesnt have the speed the other guys have we need more explosive plays from our tailback position
2656341 fullback you have to block a lot more instead of standing in the backfield waiting for an opponent now i have to go find a defender and lay it on him so its a big difference
2656342 the weight loss factor is something i dont want that to hold him back from being the player hes capable of being
2656343 i think he can be a very good football player for us at the position we have him at as a runner blocker and receiver
2656344 i just dont want the weight issues to cause fatigue to cause injury to keep him out of the practices that kind of snowballs itself if you are not careful
2656345 people look at like i can just wake up one day and lose weight
2656346 once you do it you feel good your energy level comes back but other than that people just think losing weight is something you can do overnight its a hard process
2656347 its two a days so everybody is going to be tired
2656348 the guys who weigh 160 are going to be tired so what it really comes down to is where your heart is everybody is going to be tired
2656349 just because im big thats been my mentality all my life ive been dunking a basketball since i was in seventh grade
2656350 thats been part of my life me being big and people stereotyping me but one day coach may see it and i may have to take the team on my shoulders for a game and it is what it is

2656354 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
2656355 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
2656356 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
2656357 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
2656358 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
2656359 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
2656360 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
2656361 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
2656362 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
2656363 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

2656372 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2656373 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2656374 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2656375 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2656376 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2656385 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing

2656393 es que el patr n es un cabr n que me ha explotado que me ha echado a la calle qu hijo de puta el patr n
2656394 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor
2656395 desde aqu pod is observar los tanques los soldados y a veces sus aeronaves es una amenaza constante pero esta es mi tierra y de aqu no me van a echar
2656396 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante
2656397 obviamente este es el caso de espa a y francia
2656398 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u ong fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
2656399 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
2656400 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
2656401 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
2656402 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
2656403 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
2656404 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
2656405 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
2656406 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos
2656407 es como poner tiritas a un herido que se est desangrando
2656408 aqu cada observador de la onu tiene un veh culo nuevo un sueldo de ocho mil euros al mes los mejores hoteles helic pteros y todo para que qu observan cu ndo nos ayudan somos arrestados y torturados de manera sistem tica y ellos no hacen mas que mirar para otro lado
2656409 la represi n ha aprendido de nuevas formas de tortura menos obvias pero igual de terror ficas como son la ba era la bolsa y el pollo
2656410 los traen en camiones y autobuses desde las zonas mas deprimidas del reino llegan exhaustos y los dejan tirados a su suerte en la costa aunque ellos no sufren la violencia sistem tica que nosotros soportamos tambi n ellos son maltratados por el r gimen absolutista nuestra lucha no es contra el pueblo marroqu sino contra el rey mohamed vi y sus militares corruptos
2656411 lo est n empezando a hacer con los activistas mas valientes que como suele suceder muy a menudo son los mas j venes los violan y despu s los dejan abandonados en el desierto eso para la dignidad del saharaui es algo muy duro

2656450 like many sports motorcycle racing is a numbers game some of those numbers like horsepower figures the dimensions of engine internals and chassis geometry are closely guarded secrets and kept carefully concealed others the numbers which result from those secret figures are almost painfully public every lap even every sector of every lap is recorded then published on the motogp com website and exposed to the full glare of public scrutiny anyone wanting to know just how fast a specific rider rode on a particular lap during a particular session at a given track and to see where they finished a specific race and where that left them in the championship can pop over to motogp com and look it up of course the ability to look at find that information is completely different from the ability to digest and understand it to many people those figures quickly become a jungle of numbers and they end up not being able to see the motogp wood for the trees fortunately the internet being what it is there are a few rare individuals who have an affinity for figures a passion for motogp and the necessary skills to present those numbers in a more digestible form there are even one or two people who from sheer love of the sport then put the result of their labors up for the rest of the world to enjoy ming en cho a software engineer and interaction designer from san francisco she has used her formidable talents to create a motogp stats viewer which displays the results of each race and the resulting championship standings in an easily comprehensible form no longer are you left attempting to do mental arithmetic and juggling results to work out what really happened ming en cho has created a simple yet beautiful representation which helps you understand what went on during the race at a glance

2656489 benzodiazepine receptors are located in many different regions of the limbic system as well as other parts of the brain however researchers found recently that benzodiazepine receptors are highly concentrated in a particular region of the brain called the amygdala that is critical to emotional processing suggesting that this structure may be an important site of their action
2656490 kava has several advantages over conventional pharmacologic treatments for anxiety in clinical settings kava has been associated with better tolerability and lack of physiologic dependence and withdrawal
2656491 kava is generally well tolerated with very few side effects at recommended doses
2656492 anxiety disorders are associated with low vagal control of heart rate and increased risk of cardiac mortality and sudden cardiac death
2656493 moreover improving vagal control prevents the occurrence of lethal dysrhythmias in clinical studies
2656494 it is my opinion based on currently available information that kava when taken in appropriate doses for reasonable periods of time has no scientifically established potential for causing liver damage however as with any pharmacologically active agent there is always the possibility of drug interactions preexisting disease conditions and idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity reactions which can exacerbate the toxicity of any such agent increased surveillance or reports of adverse effects and judicious use of kava derived products under the conditions recommended by the natural products industry would be a most prudent approach to confirm its safety and minimize any risk of liver damage

2656504 how come its the future but we still dont have any hal 9000s or jetsons robots
2656505 machines will be capable within 20 years of doing any work a man can do
2656506 within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved
2656507 once tools get far enough out of the lab theyre no longer ai just common computer science
2656508 it took 20 years to go from a 5mhz chip to a 500mhz chip but only eight months after that to get to a 1ghz chip
2656509 but if it came out five years earlier it would be considered a supercomputer
2656510 the first application of successful ai was in the financial services industry for loan qualifications loan qualification went from one to two weeks down to minutes
2656511 ai tells them when to start cooking and when to deliver marriott tells me exactly when breakfast will be delivered while others give me a 15 minute window thats a competitive advantage for marriott
2656512 maybe we can offset the energy trend as we make appliances more intelligent
2656513 modern languages have roots in ai research including object oriented design c c and java
2656514 the coolest stuff weve done is build a set of exciting tools
2656515 since the jetsons in 1962 they created expectations we failed to meet for over 40 years big ai projects have largely gone by the wayside but you can see effective behavior that solves real world problems

2656530 some will find the idea of american conservatives using foreign bishops to support the interest of a white male hegemony in the episcopal church altogether preposterous what would be preposterous i think is to see the strategic maneuvers of conservatives as motivated by anything less than the absolute sincerity of their beliefs for me it is the methods more than the motives that invite scrutiny and the similarity of these methods to those of corporate culture that has the most to say to readers outside the church what is provincial realignment at bottom if not the ecclesiastical version of a corporate merger this is sola scriptura with a weird appendix matthew mark and mega trends

2656543 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2656544 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2656545 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2656546 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore
2656547 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2656552 the bible communicated the truth the readers job was then to figure out in what sense or at what level of meaning a given text was true augustine puts forth his interpretive or hermenutical principles in his works on christian doctrine and on the spirit and the letter gregory then developed and demonstrated with a great and tireless imagination augustines principles of allegorical interpretation in his moralia the moralia was intensively studied in the middle ages as a model of interpretation and thinking a rhyme survives from the middle ages that seems to have been designed to help monks preachers and students remember the four level of meaning outlined by cassian augustine and gregory litera gesta docet quid credas allegoria moralis quid agas quo tendas anagogia this verse with some license translates the letter shows us what god and our ancestors did the allegory shows us where our faith is hid the moral meaning gives us the rule of daily life the anagogy shows us where we end our strife robert m grant a short history of biblical interpretation new york 1963 more literally the verse says the letter instructs about what things were done allegory teaches us what we should believe the moral level shows what to do the anagogical signals aspects of the spiritual and future realm toward which we are directed
2656553 in this view premodern culture lacked a sense of childhood as a state of human development with its own distinctive character and that lack emerges iconographically
2656554 an idealized picture of the innocent little one that intrudes between their reflections and their experience
2656555 is the belief that morality the tao can be argued for or defended in terms accessible and compelling to any rational person
2656556 whoever humbles himself like this child he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
2656557 premodern culture lacked a sense of childhood as a state of human development with its own distinctive character and that lack emerges iconographically
2656558 humility demands neither that we should submit what is divine in us to what is divine in another nor that we should submit what is human in us to what is human in another nor still less that the divine should submit to the human

2656562 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
2656563 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
2656564 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
2656565 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
2656566 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
2656567 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
2656568 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
2656569 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
2656570 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
2656571 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
2656572 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities

2656588 the joy of sox weird science and the power of intention
2656589 you do notice when youre watching an important game people are praying with such intensity that you dont usually see in a synagogue or a church
2656590 i prayed really hard for just one win and i got eight
2656591 we know there are wealthy red sox fans out there who are into quirky stuff
2656592 we think the heart has a very large electromagnetic field around it
2656593 our theory is that the fans get into this state of high appreciation and create some kind of energy field that impacts the players
2656594 it was a perfect little i dont know what you call it kismet or something
2656595 i go into another state of mind like the games not even happening
2656596 i couldnt look myself in the mirror for about a month

2656601 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
2656602 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
2656603 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
2656604 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
2656605 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
2656606 the olympic truce captures the spirit of the olympics around the games the world should come together to work for peace and speak out against conflict
2656607 i still remained convinced of the great role the olympics can play as a force for promoting peace around the world including the still raging crisis in darfur yet despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure
2656608 at this point it is as if you are sponsoring political and social conflict rather than celebrating peace and unification
2656609 the olympic opening ceremony captivated the american public in unprecedented numbers for a non u s olympics
2656610 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2656611 last year if we were out on the practice range we threw some deep balls we had some pretty routes we did a lot of things that looked good but the guy on the driving range the guy thats nailing that driver 300 yards that goes out and shoots a 95 is not going to win the tournament
2656612 so i think our guys really understand situational football a lot better this year
2656613 a lot of times when we threw the ball deep it was from 40 and back yates said
2656614 so if we can get the ball deeper into their territory we wont have to worry about taking as many shots
2656615 t j knows how first and second down affects third he knows when hes in four down territory he knows when were going to take shots he knows how one play affects the next just like a golfer knows how one shot affects the next shoop said
2656616 tiger woods only uses a driver they say four times a round we were pulling that thing out probably a dozen last year
2656617 hes going to have to come in and learn formations personnel groupings and those sorts of things

2656630 we do not have a lot of details now and are checking the reports saying more than 12 civilians were killed and 18 more wounded

2656723 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2656724 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2656725 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2656726 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2656727 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goose bumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2656728 my family is coming over here and to have a loss like that especially at a time like this when theres a lot of excitement
2656729 it makes you realize how short life is and you have to take advantage of it
2656730 hopefully it was just a random act but its sad to lose someone at a time like this
2656731 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2656732 there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen
2656733 i would i think because there is still national pride there
2656734 you cant let something like this change the way you live
2656735 we do a lot of traveling this is a very big city and there are people who do bad things
2656736 although the law department was prepared to aggressively defend the city against mr askews allegations it was anticipated that the civil suit would have been tried to a jury
2656737 a jury finding in favor of mr askew could have resulted in damages against the city of several million dollars
2656738 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2656739 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2656740 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible
2656741 were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2656742 today was one of those things we got an e mail from wiz this morning saying she was looking forward to coming to the match she said shed be here
2656743 this game was completely dedicated to wiz bachman and her family
2656744 you have to understand what wiz bachman means to usa volleyball she is like the nicest person in the world she is in our family so her family is like our family because they traveled with us and she fought in the 2004 olympics with us and she was my roommate
2656745 he was a great man there arent one or two memories there are a million i could go on for days unbelievable family
2656746 today was one of those things we got an e mail from wiz this morning saying she was looking forward to coming to the match she said shed be here
2656747 this game was completely dedicated to wiz bachman and her family
2656748 you have to understand what wiz bachman means to usa volleyball she is like the nicest person in the world she is in our family so her family is like our family because they traveled with us and she fought in the 2004 olympics with us and she was my roommate
2656749 he was a great man there arent one or two memories there are a million i could go on for days unbelievable family
2656750 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2656751 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2656752 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2656753 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2656754 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2656755 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2656756 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2656757 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2656758 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2656759 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2656760 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2656761 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2656762 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2656763 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2656764 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2656765 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2656766 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2656767 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2656768 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2656769 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2656770 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2656771 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2656772 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2656773 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2656774 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2656775 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2656776 detroits government will ice cream shop scoops up dozens of homemade flavors from chocolate to roast beef
2656777 its hard to win when you have only one hit going into the ninth inning
2656778 i got ahead early and got a lot of ground balls
2656779 i felt really good and the defense was strong behind me
2656780 on the road were much more aggressive and at home we freeze up with four weeks left we know were still in it though we just have to come out and play hard and anything can happen
2656781 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2656782 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2656783 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2656784 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2656785 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2656786 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2656787 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2656788 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2656789 may have been viewed as a green light for aggression in the region

2656801 i was as nervous as i was when i made my big league debut but after i threw the first strike it seemed just like another game
2656802 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2656803 im very pleased with the quality and quantity of this years online blackjack exhibition which promises to be the best one yet

2656822 it is really amazing because no one has ever done it before
2656823 having been in second place after the second day gave us a better feeling of who we had to keep track of for our last races
2656824 so we just paid close attention to who was in the race and focused on those we had to beat
2656825 i would love to see bryan and christina not do this

2656831 dass sie der kindheit berdr ssig werden sich beeilen erwachsen zu werden um sich dann danach zu sehnen wieder kinder sein zu k nnen dass sie um geld zu verdienen ihre gesundheit aufs spiel setzen und dann ihr geld ausgeben um wieder gesund zu werden dass sie durch ihre ngstlichen blicke in die zukunft das jetzt vergessen sodass sie weder in der gegenwart noch in der zukunft leben dass sie leben als w rden sie niemals sterben um dann zu sterben als h tten sie nie gelebt

2656843 many taxpayers are still paying as much as they did in 1997 or more
2656844 the vast majority of my proposed tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum
2656845 the greatest percentage of tax relief goes to the people at the bottom end of the ladder
2656846 a two parent family of four with income of 26 000 would indeed have its income taxes eliminated under the bush plan which is being portrayed as a 100 percent reduction in taxes
2656847 if you abolish the death tax people wont have to hire all those planners to help them keep the land thats rightfully theirs
2656848 ninety two million americans will keep an average of 1 083 more of their own money
2656849 overall the gains from the taxes are weighted toward upper income taxpayers

2656855 hey if you manage to believe in my resurrection based only on the words of others then you have some kind of deep faith you are blessed for having that kind of faith good going
2656856 you are blessed to share in this experience i gave the apostles and some 500 people first hand knowledge of my resurrection they believed in part because the saw and heard me
2656857 but you you have the incredible blessing of believing without being able to see me you are blessed to have to rely entirely on two things the testimony of others who saw me the new testament writers and my touch
2656858 then may treanor turned her back to the president offering her bikinied rear for one of the traditional slaps that volleyball players frequently give each other
2656859 i have no idea if i am even on the right path
2656860 its a mystery well understand it when we get beyond our limiting four dimensions and enter eternity
2656861 what are you doing dont even think about hime that way because youre just going to disappoint yourself

2656872 in general in a deep conflict the eyes of the downtrodden are more acute about the reality of the present for it is in their interest to perceive correctly in order to expose the hypocrisies of the rulers they have less interest in ideological deflection

2656876 profundamente preocupado por las crecientes tensiones en la zona abjasia incluidos los bombardeos de la parte superior del valle kodori
2656877 cantidades muy sustanciales de bajas refugiados y destrucci n en georgia
2656878 han sido incontables las voces en estos dos meses solicitando que se pare esta locura porque no solo no resuelve ninguno de los problemas de fondo sino que al contrario los profundiza no amerita su costo desde ning n punto de vista y probablemente el d a siguiente ser m s complicado para el presidente y para el pa s en general
2656879 no hay se al alguna de que la relaci n de balance entre fuerzas pol ticas y sociales se modifique sustantivamente porque incluso si el gobierno logra un avance de su votaci n su objetivo principal su proyecto de constituci n igual se ver a trabado o su aplicaci n ser a inviable
2656880 se dice que morales obtendr a un 54 o hasta 55 por ciento pero ese 55 por ciento no es nacional existen altas posibilidades de que el presidente sea revocado en entre dos y cinco departamentos hoy sin ser revocado el presidente no puede ni siquiera aterrizar en algunos puntos del pa s
2656881 predecimos que obama va a ganar porque es la culminaci n de la era a favor de las minor as en eeuu pero eso va a generar un contragolpe de los blancos y hasta una revoluci n

2656884 i was worried the last time i lost a lot of my work i lost some big cases people wont touch you they dont want to have anything to do with you you become a pariah
2656885 its a matter of human rights if you believe in something you just do it everything else doesnt matter
2656886 i still had some cases here and there and that kept me through
2656887 im not a member of the pkr parti keadilan rakyat or any other opposition party
2656888 yes in a way it is anwar and i were just saying it yesterday in court
2656889 i have faith in the court system there are good judges there
2656890 it was a silly thing to do after that i wrote to them
2656891 i said dont arrest him that way if you want him in court i will take him to you
2656892 second time round it worked out well i even got an sms from one of the officers thanking me for co operating with them
2656893 in 1998 people were afraid to speak out they were worried the police would arrest them
2656894 now you have the internet views are a lot freer i get people coming up to me telling me they are not scared like before they are willing to speak out
2656895 this case is full of holes for example the police report wasnt even given to me i asked for it in court and they said no so after court yesterday i went back and wrote them a letter and still they said no
2656896 everything is going according to plan we have avoided the koreans in the draw the mood in camp is very good and they are confident
2656897 the archers are now used to top level competition they are prepared to take on any opponent
2656898 why make things complicated might as well take life easy
2656899 the market will be limited but china is working to improve its medical care rapidly
2656900 there is a pressing need for this kind of therapy
2656901 well what if i dont get a job and everyone else does
2656902 what if it takes years to get a great job that you want
2656903 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
2656904 i honestly didnt have the goal to win the olympic trials my goal was to praise god
2656905 whether i need to cry or hit a pillow or go outside and scream after that its over
2656906 i dont allow myself to dwell on pity thats not an acceptable emotion
2656907 i see the doc sometimes up to 15 times in a months time
2656908 id go back and it would be in a different place
2656909 she would mess with the nurses when they couldnt find her heartbeat
2656910 she would finally tell them its here behind my kidney
2656911 they filled my chest cavity with water and floated it into the correct position
2656912 she calls herself a freak of nature because most doctors shes seen have never seen this condition before
2656913 what you read in the textbook is sometimes different than what you see in the real world
2656914 in school they called me the human weathervane because every time i started wheezing it would rain
2656915 i coughed sneezed and farted all at the same time and broke six ribs a few months ago i guess its a talent
2656916 they say ill eventually sever my spinal cord but thats okay ill just run people over with my wheelchair and leave tire marks to prove i was there
2656917 i dont like green jell o i like the red
2656918 i want dr horwitz i want dr horwitz if i have to have my leg cut off i want him to do it
2656919 he held my hand and sang to me while i threw up on his shoe
2656920 i would wake up in the middle of the night and id clean her up and id get her washed up and redressed
2656921 whether i need to cry or hit a pillow or go outside and scream after that its over
2656922 i dont allow myself to dwell on pity thats not an acceptable emotion
2656923 shes someone that gives back to the community even when shes struggling herself
2656924 to err is human and occasionally people do make mistakes
2656925 and sometimes something extremely complex is not examined to the full extent
2656926 that happens everywhere because were such a large system there are going to be unanticipated outcomes and opportunities to do things better
2656927 cutolo admitted it was their fault they screwed up and they were going to put measures in place so it never happened again
2656928 they said he would still be alive if they had admitted him in april
2656929 i dont ever want this to happen to another veteran
2656930 a russian humanitarian convoy has come under fire panic is growing among the local population and the number of refugees is increasing there are reports of ethnic cleansing in some villages the situation is ripe for a humanitarian catastrophe
2656931 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2656932 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2656933 the russian military presence in south ossetia complies with international law and is aimed at enforcing peace as it has been throughout history russia continues to guarantee peace and security in the caucasus the action by georgia contravenes russias mandate for peacekeeping and amounts to blatant aggression russian peacekeeping forces and unarmed women children and elderly have been the victims
2656934 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2656935 one of the elves gave it to me he said it was a boombang i think he kind of had an accent
2656936 youre supposed to be able to throw it and it comes back to you
2656937 thats probably why he gave it to you you know how it is somehow we end up with everything that doesnt quite work right like that mirror that shows what may be in the future but most of the time doesnt
2656938 remember you rubbed it thinking you were going to get three wishes and when the genie came out he demanded three wishes from you
2656939 ugh dont remind me i still have nightmares over that
2656940 no it couldnt i had to give him the last bushel and i havent had any since
2656941 hey do me a favor go grab me that boombang thing will ya
2656942 because youve been sitting here longer than i have pleeeeeeeeease im bushed
2656943 yeah but the elf said when i threw it it would come back to me it didnt say how or that someone would have to bring it back to me he just said itd come back
2656944 aw whatd ya do that for i was having fun
2656945 you should see the goose egg you got back there
2656946 i cant if i tried to spin around fast enough to see it id probably die at least its a goose egg and not a duck egg
2656947 lame cubbs very lame its a good thing you got all that mane back there
2656948 you dont seem to have broken it at all at least not anymore than it was broken
2656949 yeah it came flying from wherever and beaned you one
2656950 no wonder the elf gave it to you its not only broken but its dangerous too
2656951 how come it didnt attack you when you threw it wait a second this isnt some sort of joke is it
2656952 are you crazy id never do that i mean i might do something to make you fall or something like that but not brain you
2656953 maybe you should throw the thing away since it doesnt seem to come back to you
2656954 did this elf say anything when he gave it to you
2656955 not really he just said that hed gotten it from a wager with a dwarf and didnt have any real use for it so thought i might like it he seemed to think something was funny but i figured it was cuz hed beaten the dwarf at whatever
2656956 i dont think ive ever seen him before course half of them wear the same tunic looking thing he had a shield with a bear being attacked by a dragon painted on it im pretty sure id have remembered that
2656957 im going to throw this in the sea so it can go bug someone else
2656958 you threw it why didnt it whack you in the head this time
2656959 maybe you should just drop it over the side instead
2656960 yeah i watched it splash into the water its just floating now
2656961 sweet i guess we dont have to worry about that anymore
2656962 i found this on the beach doesnt it look cool
2656963 telet n 2007 est n todos invitados a este gr n y hermoso evento
2656964 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2656965 words cant express the absolute devastation i am feeling over the loss of bernie a comic genius a great man and someone i am honored to have called my friend
2656966 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2656967 he had such a deep reservoir of talent mac had a way of making everyone in the audience feel like they were family he is irreplaceable
2656968 a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place
2656969 he came from the day when you were required to do more than tell a joke
2656970 he could do the dramatic as well as the funny there are those gifted entertainers like bernie and richard pryor who understood black culture from both sides the happy and the sad he didnt have to be the clown

2656981 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2656982 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2656983 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2656984 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2656985 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work
2656986 when a person really desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream
2656987 partnership and co operation among nations is not a choice it is the only way the only way to
2656988 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2656989 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2656990 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2656991 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2656992 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2656993 having pete rose and rick porcello in the set is significant
2656994 the all time hits leader and arguably the top pitching prospect in the minor leagues threads will have both

2656996 and we believe threads will deliver a great deal of each
2656997 the write procedure operates in the same way as put datum see section 8 2 12
2656998 the secret of living is simply in giving and it encompasses naught but these words and so to go free to see and to be you must search for the two mighty birds
2656999 the cavern you seek is in mount ab initio and the sound of this horn will lead you on the way but tarry a while and await the right day
2657000 towards us you were bound and tis us you have found
2657001 i am called sadness and i am called sorrow and my wings make the ill wind of yesterday and tomorrow and when i kiss your eyes crystal eggs will i lay for the eggs are your tears on that wretched day so may never you call me not even in pain yet fleet will i come like the fast falling rain and into your heart and make you forlorn with two piercing notes from the small crimson horn
2657002 i am called rapture and i am called joy and my
2657003 youve blown on the horn and weve come to your plea but theres naught we can do what must be let it be
2657004 no in each living being there exists in their sphere two more giant birds and the dragon of fear the gorilla of greed the panther of passion the viper of violence and the rose of compassion
2657005 i have one request before my fate calls can you will yourselves down to become very small because now that i know that you must come too its best were together and share in the truth and kiss me again to abide in your charms and stroke your soft down in my weakening arms
2657006 can you tell me the time of the day and all of the worlds we have seen the world of the dove the world of the love and the world of the mountains of breen and what is its color and why its alive so peaceful and fertile and clean
2657007 its much like a rhyme it comes and it ripples away
2657008 its the same as the love and the worlds are together forever and the mountains of breen have always been clean and the color is far velvet green
2657009 good heavens my dear i didnt expect you so soon
2657010 vile its the big rubbish pile who never can find where to land and wherever hell go theres always black snow and an evil falls over the land
2657011 everything here has begun in my head so spin around spin around well finish this plight be gone with your demons and devils of night away with your evil that lies in this place straight away to your own land and leave not a trace
2657012 you must stay a month or a week at the least and well celebrate your victory with a magnificent feast
2657013 now we must make amends we all have just been through a terrible strife and you came just in time and gave us our life so a gift we will give that will be as long as you live that will float in the sky oer your land
2657014 just follow the spiral on my horn with your hand and think in your mind of your own lovely land
2657015 the violet is for the color you wear the indigos for the brilliant night air the blue is the color to go around your head the green is the place where you make your bed the yellow is the one to fashion your sun the orange is the thing to eat and have fun and my blood is red
2657016 please could you tell me a room with a bed for ive traveled some time and i feel nearly dead
2657017 just go up those stairs and turn to the right and there see a man with hair of salt white and hell give you a bed and a place for the night
2657018 we was just wondering what youre all about with that beautiful boat and soft talk never shout
2657019 do you know of a shell in the sea hereabout thats as long as you are and blood red inside and itll take off your leg as quick as your pride and once that you have one you never will sell for in order to find it you must live through hell
2657020 ive come for the pearl a pearl bout as large as a mans fist and bigger and gives peace to who finds it be he white man or nigger and god is my witness that it radiates bliss for ive held one but once and had the privilege to kiss but now the mans dead and he died of old age and the pearl disappeared like a burning book page but before he died he said where to be near and now here i sit as im drinking my beer the pearl is all colors of green and of gold its warm like the sand when the sun has grown cold and it picks up vibrations from all over the land and transmits to the holder be it woman or man radiations of love of mercy and strength and all the secrets of life will be yours then at length for once you have found it you will always stay poor but confusion and sorrow will be there never more
2657021 well it could be a year or maybe ill die here but im feeling brave what better place than the sea as your grave thats where we all started with lightning and storm then tossed on the rocks just a small shapeless form to begin crawling and walking and flying out free with not much progress made as far as i see
2657022 a sharks nose is soft if only by some means work my way up aloft
2657023 caterina caterina as if heralding horns came near what forces came that keep us apart in pair forever and a twisting inner fear if only to brush your lips again and lay with hand on breast to release all emotions in a fiery rush and revel in the flow of your undaunted love and search stillness in your face as you rest why must happiness go like a last flicking spark to have you looking and wandering and groping in a horrendous torturing dark like a facet on a wave which the sunlight will catch and startle your not seeing eyes is it like that to be gone in a flash when before your souls were the skies oh god or whatever rid me of this pain it torments me down to the bone but now i am here and here will i stay forever and always alone
2657024 i am the one im running neck and neck with myself and seeing how theres only one in this race i dont think i need any help
2657025 how can this be true ive found it at last the future is mine and gone is the past
2657026 could it be real ive searched half my life for this thing in my hand and i know it started with one grain of sand but how many years did it take to grow and the power i felt of this i must know from whence came this joy that surged through myself so open and vibrant with no trace of stealth
2657027 i know now im nothing not even a mar compared with
2657028 much inhabited by writers of small histories dictionaries and temporary poems
2657029 sure i do the majority of my business correspondence via email and i just bought a book on amazon for my brother in law and my now engaged to a guy she met on match com and im planning a vacation by looking at hotels com and i have to check my bank account status today online and im gonna read that story in the post that my friend forwarded to me and i should donate online today to obama mccain and ooh heres an evite to go to thank event by the river and ive got to update and add some photos to my facebook page and i should read that restaurant review online and ill just go to the client website to get information and that was an inspirations quote i was emailed today and then there was that hilarious video on youtube and here at work i need to place an order through that online catalog and i want to check out the site for that vet that i need to take scruffy to and i should order a film from netflix
2657030 but i dont see how the internet affects my business its not tangible to what i do
2657031 branding is not about getting your prospects to choose you over your competition its about getting your prospects to see you as the only solution to their problem
2657032 many brands are wasting their time money and resources to reach communities in social networks without first understanding that the use case is very different than a microsite campaign

2657040 i played very well today and the court is perfect
2657041 chinese spectators really like badminton and they know much about badminton
2657042 i am very delighted with the victory in our first game at this olympics
2657043 our players overcame the nervousness in the first set to play better to win the next three sets
2657044 i think the key to our victory is that we were able to put the pressure behind us and just concentrated on our game hopefully we will continue to have good performance in future games
2657045 i think russia deserved the victory because they played better than we did
2657046 we lacked energy after the first set especially in counter attacks
2657047 hopefully we will play better and win games that we need to win
2657048 i had expected a difficult match even before it started ponsana was a very good player
2657049 i used wrong tactics for the first game when i tried to take control of the rhythm with drops
2657050 your presence reminded me of the 1952 olympiad in helsinki
2657051 that was the first time that the new china organized athletes to attend the olympic games
2657052 we are saddened by the incident that happened to the american tourists we are willing to do anything that is possible to help
2657053 the bocog is deeply saddened to learn the tragic attack to relatives to a coach from the u s mens volleyball team and a chinese tour guide i extend our sincere condolence and sympathy to the victims and their families
2657054 a chinese vice foreign minister went to the hospital to express condolence and sympathy minister of health also went to the hospital to make sure everything possible could be done to help the injured
2657055 when the attack happened it aroused our attention i think we are going to strengthen the security in scenic sports perhaps we may add a little bit security check in the scenic spots to make sure that no sharp weapons will be brought in the areas
2657056 to have president coming watch is pretty cool i looked up and saw him waving the flag thats pretty cool to have the president say congratulations
2657057 in front of so many home fans were so happy to score the first victory for the chinese mens beach volleyball
2657058 i know youre an old friend of the chinese people and have been in china many times
2657059 though people around the world glued to their tv sets knew for sure that the opening ceremony of the 29th olympic summer games in beijing would be something different this time around they were not prepared to see such form of extravaganza that left them staring without interruption
2657060 the fireworks were something rare and added to the joys of people from all age groups the colorful fireworks numbering 30 000 came as a brainteaser to many innocent people who have never before been a witness to such form of sophistication to add to the glory of the games u s president george w bush and russian prime minister vladimir putin too spared time to grace the worlds most spectacular sporting competition that had initially started from the greek city of olympia
2657061 this time around china has turned out to be fortunate enough to host the games the chinese have left the world flabbergasted with the pompous opening ceremony at the stadium nicknamed birds nest
2657062 the efficacy with which the chinese have made arrangements for the games reveals the strides it has taken in the development front no wonder that the hard working chinese people have shown to the world how things could be changed for the better if there is determination to move ahead in life anybody who has visited china must have taken fridays grand opening as something that was long awaited and perfectly in place
2657063 it was only till the early 1980s that people around the world used to sketch chinas capital beijing of being far from modernity with bicycles flooding the roads thirty years down the line china has emerged as one of the most rapidly developing countries of the world a visit to xining in qinghai province last year came both as a breather and surprise for this scribe the city is so well planned that a first time visitor is left wondering how meticulous the chinese must have been with whatever they do
2657064 the railway traversing through the tibetan highlands all the way to xining and beyond up to beijing is another wonder for somebody who is little versed with what real development is like going by the well engineered railway track with the investment of whopping billions one can well surmise the rate at which chinas economy is growing
2657065 in the first half we did quite well in attack however after balic got injured we only found a few solutions to score
2657066 the knowledge we gained from our firebrand experience was invaluable beginning with the streaming video website the downloadable playlists the nightly tv show and of course the launch marketing campaign
2657067 dont let your family get shot before you save the whales
2657068 my family is complete i have two wonderful children i live in australia where i am a marine biologist and my husband studies mamal sic existence so why should we not save the world
2657069 we should strive to create a conducive environment for the growth of our children
2657070 the camp reflects our achievements in effectively protecting our childrens rights
2657071 you have to ask them its about further political discussions but its clear that the management abilities of ministries are doubtful it seems as if no one wants to take any responsibility and make unpopular decisions in this situation but elections took place a year and a half ago
2657072 i would like to hope for good news myself as well but we cant exclude the possibility of the figures being smaller than we are hoping for

2657103 montreals fiscally controversial stadium for the 1976 olympics was finally paid off only in 2006
2657104 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2657105 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2657106 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2657107 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2657108 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2657109 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2657110 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2657111 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2657112 hes a highly devoted young man and very dedicated to human rights issues
2657113 he took a great risk by coming here today but it was very dear to him to come here and highlight the human rights abuses being committed against the tibetan people
2657114 yes theres things that other governments would do different in terms of how they would deal with dissidents and protests but one hopes the olympics will give china the incentive to evolve their own approach in a way that will be very positive in the future
2657115 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed the reality behind the hosting of the olympic games and the stories that are not being told
2657116 its important to us to showcase the fact there is no freedom in tibet and they are dying as a result of the chinese occupation
2657117 im always disappointed when the olympics are used as a venue for making these political statements on other issues and for the canadian flag to be used in that way of course im disappointed
2657118 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2657119 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2657120 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2657121 we kissed who moved first i dont know doesnt matter we kissed the pulsing strong and hot in our veins mouths mating lips sliding tongues sweeping teeth and breathing of each other like one being skin on skin on skin all over smooth and bare and it was the most natural thing in the world like breathing like singing
2657122 its a fairly cold air stream so snow was likely in those places
2657123 there was snow this morning it started at about 6am and went on for about an hour and a half to two hours
2657124 now its just cloudy a bit overcast and real dark
2657125 there were a couple of cars that needed to be helped out of the snow
2657126 there is no snow on the ground in town but there is outside of town
2657127 he never left behind the ones friends he made in high school his love of his friends was easy to see
2657128 he tim mclean lived an immoral and godless life just like all other canadians
2657129 i dont know the family or anything im just here to help if i can to make sure those people dont get near the family
2657130 today is going to be my last day before i die so where is this someone youve all been promising
2657131 so there isnt anyone you all lied to me youve tried to get my hopes up over nothing well you can all just leave and let me die in piece
2657132 everybody on board was looking happy and the people outside werent
2657133 they run all the time the buses dont stop people are getting on and off so the doors are always open the traffic is relentless and all day long the sun is beating down on the roof
2657134 save that the holy ghost witnesseth saying that bonds and afflictions abide me or wait for me in every city
2657135 i have no expectation of seeing you again i have every reason to suppose that this is my final interview with you
2657136 that thou art teaching all the jews among kata the gentiles the jews of the dispersion as in act 2 9 apostasy from moses
2657137 in the eyes of the church at jerusalem this was a far more serious matter than the previous question at the conference about the status of gentile converts
2657138 will change the customs ethe the very word used here which moses delivered unto us
2657139 the rites of the mosaic economy the offering of sacrifices incense the oblations anointings festivals etc which the law of moses prescribed
2657140 it was also customary for the richer sort to bestow their charity on the poorer sort for this purpose for josephus ant lib xix cap 6 sec 1 observes that agrippa on his being advanced from a prison to a throne by the emperor claudius came to jerusalem and there among other instances of his religious thankfulness shown in the temple he ordered very many nazarites to be shaven he furnishing them with money for the expenses of that and of the sacrifices necessarily attending it
2657141 if he shaved in the city it was excusable but whether he shaved in the city or in the sanctuary under the pot his hair must be cast and he did not shave until the door of the court was opened as it is said
2657142 he that says upon me be the shaving of a nazarite he is bound to bring the offerings of shaving for purification and he may offer them by the hand of what nazarite he pleases he that says upon me be half the offerings of a nazarite or if he says upon me be half the shaving of a nazarite he brings half the offerings by what nazarite he will and that nazarite perfects his offerings out of that which is his
2657143 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law
2657144 as having four towers from one of which the whole temple was overlooked and that one of the towers was joined to the porticoes of the temple and had a double pair of stairs from it by which soldiers in the garrison were used to come down with their arms to the porticoes on the festival days to keep the people quiet for as the temple was a guard to the city so this castle was a guard to the temple
2657145 to me very plain that the place where the jews were about to kill paul was the court of the gentiles the porticoes being there and that the chief captain came down there to his rescue
2657146 on the north side of the wall was built a four square tower well fortified and strong this the kings and priests of the asmonaean race who were before herod built and called it baris that there the priestly robe might be laid up by them which the high priest only wore when he was concerned in divine service
2657147 upon the north side and joining up to the western angle but on the outside of the wall stood the tower of antonia once the place where the high priests used to lay up their holy garments but in after times a garrison of roman soldiers for the a wing of the temple when it served for the former use it was called baris it may be from
2657148 in order to have knowledge of all things we went up to a castle adjoining to the city which is situated in a very high place fortified with very high towers built with large stones as we supposed for the preservation of the places about the temple if there should be any lying in wait or tumult or enemies should enter so that none might be able to make way in at the walls about the temple for in the towers of the castle lay very sharp darts and various instruments and the place was upon a very great eminence
2657149 was situated at the corner of two cloisters of the temple of that on the west and of that on the north it was erected on a rock of 50 cubits 75 feet in height and was on a great precipice on the corner where it joined to the two cloisters of the temple it had passages down to them both through which the guards went several ways among the cloisters with their arms on the jewish festivals etc
2657150 these he led round about from the wilderness to the mount which was called the mount of olives and was ready to break into jerusalem by force from that place but felix who was apprised of his movements marched against him with the roman soldiers and defeated him and killed 400 of them and took 200 alive but the egyptian escaped himself out of the fight but did not appear anymore
2657151 tharsus gave name to the tharsians for so cilicia was formerly called of which this is an evidence for the most famous of the cities with them and which is the metropolis is called tarsus theta being changed into tau for appellation sake
2657152 i have two children but face no difficulty in balancing work and family having passed the secondary level i got the basic training by the department
2657153 they are very pleasant and it feels good to be respected
2657154 at first look it seems strange to see lady conductors it sinks in slowly and i think women passengers are more comfortable in their presence especially during long journeys
2657155 sometimes its difficult to handle the elderly when they argue otherwise its all very comfortable
2657156 while i was at this resort they had a fruit and vegetable carving demonstration
2657157 no matter whats gone on between us i had to share that with you im going to email you the pictures
2657158 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2657159 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2657160 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2657161 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2657162 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2657163 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2657164 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2657165 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2657166 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2657167 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2657168 it is funny to me that the most difficult tickets to obtain for the olympics is the hurdles final with liu xiang and every game that we play
2657169 i mean liu has already won a gold medal in athens and he held the world record we dont have a shot at any kind of medal i hope people are not disappointed
2657170 in terms of techniques we are indeed not of the same weight level with the u s
2657171 but we wont give up the chance it isnt so easy to compete with a team composed of the best basketball players in the world the experience is a very precious treasure in life
2657172 so many good teams that we have to play it could be difficult for us to go forward
2657173 yi jianlian has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman
2657174 i dont think they are able to pose any real threat at the games
2657175 there wont be many opportunities to play an american all star team
2657176 i have been waiting for this moment for such a long time
2657177 it wont be easy but it will be an honor and a precious memory one that will last a lifetime
2657178 all i was trying to do was the right thing
2657179 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2657180 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2657181 it is marvelous i have never watched a show like this
2657182 on behalf of the costa rican sportsdom i appreciate the audio visual feast offered by china
2657183 we are more convinced about the rightness of establishing diplomatic ties with china

2657188 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2657189 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2657190 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2657191 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2657192 there is a whole string a list of events that took place over the course of this sorry tale
2657193 this string of events really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the ioc the olympic movement as a whole into disrepute based on this the board made its recommendation that she should be ineligible
2657194 how can this be called a harmonious society if its harmonious wed have a right to stay in beijing and attend the olympics
2657195 my friends would tell me before that they could not remember seeing me without blowing my nose
2657196 u s president george w bush playfully pats the backside of u s womens beach volleyball team player misty may treanor l at her invitation while visiting the chaoyang park beach volleyball grounds at the 2008 summer olympic games in beijing china august 9 2008 team mate kerri walsh r watches
2657197 of course sir come right in and ill have some ice water brought right up
2657198 the man down the road said that was heaven too
2657199 oh you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates nope thats hell
2657200 doesnt it make you mad for them to use your name like that

2657206 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
2657207 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2657208 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2657209 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2657210 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2657211 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2657212 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2657213 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2657214 after undergoing approximately eight hours of surgery she is in critical but stable condition at a beijing hospital
2657215 the victims were not wearing any attire or anything else that would identify them as americans
2657216 that they were here in support of the u s team
2657217 i think most of us feel like our families are safe in beijing
2657218 my parents are here and i am not worried about their safety this was one of those tragic and freak events that unfortunately occur and can happen anywhere in the world the security around the games has been very strong and the people of china have been very welcoming to us everywhere we have gone
2657219 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2657220 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2657221 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2657222 they know were here for them in every way possible
2657223 were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2657224 were pretty much going from our rooms to our training site to the venue just not taking any chances
2657225 we go through so many metal detectors every day weve never felt threatened
2657226 i dont think we can yet reconcile that contrast were grieving for one of our coaches its too soon for us to put this into perspective our number one concern right now is for the coach and his family
2657227 after this stabbing happened it is our intention to strengthen security in scenic spots and we may add checks to ensure that no weapons are being brought into these areas beijing is a safe city but we are not immune
2657228 with regard to venues we believe we have sufficient security
2657229 this was an isolated criminal act beijing has been a safe city for a long time and we have reason to believe that security measures are sufficient
2657230 all have said theres a moment where you just stand where were working and are truly humbled at the fact that we get to work in a building that is so teacher friendly and earth friendly
2657231 they are cheaper to own environmentally responsible efficient its the right direction to take
2657232 because of the efficiency of the building we expect to recoup savings
2657233 im excited about seeing kids come into the building and the applications it will have to learning and teaching
2657234 you have the thanks of the entire state of kansas for your lifelong dedication to protecting our nation
2657235 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2657236 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2657237 we enjoy the opportunity to address all nonsence dave bachmann is willing to present in person to the chief editor of the nw herald to provide factual proof physical evidence of said injuries
2657238 ellenm this has gone way beyond concerned voter you sound like you have a real ax to grind
2657239 you can induce the test mode drain the device battery and turn off therapies
2657240 this is something that academics can do now we have to do something before the ability to mount attacks becomes easier

2657246 i wanted to be prepared not flying back from beijing and starting a major five days later its working out well for me
2657247 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2657248 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title i actually prefer hardcourt more than clay my coach has taught me that he has changed my mind my game everything
2657249 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys
2657250 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2657251 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2657252 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys

2657255 im hopeful this will mark a new approach for mental illness
2657256 it should provide a tool to diagnose the condition and test therapys effectiveness
2657257 most people actually become a little generous when the other player sends a stingy amount trying to coax cooperation back
2657258 but players with borderline personality disorder did that half as often they were less likely to try to repair the problem
2657259 the economy is weak everywhere but in an oil economy
2657260 i am frequently asked to help and have been honored to do so and so i think the same has been true for both rich and dan both of them have been generous not only to political causes but to philanthropic causes
2657261 this pine shaded mansion filled dreamscape of folly and ambition is both the geographic and mythical heart of houston
2657262 long an enclave of houstons wealthiest residents river oaks as opposed to say philadelphias main line or manhattans upper east side tends to be more welcoming less obsessed with pedigree and more open to grand gestures and exhibition

2657265 these are folks who are usually proud of their homes and are willing to open them
2657266 some of these homeowners built their homes because they entertain frequently
2657267 some of the homes have already been vetted meaning the president knows it and the secret service knows it and so it is easy to get approved
2657268 its one of those things where everyone in the neighborhood understands the process
2657269 and its probably the most important presidential election in god how many years
2657270 i told my husband there must be something we can do this is throwing money out the window
2657271 were not asking you to recycle cans or go hug a tree unless you want to but with some relatively simple efforts you can save some money on your electric bill each month
2657272 you can use 75 percent less energy by buying the cfls the spiral bulbs
2657273 fans cool people not rooms turn the fan off in empty rooms
2657274 major air leakage is usually caused by improperly sealed doors windows frames wall penetrations wall outlets fireplaces and attic entrances
2657275 crawl around in your attic one day if you feel nice cold air theres a problem
2657276 another thing people dont think about is landscaping as a tool plant as many plants as possible to cover the exterior walls it keeps the heat from soaking into the brick or siding
2657277 look you can save up to eight gallons of water a day if you turn the faucet off when you brush your teeth
2657278 and definitely this year there is a lot more emphasis on conserving energy than ever before im sure its because of the energy prices when gas is cheap its no big deal to drive a big truck not any more
2657279 same thing with the power were paying more for it so we want to be as efficient as possible
2657280 its hard to know why anybody would do anything like that
2657281 so which road are they going to use to drive this stuff on
2657282 san antonio is better prepared with a huge number of federal assets to respond to small accidents and large incidents
2657283 and they found strength in god and the virgin mary
2657284 my parents believed in god but they understood that there are things you cant control
2657285 so the only thing to do is to pray for strength to help you get through
2657286 they went to pray but they also went to socialize to see old friends from saigon
2657287 my father would seek out his former students it made him so happy to see their familiar faces and be among his colleagues meanwhile my mother volunteered and caught up on gossip the gathering bought them close to god friends and the country they left behind
2657288 but she had a will of iron and worked harder than anyone ive ever known
2657289 but she demonstrated her love for us in other ways waking up while still dark outside to make us breakfast and tending to our needs late at night
2657290 mom would pray for her children and 25 grandchildren every morning and every night
2657291 but she was tireless when it came to her belief
2657292 she felt that prayers were her childrens salvation so she was determined to go to missouri
2657293 since that time hes been a very very good father and husband
2657294 we are still putting all the pieces of this investigation together
2657295 it is too early for us to look at just one thing
2657296 it got pretty hectic with people wanting to know where their loved ones were
2657297 it was very poignant your heart goes out to people
2657298 their families have come up from other areas to identify their parents or loved ones it is heartbreaking
2657299 but were not about blaming people were about our faith
2657300 its clearly a pattern of fly by night charter operators
2657301 they start on a shoestring a lot of them are former bus drivers that manage to get a little money together to get some ancient bus
2657302 i dont remember a time in 35 years with this many serious bus accidents with these kind of frequencies
2657303 we have an air crash and its unbelievable the amount of resources devoted to the cause and compensating of victims
2657304 until criminal sanctions are used as an enforcement tool were going to be plagued with this problem
2657305 when you have certain operators just flagrantly gaming the system circumventing safety rules operating without any legal authority criminal actions need to be taken
2657306 the regulations have so many loopholes its like a block of swiss cheese
2657307 if you lose your license as an individual you cant get another license that doesnt work what were doing is extending to corporations and companies greater liberty under the law than individuals have
2657308 we both left the church at the same time but we got split up because our bus had to make more stops
2657309 we know that the other people the victims were on their way to do the very same pilgrimage and they were in very high spirits
2657310 we know the victims are here looking down on us they are more blessed than us
2657311 we were all crying and trying to help comfort the victims
2657312 there was nothing else we could do but continue on with the pilgrimage
2657313 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2657314 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2657315 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2657316 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2657317 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2657318 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2657319 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2657320 hes the first one to really admit guilt so far as to be where theyre at
2657321 it started with his wife im glad he wont be wasting our money taxpayer money
2657322 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2657323 you dont forget it sadly a lot of people got hurt
2657324 we didnt expect that many we only had enough for 12
2657325 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2657326 i removed his pistol and put it in the back of my waistband
2657327 i felt so horrible the depth of evil i fell into
2657328 that whole thing then going gay that was a lie its not true we just had to come up with something it was a big fabrication
2657329 i dont want to hurt my in laws my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2657330 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2657331 it would be a mistake to use mandatory building requirements as a means to force houstonians out of their cars and onto hot sidewalks
2657332 this is the kind of thing weve been looking for for 20 years
2657333 if they want to read up on their favorite movie star or sports figure computer reading is also reading
2657334 but he hated how the potatoes were prepared everywhere he went
2657335 research is showing that if students read five to eight books on their reading level they can show improvement gains equal to going to summer school
2657336 our brains arent supposed to be working in the summer
2657337 advertising the way great brands get to be great brands
2657338 have concluded that the most powerful forum for consumer seduction is not tv ads or billboards but rather the conversations we have in our everyday lives
2657339 is the scripted use of action to generate buzz it is deliberate one of the factors that sets buzz marketing apart from other forms of marketing is the illusion the invisibility of the marketer authenticity is the key driver
2657340 being cool went to gap managements heads and they lost their focus
2657341 when she starts speaking if you lie shes gonna let you know youre lying
2657342 now im also the only one with a masters degree
2657343 i wasnt raised like that my addiction turned me into somebody i wasnt my addiction turned me into a criminal
2657344 my name is rosey and im a grateful recovering addict and im an ex offender
2657345 i was an addict before i was a criminal my addiction turned me into a criminal
2657346 you know how it goes from pawning my stuff to stealing to selling dope to robbing it just got worse and worse
2657347 and i had to learn how to fight this thing up here
2657348 when were on the streets its all about the lifestyle we love the street we love the risk danger excitement and action
2657349 you know it didnt feel good being in your mid 30s and having nothing to show for all your years on this earth
2657350 so i said i have to change and i have to do it now
2657351 theres no question that anyone can do it beat their problems but they need a lot of help
2657352 i thank god i dont have to live like that anymore
2657353 i didnt have a ride or a job and she told me to keep my head up
2657354 its not easy to listen to you if you havent done the time crawled from the bottom lived it
2657355 never forgetting where i came from and remembering where i dont want to go back to
2657356 it would be a mistake to use mandatory building requirements as a means to force houstonians out of their cars and onto hot sidewalks
2657357 this is the kind of thing weve been looking for for 20 years
2657358 we are still putting all the pieces of this investigation together
2657359 it is too early for us to look at just one thing
2657360 it got pretty hectic with people wanting to know where their loved ones were
2657361 it was very poignant your heart goes out to people
2657362 their families have come up from other areas to identify their parents or loved ones it is heartbreaking
2657363 but were not about blaming people were about our faith
2657364 its hard to know why anybody would do anything like that
2657365 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2657366 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence we call for the end of the russian bombings
2657367 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2657368 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2657369 when she starts speaking if you lie shes gonna let you know youre lying
2657370 now im also the only one with a masters degree
2657371 i wasnt raised like that my addiction turned me into somebody i wasnt my addiction turned me into a criminal
2657372 my name is rosey and im a grateful recovering addict and im an ex offender
2657373 i was an addict before i was a criminal my addiction turned me into a criminal
2657374 you know how it goes from pawning my stuff to stealing to selling dope to robbing it just got worse and worse

2657378 so i said i have to change and i have to do it now
2657379 theres no question that anyone can do it beat their problems but they need a lot of help
2657380 i thank god i dont have to live like that anymore
2657381 i didnt have a ride or a job and she told me to keep my head up
2657382 its not easy to listen to you if you havent done the time crawled from the bottom lived it
2657383 never forgetting where i came from and remembering where i dont want to go back to
2657384 im hopeful this will mark a new approach for mental illness
2657385 it should provide a tool to diagnose the condition and test therapys effectiveness
2657386 most people actually become a little generous when the other player sends a stingy amount trying to coax cooperation back
2657387 but players with borderline personality disorder did that half as often they were less likely to try to repair the problem
2657388 the economy is weak everywhere but in an oil economy
2657389 i am frequently asked to help and have been honored to do so and so i think the same has been true for both rich and dan both of them have been generous not only to political causes but to philanthropic causes
2657390 this pine shaded mansion filled dreamscape of folly and ambition is both the geographic and mythical heart of houston
2657391 long an enclave of houstons wealthiest residents river oaks as opposed to say philadelphias main line or manhattans upper east side tends to be more welcoming less obsessed with pedigree and more open to grand gestures and exhibition
2657392 present that draw for people who otherwise might not visit those homes to see a palatial residence they might not otherwise have an invitation to visit
2657393 you could not have a function like that in west university place with 200 cars
2657394 these are folks who are usually proud of their homes and are willing to open them
2657395 some of these homeowners built their homes because they entertain frequently
2657396 some of the homes have already been vetted meaning the president knows it and the secret service knows it and so it is easy to get approved
2657397 its one of those things where everyone in the neighborhood understands the process
2657398 and its probably the most important presidential election in god how many years
2657399 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
2657400 there will always be differences but overall theyre not that far apart
2657401 we must shift our entire energy economy toward a sustainable mix of new and cleaner power sources
2657402 when gas was 1 50 a gallon it wasnt too costly to be an environmentalist
2657403 when the price goes up to 4 a gallon people start to think about what it is that were giving up
2657404 we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately
2657405 mccain said last week during a campaign stop in pennsylvania
2657406 going along is what got us here to begin with
2657407 going along is what brought the united states from 30 percent imported oil to 60 percent now
2657408 wir sind sehr gut in das spiel gekommen chris war von anfang an sehr aggressiv das hat uns sicherlich geholfen
2657409 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2657410 es war ein anderes gef hl beim gr ten sportereignis der welt dabei zu sein
2657411 wir haben gesagt wenn wir ins viertelfinale wollen m ssen wir dieses spiel gewinnen den pflichtsieg haben wir geschafft
2657412 chris war von beginn an sehr aggressiv und hat uns geholfen ins spiel zu kommen
2657413 ich bin immer da und bereit ich freue mich ber den sieg und dass ich dabei bin
2657414 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2657415 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2657416 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2657417 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2657418 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2657419 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2657420 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2657421 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2657422 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2657423 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2657424 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2657425 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2657426 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2657427 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him
2657428 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2657429 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2657430 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2657431 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2657432 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2657433 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2657434 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2657435 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2657436 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2657437 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2657438 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2657439 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
2657440 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2657441 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2657442 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2657443 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2657444 i think most people today know this is just a story
2657445 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2657446 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2657447 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2657448 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2657449 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2657450 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2657451 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2657452 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2657453 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2657454 i thought it was my other neighbors the blonde neighbors the girl neighbors it wasnt
2657455 can i go with him please i have to ride on the ambulance with him please
2657456 v etci akaj na rozvidnenie aby za ali s akt vnou oper ciou gruz nsko je na pokraji humanit rnej katastrofy

2657459 oh my mom ur old and still u have to worry abt us
2657460 hakka woman is very hardworking woman who works for their life without any complains
2657461 selain harus dapat dijadikan momentum untuk lebih meningkatkan kecintaan terhadap rasulullah saw ada beberapa hikmah yang terkandung dari peringatan isra miraj yang harus dapat dipetik setiap umat islam
2657462 hikmah penting dari peringatan isra miraj ini adalah harus dapat memunculkan kesadaran dan tekad yang bulat dari diri setiap umat islam untuk berubah menjadi lebih baik
2657463 harus didasari oleh ketaatan kepada allah swt tanpa itu umat islam tidak akan bangkit
2657464 hamba allah adalah gelar yang harus diraih setiap mukmin orang yang menjadi hambah allah gerakannya visi dan misinya hidupnya akan jelas hamba allah yang baik hanya ingin dikendalikan oleh sang khaliq bukan oleh yang lainnya
2657465 selain memberinya air susu ibu asi cara untuk membentuk agar akhlak seorang anak dapat seperti akhlak nabi muhammad saw adalah dengan banyak membacakannya shalawat
2657466 sudahkah dilaksanakan sesuai sunah rasul sudah pahamkah akan makna dan gerakan shalat sudah khusukkah shalat selama ini dan berdampakkah shalat yang ditunaikan para perilaku kehidupan keseharian
2657467 my accident is well recorded i had 23 operations i am five inches shorter than i used to be and i was in hospital for six months it was just awful but it wasnt the reason for my divorce
2657468 my marriage ended because john mccain didnt want to be 40 he wanted to be 25 you know that happens it just does
2657469 no knol google com is treated in the code exactly the same if were plain old knol com it has no ranking advantage from google com
2657470 we try to rank all our content on a level playing field
2657471 sometimes you want to be able to challenge somebodys statement
2657472 if its the mayor its going to be the mayors strategic plan
2657473 weve just found through the years much of that can be done in house using local resources through people who know the community intimately
2657474 hardly anyone wants to travel anymore which is understandable when you have a 1 in 3 chance of being stranded
2657475 they cant argue against it so they just hope itll go away
2657476 my dad weldon eakin and my grandfather decided one day i dont know if it was to make money or what to start carving man tracks alongside the dinosaur tracks
2657477 that worried my grandfather because he didnt want anybody ever passing it off as real
2657478 so he and daddy took it out and buried it
2657479 there is such a stress put on parents when they are thinking of financing their children through college
2657480 knowing the government is behind us and understands that education is important that is encouraging
2657481 they know its important enough for them to assist me as the economy changes and that gives me a better feeling
2657482 with tuition rates skyrocketing lower and middle income students and their families are struggling to afford college
2657483 this bill helps hardworking students pursue their dream of a college education
2657484 its a very expensive bill at a time when we are going to have to deal with a crisis in spending
2657485 my sense of the higher education act is that its a mixed bag
2657486 but in total how much of the cost of a students education will a pell grant cover there still will be a substantial gap for many
2657487 i have to jump through all these hoops to get my money back
2657488 i shouldnt have had to do this in the first place
2657489 if you dont want to be stopped for not wearing a helmet get a sticker or take a course
2657490 i didnt know how fast i was going all i cared about was getting away from that truck
2657491 normally when we find an error on a citation the officer cuts a memo to the court that says to dismiss it
2657492 the peace officer time from transporting the citizen to jail and spares the citizen the hassle of being handcuffed and taken in
2657493 i think if were going to ask other private businesses to participate and think about this we need to set a good example
2657494 resistance is not going to be our enemy in this deal complacency will be
2657495 i think that we need to do all that we possibly can afford to do
2657496 i dont want to start running im one of those firm believers that you crawl walk and then run
2657497 its not just me on the court saying we need to be doing this and the rest of them going ho hum
2657498 do we make a commitment or do we just talk about it
2657499 i want us to go with 100 percent and i dont want an option available because a commitment wont be there if we have an option available
2657500 i think the ultimate goal is saving taxpayer dollars while saving their environment
2657501 in the future hopefully what well be looking at is if its not green if its not recyclable if its not energy efficient then were not even looking at it
2657502 we believe our effort will be successful where others have failed repeatedly
2657503 they are proceeding in a very unwise and in a regionally nonsupportive fashion that is for the lack of a better term reckless
2657504 we live in one of the counties that never produced any oil or gas and we are consistently one of the top counties in the state in poverty
2657505 our budget is 8 million and we struggle to serve the people
2657506 we have an enormous surplus of water that has been underutilized for decades
2657507 that is a lot of water and it is being underutilized and the metroplex is looking for water and the chances of this part of oklahoma going dry are virtually nil
2657508 hugo is confident that it will succeed in the suit and that the water sales will proceed
2657509 it complicates ongoing efforts to quickly resolve and establish an agreement for the interstate transfer of water
2657510 it makes for bad policy and it is a real blow to regional coordination and cooperation which historically this region has found a way to do great things it is a real blow to our working relationships
2657511 would it be responsible for me to wait for the district or anyone else to supply water to irving for the next 75 years that is the most critical issue
2657512 if we are able to help the north texas region as a byproduct of the work weve been doing we are quite willing to do it
2657513 manong tigavalenzuela po aku hmmm maaari po bang makisakay 2 petot nalang po ang pera ku
2657514 ano miss tsktsktsk nakikita mo ung van na un miss punta ka dun pasasakayin ka nun
2657515 talaga naman grasya disgrasya ka talga nang nagsabog ang diyos ng katanghan hayun sinalo mo lahat
2657516 johnny is the fantabuloust bartender in all the land i trust no one else with my tasty beverages
2657517 i like the action of it the fact that im constantly moving i dont really sit still well
2657518 theyre the cheetos of the tomato world once you start eating them you cant stop
2657519 all we want is to be treated like human beings not be experimented on like guinea pigs or patronized like bunny rabbits
2657520 you see us as you want to see us in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal does that answer your question
2657521 for some crazy reason i actually thought i could make it better
2657522 i like the themes to emerge from the experience and not be imposed in advance
2657523 scene after scene builds to a powerful cumulative effect not of anger but of immense sadness and futility this is how we live
2657524 i was definitely looking for kids from different social groups who had more archetypal story lines than the archetypes themselves like wanting to achieve something that everyone could relate to
2657525 yeah but it did end up it is sort of remarkable how much it ended like the archetypes for breakfast club that was not my intention not even something i realized until i was editing the film
2657526 other peoples dreams are boring unless we are in them
2657527 the culture the art world its not a fad of the west thats going to fade away china is a power
2657528 i do see in this new generation a new kind of art being made
2657529 maybe not new to the world but certainly new to china the first wave was political pop more direct and obvious work im seeing a much more introspective emotional psychological sexual type of work people investigating themselves and their identity
2657530 has revealed itself to be more psychologically resonant than the facade of pop iconoclasm and gestures of ironic detachment might readily suggest
2657531 surely all of my years as a photographer have led me to this heartbreaking and lyrical place
2657532 the house marina built cherry hill a plantation house and its family
2657533 senator obama as president will you veto any bill that extends the federal moratorium on ocs drilling
2657534 will you veto any bill that calls for or otherwise establishes a withdrawal from iraq that doesnt meet the approval of the uniformed chain of command in that region
2657535 it doesnt matter what he says because nancy pelosi doesnt agree with that so hell never make it happen
2657536 obama has said that he isnt opposed to increased drilling to help alleviate the high cost of oil but such a proposal has not been voted on by your house of representatives in fact that body was adjourned for a month long vacation while people in several areas of the country were still paying close to 4 a gallon for gas why because obama isnt the leader on this issue for his party its nancy pelosi and she doesnt care what barack obama has to say about this issue that is effecting millions of americans every day if she doesnt care about what obama has to say why should you
2657537 obama has said that any withdrawal from iraq needs to be conditions based

2657708 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2657709 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2657710 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2657711 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2657712 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2657713 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2657714 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2657715 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2657730 it is our policy to only gather images on public streets
2657731 the most interesting thing has been the disregard that google has had for private property rights
2657732 a great nation now demands that its leaders abandon the politics of partisan division and find creative solutions to promote the common good a people that prizes candor accountability and fairness insists that a government for the people must level with them and champion the interests of all american families a land of historic resourcefulness has lost its patience with elected officials who have failed to lead
2657733 and so democrats through the most open platform process in history are reaching out today to republicans and independents who hunger for a new direction and a reason to hope
2657734 the republican leadership said they would keep us safe but they overextended our military and failed to respond to new challenges they said they would be compassionate conservatives but they failed to rescue our citizens from the roof tops of new orleans neglected our veterans and denied health insurance to children they promised fiscal responsibility but instead gave tax cuts to the wealthy few and squandered almost a trillion dollars in iraq they promised reform but allowed the oil companies to write our energy agenda and the credit card companies to write the bankruptcy rules
2657735 leadership on these issues has been sorely lacking these past eight years in the 1990s under bill clintons leadership employment and incomes grew and we built up a budget surplus
2657736 from the mother working two jobs to pay the bills and the couple struggling to care for young children and aging parents to the tens of millions of americans without health insurance and the workers who have seen their jobs shipped overseas too many americans have been invisible to our current president and his party for too long the people who do the work in america have never been invisible to the democratic party
2657737 health care should be a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford employers should have incentives to provide coverage to their workers insurers and providers should ensure high quality affordable care and the government should ensure that health insurance is affordable and provides meaningful coverage as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance and take steps to lead healthy lives
2657738 health care reform must also ensure adequate incentives for innovation to ensure that americans have access to evidence based and cost effective health care research should be based on science not ideology we need to invest in biomedical research and stem cell research so that we are at the leading edge of prevention and treatment
2657739 we oppose the current administrations consistent attempts to undermine a womans ability to make her own life choices and obtain reproductive health care including birth control we will end health insurance discrimination against contraception and provide compassionate care to rape victims we will never put ideology above womens health
2657740 we reject the notion of the presumptive republican nominee that social security is a disgrace we believe that it is indispensable
2657741 we will strengthen the ability of workers to organize unions and fight to pass the employee free choice act we will restore pro worker voices to the national labor relations board and the national mediation board and we support overturning the nlrbs and nmbs many harmful decisions that undermine the collective bargaining rights of millions of workers
2657742 we will expand the family and medical leave act to reach millions more workers than are currently covered and will enable workers to take leave to care for an elderly parent address domestic violence and sexual assault or attend a parent teacher conference
2657743 we the democratic party are the party that has produced more women governors senators and members of congress than any other we have produced first woman secretary of state the first woman speaker of the house of representatives and in 2008 hillary rodham clinton the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation we believe that our daughters should have the same opportunities as our sons our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2657744 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2657745 we must ensure that every student has a high quality teacher and an effective principal that starts with recruiting a new generation of teachers and principals by making this pledge if you commit your life to teaching america will commit to paying for your college education well provide better preparation mentoring and career ladders where there are teachers who are still struggling and underperforming we should provide them with individual help and support and if theyre still underperforming after that we should find a quick and fair way consistent with due process to put another teacher in that classroom
2657746 at community colleges and training programs across the country we will invest in short term accelerated training and technical certifications for the unemployed and under employed to speed their transition into careers in high demand occupations and emerging industries we will reward successful community colleges with grants so they can continue their good work we support education delivery that makes it possible for nontraditional students to receive support and encouragement to obtain a college education including internet distance education and night and weekend programs we need to fully fund joint labor management apprenticeship programs and reinvigorate our industrial crafts programs to train the next generation of skilled american craft workers
2657747 our institutions of higher education are also the economic engines of today and tomorrow we will partner with them to translate new ideas into innovative products processes and services
2657748 today we are again called to provide visionary leadership this centurys threats are at least as dangerous as and in some ways more complex than those we have confronted in the past they come from weapons that can kill on a mass scale and from violent extremists who respond to alienation or perceived injustice with terror they come from rogue states allied to terrorists and from rising powers that could challenge both america and the international foundation of liberal democracy they come from weak states that cannot control their territory or provide for their people they come from an addiction to oil that helps fund the extremism we must fight and empowers repressive regimes and they come from a warming planet that will spur new diseases spawn more devastating natural disasters and catalyze deadly conflicts
2657749 the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was we will defeat al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan where those who actually attacked us on 9 11 reside and are resurgent
2657750 we believe taxpayer dollars should be spent to invest in our fighting men and women not to fatten the pockets of private companies
2657751 we believe that in the 21st century the u s must treat canada latin america and the caribbean as full partners just as our neighbors to the south should reject the bombast of authoritarian bullies
2657752 and we must build ties to the people of cuba and help advance their liberty by allowing unlimited family visits and remittances to the island while presenting the cuban regime with a clear choice if it takes significant steps toward democracy beginning with the unconditional release of all political prisoners we will be prepared to take steps to begin normalizing relations
2657753 we will encourage china to play a responsible role as a growing power to help lead in addressing the common problems of the twenty first century
2657754 our starting point must always be our special relationship with israel grounded in shared interests and shared values and a clear strong fundamental commitment to the security of israel our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy that commitment which requires us to ensure that israel retains a qualitative edge for its national security and its right to self defense is all the more important as we contend with growing threats in the region a strengthened iran a chaotic iraq the resurgence of al qaeda the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah we support the implementation of the memorandum of understanding that pledges 30 billion in assistance to israel over the next decade to enhance and ensure its security
2657755 the creation of a palestinian state through final status negotiations together with an international compensation mechanism should resolve the issue of palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there rather than in israel all understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel the parties have agreed that jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations it should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths
2657756 we also support the adoption of humanitarian licensing policies that ensure medications developed with the u s taxpayer dollars are available off patent in developing countries we will repeal the global gag rule and reinstate funding to the united nations population fund unfpa we will expand access to health care and nutrition for women and reduce the burden of maternal mortality
2657757 american leadership on human rights is essential to making the world safer more just and more humane such leadership must begin with steps to undo the damage of the bush years but we also must go much further we should work with others to shape human rights institutions and instruments tailored to the twenty first century we must make the united nations human rights organs more objective energetic and effective the u s must lead global efforts to promote international humanitarian standards and to protect civilians from indiscriminate violence during warfare we will champion accountability for genocide and war crimes ending the scourge of impunity for massive human rights abuses
2657758 for the millions living here illegally but otherwise playing by the rules we must require them to come out of the shadows and get right with the law we support a system that requires undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine pay taxes learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens they are our neighbors and we can help them become full tax paying law abiding productive members of society
2657759 and we need to crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants especially those who pay their workers less than the minimum wage its a problem when we only enforce our laws against the immigrants themselves with raids that are ineffective tear apart families and leave people detained without adequate access to counsel
2657760 we honor the central place of faith in our lives like our founders we believe that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires we believe that change comes not from the top down but from the bottom up and that few are closer to the people than our churches synagogues temples and mosques to face todays challenges from saving our planet to ending poverty we need all hands on deck faith based groups are not a replacement for government or secular non profit programs rather they are yet another sector working to meet challenges of the 21st century we will empower grassroots faith based and community groups to help meet challenges like poverty ex offender reentry and illiteracy at the same time we can ensure that these partnerships do not endanger first amendment protections and that public funds are not used to proselytize or discriminate we will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are only used on programs that actually work
2657761 too many fathers are missing missing from too many lives and too many homes children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and are more likely to commit crime drop out of school abuse drugs and end up in prison we need more fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception we need them to understand that what makes a man is not the ability to have a the courage to raise one we will support fathers by providing transitional training to get jobs removing tax penalties on married families and expanding maternity and paternity leave we will reward those who are responsibly supporting their children by giving them a tax credit crack down on men who avoid child support payments and we will ensure that payments go directly to families instead of bureaucracies
2657762 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
2657763 on criminal justice its a bit disappointing while it stresses prevention and drug treatment including more drug courts theres a lot of emphasis on more cops and nothing criticizing mandatory minimum sentences
2657764 as we combat terrorism we must not sacrifice the american values we are fighting to protect in recent years weve seen an administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand the democratic party rejects this dichotomy we will restore our constitutional traditions and recover our nations founding commitment to liberty under law
2657765 we support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving americans
2657766 to build a freer and safer world we will lead in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the american people we will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law we will respect the time honored principle of habeas corpus the seven century old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our supreme court we will close the detention camp in guantanamo bay the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years with these necessary changes the attention of the world will be directed where it belongs on what terrorists have done to us not on how we treat suspects
2657767 we will vigorously enforce our voting rights laws instead of making them tools of partisan political agendas we oppose laws that require identification in order to vote or register to vote which create discriminatory barriers to the right to vote and disenfranchise many eligible voters we oppose tactics which purge eligible voters from voter rolls

2657837 in assembling evidence from some of the most difficult witnesses in the trials during world war ii
2657838 i found that german soldiers and civilians as well as russian and polish slave laborers gave infinitely more information when asked to write their recollections leisurely than they furnished under interrogation in several instances i was unable to get more than scant information by resorting to lengthy and tedious interrogation whereas the suggestion that the individual involved provide a written statement usually brought forth an astounding abundance of information this was true even in cases where the individual involved had occupied a prominent position in the nazi hierarchy and was possessed of a high degree of intelligence
2657839 one may speculate as to the reason for such a reaction it may be due to the feeling that the testimony is accurately recorded by being written by the witnesses and hence the witness feels safer in disclosing it there may be other psychological factors involved i particularly favored this method of obtaining a statement because in instances where it was in effect a confession the statement was less vulnerable to the attack of involuntariness
2657840 what i am leading up to is the advisability of oswalds wife being asked to furnish such a recording of her recollections in her own handwriting
2657841 i am sure you realize that the predicate would have to be carefully laid both the person approaching her as well as the interpreter should be carefully chosen so that she would not become suspicious of the request she should be made to understand that only the truth is sought and her interest in the development of the truth should be stimulated inasmuch as it appears that she would like to continue to live in this country i have the feeling that if she were properly approached she would be quite cooperative
2657842 she should be requested to comment in detail on certain phases of this matter for instance 1 the names or such identifying factors as she can furnish of all persons with whom oswald had any dealings during the time of their marriage 2 did he at any time mention any contacts with representatives of the russian government and if so where when etc 3 his complete comments at the time of the general walker incident 4 why she believes oswald was the assassin
2657843 such an undertaking may not develop more than has been obtained from her but i would be greatly surprised if it did not
2657844 i question that this should be done by the fbi in that this agency probably has an image in her thinking that is not conducive to obtaining the best results
2657845 i know of no finer document you could have in your possession than a statement written in her own handwriting in the russian language
2657846 when asked you arrived at the conclusion your husband had killed the president
2657847 she stated that when she saw him at the police station i could see by his eyes that he was guilty rather he tried to appear brave
2657848 however by his eyes i could tell that he was afraid
2657849 i was telling marty the other day how bad it is that some of his children even have heard it and believe it
2657850 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2657851 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2657852 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2657853 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2657854 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2657855 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2657856 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
2657857 dude man i just saw the lifehouse skit on youtube
2657858 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2657859 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2657870 since i first took up the axe in your service master ive never seen timber so marvelous so full of potential but you didnt even bother to look at it you just walked right past without even pausing why
2657871 not another word about that tree its worthless wood if you made a boat from it the boat would sink if you made a coffin from it the coffin would rot in not time if you made tools from it the tools would break in no time if you made doors and gates from it theyd sweat sticky sap if you made pillars from it theyd soon be full of termites that tree has no potential whatsoever its useless you cant make anything with it how do you think its lived so long
2657872 ive been perfecting uselessness for a long time now close to death ive finally mastered it and its of great use to me if theyd ever found a use for me would i be this grand look the two of us were just things so how is it things go around denouncing things and you a worthless man so close to death what do you know about worthless wood
2657873 if its so determined to be useless why is it the village shrine
2657874 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

2657882 i am very happy about our performance today against a very technical talented japan team
2657883 besides a great goal by carli lloyd i am very happy about our tactics
2657884 the reason for a rod rodriguez instead of kai was her speed
2657885 that was crucial when we looked at the way japan plays she had a specific role to get behind the japanese defense and she played very well so i thought it was a good move

2657905 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
2657906 a growing effort by the american military to control graphic images from the war
2657907 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2657908 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2657909 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2657910 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2657911 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2657912 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2657913 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2657914 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2657915 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2657916 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2657917 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2657918 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2657919 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2657920 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2657921 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2657922 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2657923 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2657924 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2657925 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2657926 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2657927 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2657928 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2657929 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2657930 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2657931 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2657932 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2657933 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2657934 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2657935 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2657936 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2657937 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2657938 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2657939 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2657940 hanging out at the surface would be a daft strategy for avoiding predators because that is where they can spot your silhouette
2657941 we never planned how many children to have we just let god guide our lives you know because we strongly believe life comes from god and thats the reason we did not stop the life
2657942 we thank god all of them are healthy and happy
2657943 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain ive got my fingers crossed hopefully tomorrow will be better
2657944 the readings that we were looking at indicated that we have no cause for concern at this stage
2657945 it feels like youre at 3 000 meters because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog right now im just knackered
2657946 we seem to be stuck in a weather pattern that is bringing us high humidity and higher than normal temperatures but despite all this the air quality continues to remain in the satisfactory range that does not pose any threat to the athletes
2657947 hurry up with that thing dammit im gonna lose it
2657948 gf la everytime also argue dont know why we argue so often also
2657949 ok thats cool but xxx had better not be there
2657950 well thanks and fuck you too would you like me to bend over and push someones head up my ass while were discussing this

2657955 i cant express how excited i am to be able to start off with that event and how it turned out

2657959 im assuming this kid had his shots and a doctors blessing to be out among the masses
2657960 i have a newsflash for him parenthood does change you and you cannot live the exact same life you did before especially if you were a jetsetting camera friendly celebrity like mcconohottie once you have a child
2657961 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2657962 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2657963 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2657964 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2657965 scenes of crime officers pathologists and other specialists are working to establish the circumstances and the identities of the deceased
2657966 jenna jameson delivers some of her finest boy girl sex scenes to date in this torrid tale of love amp lust
2657967 brad armstrong once again proves himself to be one of porns most entertaining directors and the lovely jenna jameson proves herself to be the best thing to happen to porn since maybe the creation of porn itself

2657978 tackling missing trader fraud is hmrcs top priority we have a duty to protect the revenue given the scale and nature of the attack we are seeing
2657979 in my experience when faced with vat prosecution people turn to their usual solicitor who probably will not have any experience in vat cases that solicitor is then on a steep learning curve hm revenue amp customs will have done their homework and will have an experienced accounting and legal team on board winning is a tough challenge loosing is a life changing experience and may result in imprisonment

2657989 with its population of 1 3 billion people and its changing economy china can one day be a cricket power to rival india
2657990 it may not be in five years but it will certainly be within a decade china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
2657991 i dont think the success of cricket in china depends on having hundreds of thousands of people playing it in the park on a saturday afternoon i think it depends on promoting it as a television product
2657992 look at india and the commercialisation of cricket there there is no reason why that cant happen in china its a growing economy its a changing economy but its also an economy that is becoming an avid consumer of western culture

2658014 my friend john eubanks was a great american he always said give everything a sporting chance when you go coon huntin either take a cross cut saw with you so that you can cut down the tree the coon is in or climb up the tree and punch him out and make him jump in among the dogs give him a sporting chance many times my brother sonny and i would make a coon jump in amongst twenty or thirty dogs but at least that coon had the option of whuppin all them dogs and walkin off if he wanted to

2658019 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2658020 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2658021 my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
2658022 destroying islam and pashtuns at the behest of his american masters
2658023 due to the current situation in the state and especially the road blockade many marriages have been cancelled in marriages here we have to prepare several varieties of meat and chicken
2658024 we are suffering a lot we have taken advance from the people people do lot of preparations for marriages
2658025 we are looking at some options at the moment three or four different options about the strike department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2658026 the findings are important because of the role drink plays in for example unsafe sex
2658027 if at the end of three years local government has not delivered on those building blocks i think there will be some really big questions to be asked about its capacity to commission these services in the future
2658028 councils are best placed to make decisions on providing care and support to local people thanks to their knowledge of whats available in each area and how best it can be managed
2658029 coming out of high school people were telling me i wasnt this i wasnt going to do this in football just from the standpoint of me being this big
2658030 but the way i look at it im just like mike goodson when i get on the football field its really nothing big to me i just let the critics do what they do and the people who watch fantasy football let them do what they do
2658031 i think if you ask 32 nfl teams where would you play this guy that they would play him at fullback
2658032 he doesnt have the speed the other guys have we need more explosive plays from our tailback position
2658033 fullback you have to block a lot more instead of standing in the backfield waiting for an opponent now i have to go find a defender and lay it on him so its a big difference
2658034 the weight loss factor is something i dont want that to hold him back from being the player hes capable of being
2658035 i think he can be a very good football player for us at the position we have him at as a runner blocker and receiver
2658036 i just dont want the weight issues to cause fatigue to cause injury to keep him out of the practices that kind of snowballs itself if you are not careful
2658037 people look at like i can just wake up one day and lose weight
2658038 once you do it you feel good your energy level comes back but other than that people just think losing weight is something you can do overnight its a hard process
2658039 its two a days so everybody is going to be tired
2658040 the guys who weigh 160 are going to be tired so what it really comes down to is where your heart is everybody is going to be tired
2658041 just because im big thats been my mentality all my life ive been dunking a basketball since i was in seventh grade
2658042 thats been part of my life me being big and people stereotyping me but one day coach may see it and i may have to take the team on my shoulders for a game and it is what it is

2658044 attitudes towards spanking and bondage are changing it seems that people particularly those living in cities and urban areas are becoming far more open to alternative sexual behaviour
2658045 phone sex is actually a pretty safe activity you cant get pregnant and you cant get an sti a lot of loving couples use phone sex when they are apart but naturally they get close up and personal again as soon as they are together again
2658046 due to lack of credibility of the threat the building lapd and mgm are not recommending that we take any actions
2658047 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2658048 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2658049 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms

2658064 he had such a deep reservoir of talent mac had a way of making everyone in the audience feel like they were family he is irreplaceable
2658065 a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place
2658066 he came from the day when you were required to do more than tell a joke
2658067 he could do the dramatic as well as the funny there are those gifted entertainers like bernie and richard pryor who understood black culture from both sides the happy and the sad he didnt have to be the clown
2658068 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2658069 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2658070 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2658071 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2658072 do we know these girls are underage no we dont but i think thats beside the point if theyre not underage the publisher is trying to make us think they are the better to appeal to our prurient fascination with adolescent sexuality and the corruption of innocence
2658073 ive been doing it to work out the contradictions in my argument but i thought maybe it might be useful perhaps some others not the staunch rads who obviously dont dirty themselves by coming on to my foul little blog whose opinions on pornography are based on their own life experiences

2658075 in my opinion the state failed to prove that the accused person refused or failed to expose or offer for sale the goods in question

2658077 i want to be someone an injured marine can talk to
2658078 and i can tell them times will be rough and not always easy as an amputee but you can still make great things out of an unfortunate situation thats what i want to do
2658079 he didnt just choose to come he fought to come
2658080 we bled and sweated with this guy in iraq and he wants to be with us more than anything thats awesome
2658081 we thought it wasnt safe for them to go out but they went in anyways
2658082 by the time we came back from our walk the cops were coming down here
2658083 one of the children tried to go back in the water and help him to the rocks
2658084 he went under water and that was the last he was seen
2658085 equipment was being ripped from their vests it just got to the point were it was so treacherous that it was putting our divers at risk

2658096 our trust in them and their trust in us allows us to go a little deeper and even mine the personal events in their lives
2658097 we talk about the cringe worthy things that weve done and then laugh about them afterwards thats what happens to our audiences theyre so mortified but then they see themselves in it and they can only laugh theres something liberating about it
2658098 its really really difficult to make a movie that has any sort of truth in it any real human interaction and behavior in it with the studio model of a big crew and budget jay and i came out of film school in our 20s trying to make movies in that kind of environment where you spend 90 percent of your time and energy managing the technical aspects of the film and then you realize oh i forgot we have to get good acting and story in here and you come up with what we like to call the hamburger without the meat
2658099 we flip flopped that equation of 90 percent of your time devoted to technical and 10 percent to story and acting
2658100 we dont have a lot of money and resources to make that glossy beautiful film but the things that are free are good story and good acting so we can actually put our energies there so it doesnt cost anything and get something that is genuine
2658101 we could talk about it for hours but the basic idea is two heads are better than one
2658102 it must have been really fun and less stressful for all the fleetwood mac ers to go off and make their solo albums but none of them was as successful as when they were together
2658103 the one who woke up in a good mood that morning usually leads the charge
2658104 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
2658105 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
2658106 im ready to fight everybody everybody who deserves a shot
2658107 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him hes very very tough
2658108 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2658109 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2658110 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2658111 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2658112 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2658113 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2658114 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa

2658117 con le tue preghiere al santo martire lorenzo avevi ottenuto di metterti in viaggio
2658118 non trascuriamo san lorenzo che vedendo il suo vescovo sisto condotto al martirio cominci a piangere non perch quello era condotto a morire ma perch egli doveva sopravvivergli
2658119 dove vai padre senza tuo figlio dove ti affretti o santo vescovo senza il tuo diacono
2658120 non ti lascio non ti abbandono o figlio ma ti sono riservate prove pi difficili

2658125 mentre seguiva il martire sisto un responso profetico ne ottenne
2658126 non atterr il supplizio il designato erede di quel sangue che con occhio pietoso anzi contempla la sorte che sar sua
2658127 gi in quel martirio il martire trionfa successore legittimo tiene un impegno siglato dalla voce e dal sangue

2658131 quali tesori pi preziosi ha cristo di quelli nei quali ha detto di trovarsi
2658132 sono veramente tesori quelli in cui c cristo in cui c la fede di cristo
2658133 ma la derisa avidit si rode e la vendetta con le fiamme appresta

2658138 this seems a bit outside of apples normal sphere of business for now
2658139 ketika ini saya tidak nampak sesiapa calon tentunya dari bn anwar akan menang tapi apa yang menarik ialah margin
2658140 sama ada undi lebih besar dan lebih kecil dari apa yang beliau anwar dapat pada masa lelpas
2658141 jika majoriti undi yang diperolehi anwar kurang umno boleh terus ke depan untuk kembali mendapat sokongan rakyat
2658142 tak mungkin saya telah berundur pada 2003 dan saya telah kata saya tidak akan datang semula tetapi saya punya hak sebagai warga untuk membuat ulasan mengenai negara saya
2658143 terpulang siapa calon bebas yang bertanding kalau dia daripada serpihan pas kemungkinan ia akan mengurangkan undi kepada anwar kalau dia bekas umno maka dia akan menambah kelebihan undi kepada anwar tetapi tidak ada kemungkinan calon bebas ini akan menang
2658144 the very strong message that comes out of it is dont take anything or anyone for granted
2658145 you have to work very very hard to get elected and re elected in politics and its a very very big challenge
2658146 i think the circumstances in the nt were obviously clearly different
2658147 there were different factors going on up there but i think the very strong message that comes out of it is dont take anything for granted
2658148 i made the point already that very small numbers of people changing their vote can change the election outcomes in wa
2658149 you have to win the vote and give them reason to vote for you and thats what i intend to do
2658150 we were effectively looking at a six to eight month election campaign stretched out in front of everybody where everything i was saying and doing and everything the ministers were saying and doing was being discounted as being said because an election was looming
2658151 nato j lgib teraselt kuid kinnitab et ta pole konfliktiga seotud

2658153 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
2658154 a like can be halfway around the world by the time the truth gets its pants on
2658155 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2658156 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2658157 ten amos un orden en la cancha establecido y sobre todo ten amos un despliegue ofensivo fuerte era un equipo muy dif cil el atlas no era f cil pero poco a poco con trabajo fue un partido de trabajo y lo cumplieron los muchachos
2658158 se trata de ir en ascenso desde luego de eso se trata y sobre todo ahora se est realizando sab amos que nos iban a dejar pocas opciones de gol y hab a que aprovecharlas y se aprovecharon bien
2658159 s desde luego yo creo que el trabajo lo hicieron muy bien el primer tiempo hicieron un trabajo de desgaste importante y luego entr lucas a hacer lo suyo y entr bien
2658160 yo creo que eso fue lo que m s nos gust yo creo que eso fue lo que m s nos agrad o sea trabajamos el partido era un partido de trabajo y se resolvi trabajamos el primer tiempo y lo resolvimos el segundo yo creo que as fue
2658161 falta mucho falta mucho tiempo pero yo pienso que los j venes se tienen que desarrollar un poco m s un poco mejor pero s estamos en v as de eso de consistencia fue un partido dif cil y lo sacamos adelante
2658162 esos adjetivos p nganselos ustedes prensa por m estoy de acuerdo
2658163 ah vamos simplemente ah vamos no hay que cantar victoria ni mucho menos todav a no llegamos vamos escal n por escal n y hasta ahora los escalones han sido firmes s lidos y los hemos pasado as pero nos falta mucho todav a
2658164 we proved to the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2658165 its probably not good that we read this stuff on the net because we know people doubt us but we have something to prove
2658166 i got angry and thought about those moments when i let the horse go and i decided that im not falling off no matter what
2658167 i tightened up and swung like a cat really careful on every hand placement and got in a good rhythm
2658168 were on track looking around at everyone we all said we could have done things better we didnt peak out today we are where we want to be
2658169 s muy valioso al final tuvimos para sacar los tres puntos pero no nos alcanz un empate bueno con un equipo que juega muy bien al futbol y bueno vamos bien hay que corregir peque os errores que estamos haciendo estoy contento pero vamos a seguir trabajando para estar a punto hay que mantenernos tranquilos esto apenas comienza
2658170 es muy importante estar invictos dos empates de visita y uno ganado en casa pero seguro vamos a mejorar mucho en el vestidor comentamos del penal que para nosotros no era tambi n que ten amos que seguir proponiendo el partido y con esa mentalidad seguro pod amos sacar puntos
2658171 muy bien la verdad estoy contento por haber sido tomado en cuenta con la selecci n pasaron cinco a os para tener una nueva oportunidad y pues se medio claro que voy a tratar de aprovecharla
2658172 el idioma no es problema porque hay muchos que podemos hablar ingles aparte el estratega sven sabe ya muy bien hablar espa ol
2658173 ganar o perder es de esta profesi n la forma s me preocupa
2658174 me parece justa la victoria de tigres creo que el primer tiempo fue muy parejo los dos equipos estuvieron encima el primer tiempo no dej nada de ninguno de los dos tigres en el segundo tiempo fue muy superior a nosotros y tuvo m s actitud que nosotros que eso es lo que m s me preocupa porque si hubo algo que ha tenido este equipo que ha sido siempre reconocido por la entrega y la actitud por eso hoy nos defraudamos y defraudamos hay que hablarlo analizarlo
2658175 todo el partido tenemos que charlar bastante nos llega el camino que la nica verdad es esto analizar todo lo que puede estar sucediendo pero para m fundamentalmente m s all de lo accidentado y lo que pas en el partido pasado me preocupo m s porque reitero defraudamos a lo que es al menos en estos ocho meses el sello atlas que era la actitud en el segundo tiempo carecimos totalmente de eso y perdimos las riendas
2658176 lo vamos a analizar y hablar m s tranquilos reconocer al ganador en este caso a tigres y analizar nosotros y revertir de cara a lo que viene
2658177 no no es mi punto de vista porque hemos tenido ausencias importantes en el torneo pasado en copa libertadores en interliga y entraba otro compa ero y jugando bien el equipo ganando la actitud fue diferente eso es lo que m s me preocupa hoy m s que la derrota
2658178 tampoco podemos quedarnos en inferioridad num rica que eso tambi n me preocupa m s all de la lesi n de mendivil perdimos otro delantero tambi n por expulsi n que es lo de romero entonces hay varias cosas que me preocupan de cara a lo que viene volver a empezar analizar y volver a caminar
2658179 simplemente es un partido que sufrimos por actitud despu s esto reci n est comenzando la preocupaci n que analizaremos todos juntos veremos de nuevo el partido las cosas que hemos fallado y a seguir para adelante volver para el camino
2658180 los partidos son de 90 minutos y hay que jugarlos y monterrey fue un equipo que nunca baj los brazos y ah logr el empate
2658181 siempre analizamos los partidos ahora mucho m s vamos a tratar de mantener la calma creer y confiar en el grupo y nunca bajar los brazos
2658182 no estoy conforme siempre busco ganar y bueno no me voy a gusto siempre hace falta una victoria a nosotros nos dar a m s confianza y la vamos a buscar
2658183 fue buena la actuaci n nos falta corregir esos 30 minutos finales donde ten amos la victoria y no le dimos la seguridad al equipo y sobre todo ser contundentes por supuesto que s falta mejorar estamos en una etapa de menos a m s y creo que hoy fue buen partido nos deja amargura el empate pero s es cierto que debemos mejorar el nivel
2658184 fue un estira y afloja ellos tambi n son un equipo que t cticamente cambia constantemente y nosotros tambi n lo hicimos y bueno fue un empate que hay que analizarlo y mejorar l gicamente
2658185 es algo normal en el futbol fue un partido intenso y eso fue el reflejo de lo que pas en la cancha
2658186 al final tuvimos una muy clara que no pudimos convertir pero lo que no s es lo de la jugada del penalti no s qu cobr si se adelant o no el arquero pero por esas cosas uno se va con mucha bronca y pesa la local a por eso nos vamos con mucha bronca
2658187 no nos desconcentr creo que en todo momento fuimos a buscar el partido y por suerte vino el empate y creo que era lo m s justo llevarnos un punto de ac lo que veo es que no s por qu hizo que se pateara el penalti otra vez y cuando juegan de local equipos como chivas en ocasiones les cobran a favor y eso te deja un poco de bronca
2658188 in any case the time is too short for monika to compete in olympics
2658189 she has tested positive and there is no reason why she should compete in beijing we have no information that she is coming here
2658190 i was just looking to go and race those guys and show we belong
2658191 the main thing was to get to the final this will be a little bit of a theme really that these finals are so tough to make you really have to compete in the heats to come back around and do it again in the final is definitely a challenge you look at the final today and phelps is an all star he really is he was the only one who was able to step us his game in the final
2658192 but with these morning finals were learning to deal with that and i think the fact that we all went faster is a really good sign we did a canadian record and that was the best we could do today we were in the race the whole time we showed we can race with the rest of the world
2658193 it says that weve come a long way from athens athens was kind of a wakeup call and we knew that we could do better than than thats been our goal for the last four years and thats what we prepared for
2658194 i think were going to have a lot of finals here
2658195 the finals in the morning are a challenge it took 4 11 to make the final and only three people did that in the final each one is a race and its just all about competing thats just the way it is
2658196 we wanted to be in the race if you come here then lets be in the race i think what you see now is a team that feels like they belong in the finals at the olympics
2658197 we dont want anything less than finals when guys like keith beavers and ryan cochrane are ninth and not happy with it thats good
2658198 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2658199 die anzeigepflicht w re ein wichtiger teil gewesen aber nicht der einzige es sind weitere wesentliche bestimmungen dabei von denen ich m chte dass sie sobald wie m glich in kraft treten
2658200 schau dich um vielleicht f llt dir einer ein der dir ein bisschen hnlich sieht
2658201 wei t du was am besten den spielst du auch
2658202 each moves without markings because each is fully aware of the other
2658203 away with you man woman insert a name here you had your chance and you rejected it every sunday you heard the invitation and you did not heed it your friends your family sang encouraging you to change but you didnt through out the week my spirit moved others to share the word with you and you refused it men preached women admonished the bible was right there in front of you to confirm what they spoke and you did nothing because of your foolish pride you shall suffer a million fold worse than any pains you could experience or even conceive of during your sojourn on earth depart from me wicked doer depart depart
2658204 one need not overly focus on the idiosyncracies of making a perfect final sports betting art piece but instead on making foundation work solid and easy to discern
2658205 as far as tax collection goes from the public some of our officers are taking the initiative to say see ya later
2658206 the union is not going to go to the bargaining table and sit there and spin its wheels
2658207 thats where we were a few months ago hopefully when we go back in the fall something will happen
2658208 we would like to emphasize that the cbsa will respond quickly to any situation to maintain the security of our border and ensure it remains open to legitimate travellers and goods
2658209 we thought with this that a lot of people would want to drop out of the lawsuit
2658210 what weve found is more people want to get on board members who have talked to us have said it is not enough and we need to proceed
2658211 were waiting for new information as well were very close to having our case put together
2658212 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2658213 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2658214 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2658215 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2658216 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2658217 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2658218 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2658219 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2658220 jeg kan frygte at vi ikke har oplev et den sidste drukneulykke i r n r vi lige er begyndt p august som er den sommerm ned med mest vind og str m
2658221 havneulykkerne ser vi som et s rligt problem der er behov for et st rre oplysningsarbejde og vi vil gerne arbejde sammen med havnene om det
2658222 der er is r tre r d som alle badende b r f lge man m aldrig g l ngere ud end til navlen man m aldrig bade alene og det g lder uanset om man er fem eller 75 r gammel og n r der er b rn med er det en god id hvis de voksne f rst m rker efter om der er str m i vandet
2658223 when a sales person at pure beauty introduced me to this product in 2003 i was initially turned off by the price ten bucks for a bottle of clear polish seemed ridiculous she insisted that i wouldnt regret it and oh so helpfully reminded me of their full refund policy so i happily handed her some cash and skipped off into the sunset
2658224 whats the difference between a polish change and a manicure it depends on the salon but usually during a polish change the nail technician wont file your nails down wont cut your cuticles youre never supposed to cut your cuticles at the salon anyway and they may skip the soaking part
2658225 all of the colors with the exception of mini shorts have that thick high shine classic finish essie is known for mini shorts doesnt seem to be quite as shiny as the other shades are and im not sure why that is but a high shine top coat like seche vite should bring the shine up to par
2658226 a lippmann manicure is less painful than a typical mani pedi treatment cuticles arent cut hands and toes are soaked in large bowls of warm water rather than spa tubs with jets and the nails are only filed in one direction to prevent breakage its more of a holistic approach to nail care
2658227 lippmann collection polishes have a reputation in the beauty world theyre known for their durability and thats not hype either early last month i got a mani pedi at the lippmann nail bar in hawaii and the coral color on my toes is still fresh and intact ive been reapplying top coat every five days but even that with most other brands of polish would not have been enough to make the color last as long as it has so far
2658228 i was pretty stoked to give the colors a try when i spotted the kit because ive been going through a bright nail polish phase i couldnt wait to try these colors on
2658229 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2658230 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2658231 los pueblos ind genas son de los primeros en padecer los efectos adversos de unas condiciones meteorol gicas cada vez mas dif ciles y variables y la falta generalizada de autonom a para reivindicar bienes y servicios a los que otros grupos de poblaci n tienen mayor acceso
2658232 hay una contradicci n entre promover la inversi n y reconocer los derechos ind genas
2658233 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2658234 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2658235 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2658236 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2658237 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2658238 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2658239 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2658240 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2658241 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2658242 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2658243 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2658244 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2658245 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2658246 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2658247 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2658248 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2658249 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen any time
2658250 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down
2658251 they said over and over again theyre going to do what they have to do to help this team win
2658252 ive been there before i know what its all about i think it brings out the best in all of us and i think it makes our team better so im no stranger to that i welcome the challenge and i look forward to it
2658253 it would help kunz if he were not the safety net quite yet
2658254 felipe alou used to talk about that bring em in but dont let the other team see them too long
2658255 but there is a different feeling in that ninth inning i guess its the nature of the beast but tonight and last night i was a lot more relaxed
2658256 he got the broadway sign hes on the paper every day it must be nice for him
2658257 now theyve got the expectations and therell probably be less media in our locker room thats better for us
2658258 in new york the giants have always been the team
2658259 i dont think thats going to change but its nice for the jets to get some good publicity it seems like things are positive now for them which is good
2658260 i didnt see no reason for him to retire besides playing the game 17 plus years he hadnt lost a step his arm his throws everything was the same
2658261 great quarterback i just dont know if that was a smooth idea im not saying hes going to do something bad because i dont really know what the jets got this year but i think he had a pretty good thing with the packers
2658262 you wanted them to step up to the plate and they did
2658263 you wanted them to make the big splash and they did
2658264 he makes the announcement but when the emotion goes away no one realizes that he didnt go to court
2658265 i feel better from the right side than from the left side
2658266 but today in that particular at bat in the seventh inning i was feeling my legs as a hitter thats what you want you want to feel your legs and see the ball and hit the ball there are times you get caught up in thinking too much
2658267 jerrys gonna put guys where it is best for the team i have no problem with that it really doesnt make any difference
2658268 after a bad game i dont hit the streets too much
2658269 you can play great for six games in a row and have a bad game and theyll make it seem like its the end of the world
2658270 it was one of the all time worst practices ive ever seen
2658271 why are you picking on a man when hes down its only a simple slump now leave the guy alone you bum
2658272 id just like to beat the guy for a change
2658273 the knock on him was that his arm wasnt that strong so what i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game i play in it doesnt matter hes very effective
2658274 hes a good player and were going to face a lot of good players and hes definitely got some insight into the things we do
2658275 theres going to be a lot of excitement and a lot of comparisons
2658276 i was told a lot that the nfl is easier than college
2658277 so once we take that next step its not as hard
2658278 guys are big and fast but im big and fast too
2658279 he agrees we certainly dont want to break camp without him having gotten anything done here
2658280 because the time in new york before the sept 4 opener is short
2658281 there were times in practice when i was wondering if i made the right move
2658282 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im 38 years old so im a little behind there too
2658283 my arm feels fine its going to be sore ive been throwing but theres no substitute for game type situations
2658284 favre is trying to learn everybodys name he is trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms everybody will help him along with the process
2658285 being in the same system and the same place for so long you get used to a routine
2658286 i think were going to be fine because he already opened up the lines of communication
2658287 it was a great feeling to come out for practice today
2658288 at this point in training camp everyone is like man its hot out here but practice went by so fast today just because of the fans
2658289 there were times in practice i was wondering if i made the right move
2658290 to be totally honest with you i didnt know the jets were 4 12 last year until i got up here
2658291 i got more clothes than him bless his heart when his dad died he had to go get a suit
2658292 im telling you the shine was in his eye and the pep was in his step
2658293 i didnt fit in with the other coaches our offensive coordinator i miss my mustache but i didnt have the look the look is important we sat as an athletic staff with our chancellor the other day and he kept saying over and over about perception i want to have that positive perception i dont want to be someone who doesnt look like the quality were striving for in this program but the honest answer is i want to stay one step ahead of the posse
2658294 when you havent played for a year a game like this means a lot
2658295 i love the pga championship and i hate to not be continuing but i have got to get ready for the ryder cup
2658296 the singles were ground balls which isnt a big deal
2658297 i gave up a couple doubles but i felt like i made some good pitches i competed which is all that really matters
2658298 im just going to move on ive already done that
2658299 the most important thing for me is that you compete on the mound and that you give everything you have when you go out there
2658300 whether one guy is more media savvy than another i dont get too concerned about that its important that we know his heart not necessarily that everyone else does
2658301 all those times goofing around in my front yard i always put myself here in angel stadium
2658302 it was my first start here but in my head id done it a million times i felt really comfortable out there
2658303 he didnt show it but im sure on the inside he was probably a little nervous
2658304 you cant ask for him to do anything more than he did he was outstanding
2658305 he probably could have played friday if he had to but i thought it made more sense to make sure it was right theres a lot of things you do on your legs as a catcher so i wanted to give him the extra time
2658306 op onontwarbare manier gaan in de po zie inspiratie en berekening samen
2658307 en la poes a se combinan de manera inextricable la inspiraci n y el c lculo

2658311 accertato che in cina la politica forzata del figlio unico unita a una tradizione culturale che fa preferire i maschi sta producendo un forte squilibrio nel rapporto tra i sessi facendo saltare il naturale rapporto che vede mediamente 105 neonati ogni 100 neonate
2658312 la possibilit di determinare precocemente il sesso e il ricorso allaborto sono stati individuati come fattori rilevanti per tali situazioni tanto che queste pratiche sono state proibite con scarsi risultati
2658313 ha provato a verificare se anche in italia si manifesti una tendenza di questo tipo
2658314 vista la ristrettezza della presenza indiana e coreana nel nostro paese ci si concentrati sulla popolazione cinese
2658315 diversamente dal caso americano si basa su dati di fonte anagrafica necessariamente di livello locale e non nazionale
2658316 sono i comuni in cui la presenza di immigrati dal gigante asiatico tradizionalmente forte
2658317 sebbene non si abbia una prova vi unindicazione tale da lanciare un forte avvertimento in modo che si possano fare ulteriori indagini non solo attraverso le semplici analisi statistiche
2658318 i will go to china during the olympics and meet with foreign minister yang jiechi again
2658319 there is no doubt that sprouts are one of the healthiest foods you can consume because theyre considered a
2658320 my favourite flavours are apple pie banana cookie ginger snap chocolate and chocolate coffee
2658321 this loss is probably the best thing that could happen to him it will make him better
2658322 can you see me now can you see me now
2658323 i fell off the horse against frank mir but tonight i got on that stallion and rode out of town
2658324 i worked on everything every single day to become a better fighter and a contender in the ufc
2658325 i know how hard it is to fight roger huerta
2658326 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him he is strong and technical with his kicks hes tough as nails
2658327 he said he was going to come out strong and i was ready for it
2658328 i was surprised he went for the takedown so early
2658329 but he is a strong wrestler it was a tough fight
2658330 does anyone know a movie that features lawful concealed carry by a nonmilitary non leo citizen in a positive light id wager theyd be as rare as hens teeth
2658331 you ignoring me and my having to repeat myself asking over and over for extra sauce makes me look like an asshole and i dont like that
2658332 i can only hope that one day you have read this letter
2658333 when this recruitment drive is complete we will take the total number of police in wa to a new record of almost 6 000
2658334 research has shown that rate has now passed 25 per cent
2658335 its a fairly cold air stream so snow was likely in those places
2658336 there was snow this morning it started at about 6am and went on for about an hour and a half to two hours
2658337 now its just cloudy a bit overcast and real dark
2658338 there were a couple of cars that needed to be helped out of the snow
2658339 there is no snow on the ground in town but there is outside of town
2658340 i think the thing here with fuelwatch and obviously with grocerychoice is were about empowering people to make the best possible decisions
2658341 its one thing to wander yourself from supermarket to supermarket checking prices and many people do when theyre doing the weekly shop its another thing to have that information given to you in a convenient format thats what were trying to achieve
2658342 that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2658343 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2658344 treasurer wayne swan could learn from the shopsmart website how to provide information that is really relevant to shoppers
2658345 shopsmart also provides consumers a range of money saving and financial planning tips as well as a downloadable unit pricing matrix
2658346 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2658347 the liberal party ran around before the election drawing attention to that now they are trying to run around saying that wed said something different
2658348 the only people who give false promises are those who say things like we can keep interest rates at record lows promises they know they can never keep
2658349 i just want to sleep on it and talk to jordan and see how hes feeling

2658353 i dont think i wouldve been ready for it at 16
2658354 i dont think i was ready for it at 18 so i am sure we will send some blokes at him and see how he goes
2658355 any three wins in a row would be sensational because we havent done that since ive been here at the knights and that for obvious reasons would help with confidence
2658356 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2658357 if at the end of three years local government has not delivered on those building blocks i think there will be some really big questions to be asked about its capacity to commission these services in the future
2658358 theres blah blah blah going on do you want to go
2658359 i know you dont date but i mean if its like a casual thing

2658363 we just wanted to compete play hard play our game see what we could do
2658364 and i think thats all were going to do next i think i said earlier in the week to one of the reporters here that our first goal was to come here and compete and then it moved on and on and well just see how it goes

2658368 youre clearing the way for adrian peterson he does have ballcarrying abilities and exceptional hands out in the flat so i see him adjusting just fine

2658393 thanks to american military aid georgias 18 000 strong armed forces are the best trained and equipped fighting force in the caucasus
2658394 but it is one thing for them to defeat the raggle taggle militia of a tinpot place like south ossetia population 70 000 it is another for a country of less than five million people to take on russia population 142 million
2658395 reinforcements are pouring in and the kremlins mighty propaganda machine is lumbering into action while a cyber attack appears to have crippled georgias websites
2658396 together with military aid and training from the us britain and turkey and the experience of its forces in iraq this has helped to modernise and improve the professionalism of certain units

2658405 todays customers are sophisticated individuals with complex needs our extensive market research has revealed that customers want fast service and lots of available flights but above all we here at american airlines have discovered that they want planes that wont fucking kill them
2658406 once this is complete the entire northern shore of the tip of the peninsula will be protected forever
2658407 what is a high priority for the department is capturing peninsulas
2658408 its not the shoreline so much as the trees there thats the resting area even for butterflies
2658409 birds need intact habitat to fuel up and feed and then continue on their flight especially if they are getting ready to cross lake michigan

2658412 mdot said they made a mistake and theyre going to fix it but probably not until fall

2658414 we dont want to wait until someone has a crash
2658415 what weve had is some pretty dramatic reductions in our orders fr4om general motors and ford
2658416 its no secret thats going on in the auto market especially with trucks and suvs and 4 a gallon gas
2658417 id like to stress the ownership and the senior management personally do regret the necessity of these moves
2658418 were doing everything possible to solidify our future and diversify so the automotive cycles wont affect us so much
2658419 from the cadillac perspective the best way to term the impact is minimal
2658420 were dealing with a short term problem long term were well situated
2658421 this is a response to whats happening in north america
2658422 they have yet to award the re compete on that contract
2658423 its difficult with the economic times to make these decisions but unfortunately they have to be made
2658424 its vitally important we have the ability to find local sources for our equipment
2658425 right now were importing our turbines from germany and our towers from canada wi8th research and development and industrial support any of that equipment could be made in michigan
2658426 in this case yourre choosing to encourage energy that will help the environment
2658427 its a choice of what market you want to emphasize
2658428 one thing you do find is that people are slow to change
2658429 they dont want to move away from traditional markets unless they feel they absolutely have to
2658430 its not different technology that we have but theyve been working at it for a long time
2658431 wheres the opportunity in michigan where are the british thermal units where are we throwing btus away that can be captured with low tech equipment and turned into jobs
2658432 having a power plant is a major step toward implementing that work so cadillac is already well ahead
2658433 you can heat a jail if its nearby or city hall or the industrial park to attract new businesses by saying their heating bill is going to be cheap
2658434 america has lost a great deal of its foundry capabili8ty
2658435 you need to make huge parts and only a few companies in the country can do it
2658436 states passing a renewable portfolio standard have seen a significant boom for alternative energy uses
2658437 could we do it yes were not ready to make that commitment yet
2658438 we know how to build stuff we have a skilled workforce and there are outstanding precision machinging capabilities in the state
2658439 the wind industry is for real and it will have growth for a number of years

2658457 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain ive got my fingers crossed hopefully tomorrow will be better
2658458 the readings that we were looking at indicated that we have no cause for concern at this stage
2658459 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog right now im just knackered
2658460 we seem to be stuck in a weather pattern that is bringing us high humidity and higher than normal temperatures but despite all this the air quality continues to remain in the satisfactory range that does not pose any threat to the athletes

2658468 our only choice is the state which is the only reference for security and defense
2658469 we hope a true settlement will be reached over the defensive strategy after that the ministerial statement stressed the commitment to the un security council resolution
2658470 how could minorities be represented in a government including twenty four ministers and not be represented in a thirty minister government
2658471 however succarieyh rejected racist provocations against syrian and the calls for changing the syria regime
2658472 we fear that the cost of energy will be increased and this will influence big and small investors
2658473 we hope this phase will pave the way for political security and social stability and not only a cease fire after which the country will return to the state of chaos
2658474 the discussion over the defensive strategy must occur in calm climates and must be based on the higher interest of the country and away from politics
2658475 with all due respect to president michel sleiman and the content of his inauguration speech the ongoing recourse to the military institution reflects the failure of our practice of democracy and the ongoing violation of the constitution
2658476 i also call for considering the right of lebanese emigrants in participating in the legislative elections
2658477 i fear that the use of weapons will led to the use of the weapon of other militias
2658478 they were deceived by the performance of the security forces which failed in protecting them
2658479 it is in the interest of lebanon syria and all arabs to overcome disputes between march 8 and march 14 forces we are trying to calm things down and we dont want to return to the past
2658480 we must aggravate wounds but open a new page in the history of the country
2658481 as if they were in their respective countries and this is not acceptable
2658482 and so at last the beast fell and the unbelievers rejoiced but all was not lost for from the ash rose a great bird the bird gazed down upon the unbelievers and cast fire and thunder upon them for the beast had been reborn with its strength renewed and the followers of mammon cowered in horror
2658483 our goal because we are non profit isnt world domination
2658484 its just to make sure the internet is open collaborative competitive and innovative
2658485 mammon slept and the beast reborn spread over the earth and its numbers grew legion and they proclaimed the times and sacrificed crops unto the fire with the cunning of foxes and they built a new world in their own image as promised by the sacred words and spoke of the beast with their children mammon awoke and lo it was naught but a follower

2658498 the grand opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games on friday evening came as a big triumph not only for the chinese people but also for the people all around the world especially the friendly countries of the peoples republic of china including nepal
2658499 the four hour dazzling opening ceremony held amidst the presence of over 90 000 spectators including 80 heads of states and the government and over 10 000 athletes from 204 countries and regions depicted how well the chinese were prepared for holding the once in a lifetime olympics
2658500 during the seven years since beijing won the right to host the games china spent 40 billion dollars to build the venues expand transport networks and upgrade other infrastructures the preparation on such a vast scale within a period of seven years could have been impossible for many other countries but for china which has been enjoying a record high rate of economic growth for the past decade it was not a difficult task
2658501 through the grand opening ceremony with cultural shows expressing special traits of the chinese culture of both ancient and modern times the chinese people have sent the entire world a message of their growing economic strength putting aside all the political controversies and pollution concerns raised by the west in the recent months
2658502 indeed the chinese government as well as the people have succeeded to free the olympics from politics not only by successfully holding the opening ceremony but also by being host to world leaders including u s president george bush in the opening ceremony

2658504 save that the holy ghost witnesseth saying that bonds and afflictions abide me or wait for me in every city
2658505 i have no expectation of seeing you again i have every reason to suppose that this is my final interview with you
2658506 that thou art teaching all the jews among kata the gentiles the jews of the dispersion as in act 2 9 apostasy from moses
2658507 in the eyes of the church at jerusalem this was a far more serious matter than the previous question at the conference about the status of gentile converts
2658508 will change the customs ethe the very word used here which moses delivered unto us
2658509 the rites of the mosaic economy the offering of sacrifices incense the oblations anointings festivals etc which the law of moses prescribed
2658510 it was also customary for the richer sort to bestow their charity on the poorer sort for this purpose for josephus ant lib xix cap 6 sec 1 observes that agrippa on his being advanced from a prison to a throne by the emperor claudius came to jerusalem and there among other instances of his religious thankfulness shown in the temple he ordered very many nazarites to be shaven he furnishing them with money for the expenses of that and of the sacrifices necessarily attending it
2658511 if he shaved in the city it was excusable but whether he shaved in the city or in the sanctuary under the pot his hair must be cast and he did not shave until the door of the court was opened as it is said
2658512 he that says upon me be the shaving of a nazarite he is bound to bring the offerings of shaving for purification and he may offer them by the hand of what nazarite he pleases he that says upon me be half the offerings of a nazarite or if he says upon me be half the shaving of a nazarite he brings half the offerings by what nazarite he will and that nazarite perfects his offerings out of that which is his
2658513 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law
2658514 as having four towers from one of which the whole temple was overlooked and that one of the towers was joined to the porticoes of the temple and had a double pair of stairs from it by which soldiers in the garrison were used to come down with their arms to the porticoes on the festival days to keep the people quiet for as the temple was a guard to the city so this castle was a guard to the temple
2658515 to me very plain that the place where the jews were about to kill paul was the court of the gentiles the porticoes being there and that the chief captain came down there to his rescue
2658516 on the north side of the wall was built a four square tower well fortified and strong this the kings and priests of the asmonaean race who were before herod built and called it baris that there the priestly robe might be laid up by them which the high priest only wore when he was concerned in divine service
2658517 upon the north side and joining up to the western angle but on the outside of the wall stood the tower of antonia once the place where the high priests used to lay up their holy garments but in after times a garrison of roman soldiers for the a wing of the temple when it served for the former use it was called baris it may be from
2658518 in order to have knowledge of all things we went up to a castle adjoining to the city which is situated in a very high place fortified with very high towers built with large stones as we supposed for the preservation of the places about the temple if there should be any lying in wait or tumult or enemies should enter so that none might be able to make way in at the walls about the temple for in the towers of the castle lay very sharp darts and various instruments and the place was upon a very great eminence
2658519 was situated at the corner of two cloisters of the temple of that on the west and of that on the north it was erected on a rock of 50 cubits 75 feet in height and was on a great precipice on the corner where it joined to the two cloisters of the temple it had passages down to them both through which the guards went several ways among the cloisters with their arms on the jewish festivals etc
2658520 these he led round about from the wilderness to the mount which was called the mount of olives and was ready to break into jerusalem by force from that place but felix who was apprised of his movements marched against him with the roman soldiers and defeated him and killed 400 of them and took 200 alive but the egyptian escaped himself out of the fight but did not appear anymore
2658521 tharsus gave name to the tharsians for so cilicia was formerly called of which this is an evidence for the most famous of the cities with them and which is the metropolis is called tarsus theta being changed into tau for appellation sake

2658593 he resigned from his job he was jobless before he committed the crime
2658594 if you judge people you have no time to love them
2658595 lamentablemente mi conclusi n es que ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2658596 varios miembros del consejo expresaron su firme apoyo a los esfuerzos de mediaci n internacionales particularmente los de la organizaci n para la seguridad y cooperaci n en europa osce y la uni n europea ue
2658597 cu nta gente tiene que morir all para que llamemos a esto un genocidio
2658598 creo que ya no estamos en un punto en el que el consejo de seguridad pueda adoptar un texto importante
2658599 ste es un conflicto que se est descontrolando y el motivo es la intervenci n en masa de fuerzas exteriores
2658600 nos preocupa particularmente que el conflicto parecer estar extendi ndose m s all de osetia del sur hasta abjasia

2658602 por gestiones del secretario general de gobierno y con la autorizaci n del gobernador se nos otorg esa cantidad para equipamiento se compraron algunos equipos de atenci n de emergencias por supuesto ya est n listos para ser utilizados
2658603 se aprob un apoyo por parte de seguridad p blica a protecci n civil tienen un programa del fondo de seguridad y de all se destin una parte para el equipamiento no es algo extra o porque en un gran porcentaje los sistemas estatales de protecci n civil dependen de la secretar a de seguridad p blica e incluso en algunas entidades secretar a general de gobierno es s lo un coordinador
2658604 fueron decisiones que tomaron los asesores y tambi n expertos en paisajismo urbano que nos recomendaron este tipo de sinton a visual comparado con otros centros coloniales de ciudades del pa s
2658605 pudiera ser que s por la rugosidad que se tiene pero por eso hemos tratado de manejar reas especiales para discapacitados y de esa manera aminorar las molestias
2658606 dando poco menos desorden en lo visual en lo que es la reparaci n
2658607 hay que reconocerlo con toda sinceridad tenemos pocos o nada de avances se han realizado diligencias se ha entrevistado gente visitado y revisado lugares nos hemos apoyado con otras corporaciones y con otras procuradur as pero no hemos tenido resultados

2658610 juan fue perseguido por sus ideas juan bustos fue v ctima de la barbarie organizada del estado y hoy d a es el estado pero aquel ahora reencontrado con sus verdaderas tradiciones y su esencia libertaria la que le rinde honores y despide como autoridad democr tica porque los honores de estado hay que merecerlos y juan bustos ciertamente los merece

2658619 del 2004 al 2007 aument en un 60 por ciento el n mero de gasolineras claro que esto nos repercute ya que entre m s estaciones hay menos volumen que vendemos se reparte la venta el incremento de las estaciones debe ser de acuerdo al n mero de veh culos pero no se ha respetado eso hay demasiadas en durango
2658620 s lo como un ejemplo hay una gasolinera por el colegio de ciencias y humanidades y otra est a dos kil metros pero en medio est n abriendo otra
2658621 desde el punto de vista legislativo tenemos varios temas pendientes pero destaco dos la reforma penal que sigue implement ndose y sigue su curso va a tener un trabajo protag nico en esta segunda parte del 2008
2658622 en lo federal se le dio al ife instituto federal electoral y nosotros tenemos que ver en lo local c mo trabajamos en esas reglas

2658637 im ready to fight everybody everybody who deserves a shot
2658638 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him hes very very tough
2658639 it makes sense to have greater cooperation but i dont think were ready to have one global super regulator
2658640 i suspect it would take longer than ten years for people to go back to that level of risk
2658641 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2658642 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2658643 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible
2658644 were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family

2658647 re what to get my son for his 1st birthday how about a book maybe something with his name as the title or one of the characters we
2658648 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2658649 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2658650 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2658651 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2658652 its so cooperative whether its people airing their grievances or reporting some social inequities or telling us about a crime in progress
2658653 thats the thing that if anyone can develop they can be successful
2658654 its been very hard for me to have a normal relationship
2658655 a lot of neighborhood boards werent covered until we came around so were just showing up
2658656 thats the promise of hyperlocal journalism as opposed to blogging
2658657 just about every community on long island has a weekly newspaper including some excellent ones on the east end in particular
2658658 and there are good papers on the south shore also that could make a big difference
2658659 im not saying its the most important issue in the world but for the first time joe blow could interact with assemblymen the mayor and get their opinions posted
2658660 plenty of artists take their interview and theyre out the door
2658661 but others keep reading seeing me at shows who like what i do and like anything else you develop a friend
2658662 was for some reason really big in hungary for a while
2658663 and i correspond with a couple of people in japan germany
2658664 certain types of cases would be tried and that others would not be tried because of political factors such as whether they would capture the imagination of the american people be sexy or involve blood on the hands of the accused
2658665 the required independence from the prosecution function to provide fair and objective legal advice to the court
2658666 and youre also seeing a lot of health issues from kids not building a fort out back or playing on the stoop and their neighborhood
2658667 i think its responding to a number of anxieties out there
2658668 the next generation is the one thats going to make or break us as a planet
2658669 not one person ive ever talked to doesnt think this is a good idea
2658670 this is really a product of thousands of educators pushing congress to get at it
2658671 youre sitting at a desk in rows youre engaging a couple of your senses if you go outside you engage all your senses
2658672 its so important to look at the education of the child in terms of the environment
2658673 weve got this growing crisis on our hands where weve got these kids magnetized to the computer
2658674 this idea is really catching fire all over the country we want our parks to be not just parks but learning laboratories for kids
2658675 kids are lacking the time outside kids come to summer camp and they get a little free time outside to play and they dont know how to do it anymore
2658676 de politie vond deze persoon vrijdagavond in goede gezondheid terug na een nachtrust heeft hij zijn reis voortgezet
2658677 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2658678 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2658679 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2658680 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2658681 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2658682 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2658683 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2658684 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2658685 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2658686 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2658687 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2658688 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2658689 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2658690 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2658691 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2658692 from the very start patric had told me he had gone to prison he told me to google him and i did i knew he went to prison and i knew why
2658693 that was his past i chose to not judge him but i did not know he was on a probation violation
2658694 weve all made mistakes everyone deserves a second chance everyone
2658695 i dont know the patric from the past the patric i know is the one now
2658696 patric was detail orientated he would get stressed and he would yell at times
2658697 how would you like it if i put gasoline on your front porch
2658698 the whole thing was a sham hes not boy about town hes patric who ran from florida and ripped off the red cross
2658699 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2658700 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2658701 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2658702 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2658703 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2658704 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2658705 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2658706 most are students reaching out for help some are from people reaching out to support the program while we cannot help all those looking for help the added resources will help us to continue the program
2658707 many of our parents arent able to donate so it makes a big difference when members of the greater community direct their tax credit contributions to our school
2658708 thanks to the mention in your column our tax credit donations increased significantly
2658709 we benefited from ideas gained from the article regarding parent involvement strategies in other schools
2658710 going into the ready room i started getting these chills in my body right then and there i knew i was ready
2658711 wasnt comfortable after the first 200 with everybody so close together
2658712 i was pretty emotional after that race i looked up and saw him waving the american flag and that was pretty special
2658713 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2658714 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2658715 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2658716 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2658717 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2658718 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2658719 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2658720 there in the corner stand and shes looking real pretty just waitin for her clientele
2658721 video konnte nicht geladen werden grund meta information es handelt sich um markus ruf von den schweizer demokraten leider ist das video im moment irgendwie
2658722 t he death penalty which is unique in its severity and irrevocability is an excessive penalty for the rapist who as such does not take human life
2658723 congress must clearly reassert the constitutional principle that only the peoples representatives have the authority to send american men and women to war and courts should stand ready to assess whether these decisions have been lawfully made failure to do so may well result in a future president exercising what by default has come to be seen as the presidents unilateral authority
2658724 fully competent to perform an independent review of executive branch assertions of the state secrets privilege
2658725 if our courts are to continue their best tradition of constitutional guardianship
2658726 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2658727 in 2000 george w bush and dick cheney were not asked about presidential power and they volunteered nothing about their attitude toward the issue to voters yet once in office they immediately began seeking out ways to concentrate more unchecked power in the white house not just for themselves but also for their successors
2658728 the accretion of presidential power history has shown often acts as a one way ratchet it can be increased far more easily than it can be reduced
2658729 expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the central intelligence agency
2658730 the system treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent
2658731 tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations
2658732 w ith impunity prosecutors across the country have violated their oaths and the law committing the worst kinds of deception in the most serious of cases they have prosecuted black men hiding evidence the real killers were white they have prosecuted a wife hiding evidence her husband committed suicide they have prosecuted parents hiding evidence their daughter was killed by wild dogs they do it to win they do it because they wont get punished
2658733 too often the distressing reality is that it takes wealth to ensure effective lawyering and that those with insufficient resources end up with inexperienced and under resourced or even no lawyers
2658734 will permit warrantless surveillance of american citizens when one party to the conversation may be outside of the united states it is the most dramatic change in the 30 year history of the fisa and will leave millions of americans subject to electronic surveillance without court review regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing
2658735 w hile there are things people may have to give up in trying fiscal times justice cannot and must not be one of them
2658736 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2658737 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2658738 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2658739 you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide
2658740 think about whether you have or maybe someone you know really well has ever entered a psychiatrists office or a fertility clinic or an alcoholics anonymous meeting or maybe the meeting or some non traditional political or religious group now you dont need to raise your hands this time but i want you to think again how many are really comfortable having your entire daily life captured on video footage for government officials to view
2658741 not to countermand or interfere with the special prosecutors decisions or actions
2658742 it will never be my time for romantic lasting relationship
2658743 i loved you so much more than i ever loved anyone
2658744 if you love someone set them free if they come back theyre yours if they dont they never were

2658746 you dont get a 2 nd chance to make a 1 st impression
2658747 i would appreciate if you would talk to me first
2658748 yeah they dont pay rent they dont clean they rarely take out the trash theyre up all night and sleep all day im a prisoner in my own home
2658749 im sorry i fucked this up with my utter lack of responsibility

2658757 my fathers a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying hens one time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess
2658758 our family are farmers too but we raise chickens for the meat market we had a dozen eggs one time but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral to this story is dont count your chickens until theyre hatched
2658759 that was a fine story lucy johnny do you have a story to share
2658760 yes maam my daddy told me this story about my uncle bob uncle bob was a green beret in vietnam and his helicopter got hit he had to crash land in enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey a machine gun and a machete he drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldnt break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops he killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands
2658761 what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story
2658762 dont f ck with uncle bob when hes been drinking

2658778 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2658779 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2658780 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2658781 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2658782 katakanlah wahai muhammad jika kamu sembunyikan apa yang ada dalam dada kamu atau kamu melahirkannya nescaya allah mengetahuinya dan dia mengetahui segala yang ada di langit dan yang ada di bumi dan allah maha kuasa atas tiap tiap sesuatu
2658783 dan janganlah kamu campur adukkan yang benar itu dengan yang salah dan kamu sembunyikan yang benar itu pula padahal kamu semua mengetahuinya 42
2658784 sesungguhnya mereka yang menentangmu wahai muhammad bermati mati menjalankan rancangan jahat 15
2658785 bukankah tuhanmu telah menjadikan rancangan jahat mereka dalam keadaan yang rugi dan memusnahkan mereka 2

2658796 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2658797 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2658798 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2658799 hi chris we wanted to send you our dogs picture but we noticed that you usually only feature deformed animals on your show so we
2658800 these girls have a great chance to make an impact on their varsity teams as freshmen
2658801 what a great goal she is just so good at dribbling and beating people
2658802 when i tell strikers jessica bertucci coryn bajema and kelli bannerman who scored against willamette about something they need to do its like telling myself what to do too
2658803 its a great way to remind me what i need to do to help our team at western
2658804 claire is the big sister for our girls and shes a calming force for when i get too excited
2658805 she has such a huge impact i cant say enough about what claire brings to our team shes a great balancing force
2658806 we can joke off the field but we take it seriously on the field in practice and games
2658807 everything was on my mind after the goal i couldnt even remember what happened
2658808 i think theyll all battle for varsity spots as freshmen
2658809 our girls have been even better than i expected this summer
2658810 they put everything on the line for each other and they really are fun to watch
2658811 the little things that can mean so much in soccer
2658812 heres claire out there telling the girls about what they can expect in the way of field conditions
2658813 its such a huge benefit for the team with claires youthful ambition the girls really can relate to her so well she is just a great mentor
2658814 i like the new rule i think it will be good for the high school teams
2658815 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2658816 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2658817 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2658818 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2658819 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2658820 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2658821 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2658822 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2658823 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2658824 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2658825 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2658826 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2658827 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2658828 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2658829 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2658830 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2658831 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2658832 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2658833 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2658834 those statistics are true but that doesnt discourage me that tells me how much work weve got to do and how much help is needed
2658835 if you dont have a relationship with these students theres no way that you can tell them about not skipping school about teenage pregnancy or about going to school everyday and about any other life issues
2658836 i know if theres a gang fight on saturday that is going to spill over on monday because i know the gang members because im in the community i can speak to them before they get to school on monday i can warn the teachers principals and police
2658837 it will help the kids motivate them to go to school and do what they need to do
2658838 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2658839 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2658840 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2658841 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2658842 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2658843 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2658844 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2658845 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2658846 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2658847 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2658848 this is sounding more and more like the republican convention of 1976
2658849 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2658850 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2658851 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2658852 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2658853 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2658854 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2658855 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2658856 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2658857 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2658858 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2658859 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2658860 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2658861 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2658862 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2658863 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2658864 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2658865 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2658866 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2658867 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2658868 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2658869 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2658870 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2658871 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2658872 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2658873 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2658874 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2658875 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2658876 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2658877 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2658878 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2658879 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2658880 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2658881 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2658882 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2658883 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2658884 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2658885 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2658886 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2658887 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2658888 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2658889 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2658890 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2658891 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2658892 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2658893 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2658894 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2658895 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2658896 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2658897 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2658898 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2658899 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2658900 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2658901 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2658902 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2658903 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2658904 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2658905 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2658906 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2658907 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2658908 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2658909 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2658910 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2658911 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2658912 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2658913 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2658914 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2658915 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2658916 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2658917 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2658918 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2658919 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2658920 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2658921 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2658922 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2658923 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2658924 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2658925 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2658926 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2658927 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2658928 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2658929 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2658930 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2658931 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2658932 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2658933 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2658934 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2658935 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2658936 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2658937 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2658938 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2658939 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2658940 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2658941 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2658942 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2658943 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2658944 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2658945 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2658946 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2658947 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2658948 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2658949 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2658950 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2658951 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2658952 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2658953 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2658954 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2658955 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2658956 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2658957 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2658958 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2658959 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2658960 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2658961 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2658962 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2658963 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2658964 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2658965 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2658966 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2658967 just so you all know we did set a record
2658968 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2658969 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2658970 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2658971 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2658972 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2658973 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2658974 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2658975 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2658976 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2658977 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2658978 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2658979 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2658980 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2658981 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2658982 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2658983 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2658984 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2658985 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2658986 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2658987 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2658988 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2658989 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2658990 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2658991 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2658992 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2658993 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2658994 but in the past couple weeks i was turning the fastest lap times of my life so thats a pretty good sign
2658995 but nothing could match the absolutely unabated response i had to seeing taylor with the u s team screaming with delight
2658996 when i raced here in december i was like yeah were going to be racing at the olympic velodrome
2658997 and now im on bike paths and the best athletes in the world are passing me its cool
2658998 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2658999 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2659000 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2659001 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2659002 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2659003 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2659004 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2659005 there will be more celebrities in denver than there were when the democratic convention was in los angeles eight years ago america understands celebrity and these people will be there to see obama it will help generate the kind of excitement we want to see
2659006 there will be photocalls with some of the bigger names and there are plans being worked out for ben affleck and matt damon to do some sort of gig on the stage
2659007 obama cant avoid hollywood even if he wanted to they have raised so much money for him
2659008 he was getting blasted last week for behaving like a blonde bimbo and what does he do he sends out gwyneth paltrow to do a get out the vote video it was like saying my blonde bimbo is better than yours
2659009 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2659010 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2659011 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2659012 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2659013 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2659014 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2659015 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2659016 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2659017 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2659018 we are extremely pleased to complete the filing of these delayed annual and quarterly reports with the sec today
2659019 i appreciate the dedication and diligence of our team in accomplishing this critical goal we will now be able to fully focus on the key operational initiatives required to improve our business performance and maximize the long term potential of the company
2659020 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2659021 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2659022 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2659023 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2659024 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2659025 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2659026 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2659027 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2659028 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2659029 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2659030 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2659031 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2659032 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2659033 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2659034 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2659035 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2659036 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2659037 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2659038 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2659039 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2659040 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2659041 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2659042 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2659043 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2659044 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2659045 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2659046 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2659047 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2659048 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2659049 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2659050 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2659051 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2659052 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2659053 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2659054 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2659055 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2659056 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2659057 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2659058 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2659059 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2659060 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2659061 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2659062 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2659063 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2659064 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2659065 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2659066 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2659067 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2659068 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2659069 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2659070 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2659071 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2659072 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2659073 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2659074 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2659075 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2659076 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2659077 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2659078 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2659079 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2659080 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2659081 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2659082 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2659083 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2659084 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2659085 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2659086 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2659087 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2659088 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2659089 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2659090 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2659091 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2659092 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2659093 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2659094 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2659095 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2659096 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2659097 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2659098 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2659099 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2659100 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2659101 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2659102 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2659103 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2659104 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2659105 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2659106 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2659107 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2659108 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2659109 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2659110 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2659111 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2659112 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2659113 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2659114 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2659115 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2659116 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2659117 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2659118 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2659119 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2659120 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2659121 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2659122 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2659123 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2659124 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2659125 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2659126 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2659127 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2659128 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2659129 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2659130 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2659131 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2659132 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2659133 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2659134 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2659135 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2659136 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2659137 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2659138 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2659139 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2659140 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2659141 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2659142 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2659143 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2659144 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2659145 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2659146 so the great thing is that professional golf might just be on the edge of seeing the end of long rough

2659151 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2659152 putin was saying we are going to make them pay
2659153 then putin flew from beijing to a region that borders south ossetia arriving after an announcement that georgia was pulling its troops out of the breakaway regions capital he appeared ostensibly to coordinate assistance to refugees who had fled south ossetia into russia but the russian message was clear this is our sphere of influence others stay out since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2659154 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2659155 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2659156 there is none there is not a danger of a regional conflict in our mind
2659157 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2659158 basierte als kr uter habe ich estragon schafgarbe und ringelblumenbl tter verwendet und die sauce mit etwas muskat abgeschmeckt das passte sehr gut

2659160 one of the attractions of facebook is that you can find out so much about someone before you even date them
2659161 their friends their profile their likes and dislikes and the way they present themselves tells you everything you want to know about them
2659162 no it spoils my hair and i dont like the rain drops on my glasses
2659163 they mimic the playground insecurities of primary school kids piling up best friends to find their social niche
2659164 when people grow up and settle down they realise that real friendship isnt about turning on the computer it requires real effort and taking the rough with the smooth
2659165 for me its more than just a website it is a huge and very important part of my social life
2659166 facebook is like another world and the time flies by when im online
2659167 sometimes itll be 2am john has gone to bed and there i am still online
2659168 then a few hours later ill have to get up to feed harry and i am shattered
2659169 it is like your own soap there is always some snippet of news or someone uploading must see photos
2659170 its the ultimate in nosiness if someone says the pictures of their new holiday are up i just have to see them
2659171 what were they wearing what does their house look like facebook is the ultimate gossip and thats why women like it so much
2659172 in the mornings i even pop on the pc for the few minutes it takes to heat up harrys breakfast cereal and whenever hes playing happily i use the time for a quick facebook check
2659173 i always long for harry to nap longer so i can have some more quality time on facebook and at night after putting harry to bed i am bursting to go online
2659174 so after dinner i sneak off to the office in our house only to find john following me
2659175 he will stand over me while im responding to people on facebook as if to say when will you be finished
2659176 it does make me feel guilty because i know i should be spending time with john i want to as well its just that if someone has contacted me i feel compelled to respond straightaway
2659177 i remember him being very cross when i uploaded photos of a romantic holiday we went on
2659178 there was one particular picture of us kissing which i felt said everything about how we feel about one another
2659179 but john was furious saying it was private and that i shouldnt have put it on facebook for everyone to see
2659180 not a minute goes by when one of them isnt sending a comment to me or uploading some new photos or video for me
2659181 consequently i find there is always something new to look at
2659182 it is riveting and very addictive facebook is such a huge part of my life that its hard to recall what it was like when i didnt have it its my constant companion
2659183 these days i have no idea what is on television because i never watch it
2659184 instead as soon as i get up in the morning the first thing i check is my facebook site
2659185 from then on its on all day and its the last thing i check before going to bed at night
2659186 last year i went on holiday to tenerife and turkey but i still managed to check facebook every day in an internet caf or on my phone i was desperate to know what was going on back home
2659187 i have looked at facebook and am depressed by the triviality of it
2659188 it is all how do you feel i have got a hangover that sort of stuff
2659189 it seems that people find they have to trivialise their lives somewhat
2659190 some of the conversations are so banal things you wouldnt even say at the water cooler because if you did the other person would roll their eyes and shut you up
2659191 there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of this happening
2659192 once theyve heard your troubles they turn round and laugh at you it has left people feeling very hurt and even tipped some over into depression
2659193 that way he could see which clubs and parties id been to and who i was with
2659194 if i was not online when he was he demanded to know why not
2659195 in the end facebook split us up he found a photo that a friend had uploaded to the site with me smiling next to a guy
2659196 i had no idea who this man was it had just been a random photo taken on a night out
2659197 but tim became convinced i was lying and that i was somehow connected to this man he wouldnt listen to any explanations and stormed off out of my life
2659198 and the definitive variorum edition of the cantos which would be the function of the future
2659199 be made more easily comprehensible to a sizable audience of students and professors as well as critics
2659200 is not for pound scholars who do not need it it is a handbook for new students of the cantos who need it badly therefore it is not designed as a complete compendium of present knowledge about the cantos with exegeses and analyses of the text such a 10 volume work must be left to the future the book is designed for the beginner so as to 1 answer his first and most immediate questions 2 tell him where to go next for exegesis and comment 3 tell him where to go to find the sources ep used
2659201 the cantos is a great religious poem an account of mans progress from the darkness of hell to the light of paradise thus it is a revelation of how divinity is manifested in the universe
2659202 opted for a musical thematic structure rather than the more traditional historical or narrative structure
2659203 p viii hence the need of the reader for extensive glosses

2659210 but i think there was still a little bit of apprehension we know it was better in his rehab game with triple a las vegas on aug 2 it could have been the cool weather or whatever if it stays there obviously we may have to look at it but well see when he throws his side if its any better
2659211 its an amazing achievement with four young girls whove come a very long way in four years
2659212 i think i might be older than her parents but im not sure
2659213 i met her for the first time i hadnt even met libby before
2659214 it was nice to meet them she campbell looked just so young and innocent
2659215 when were in the water i know the water doesnt know what age you are so it doesnt really matter when you hit the water
2659216 that race hurt more than any other 400 medley ive done
2659217 finishing the race i really had to try and take in a few big deep breaths and just sort of concentrate
2659218 i think coming into the race i just didnt want to have any regrets i know ive done everything i can with preparation
2659219 i dont have anything that i look back on and think i could have done better
2659220 whatever time and whatever place i got today i would have been proud of
2659221 i guess it hasnt really kicked in for me but i know its such an amazing achievement
2659222 i was trying not to think about the end of the race it was more about the process
2659223 going into that race ive never been able to race kirsty coventry and katie hoff and all those girls
2659224 so it was a new race for me and something i had to really go in to with a different mindset and really focus on my own race because everyone has different strengths
2659225 what happens outside the pool is no one elses business
2659226 thats not something that im really concerned about my focus has been purely on swimming
2659227 and this is something that ive looked forward to since i was a really young girl
2659228 so to be able to represent my country is just something that i love the feeling of
2659229 i looked unhappy but i was just trying to maintain my composure
2659230 she stepped in and helped in any way she could whether hosting meetings or with her philanthropy
2659231 everything i am seeing suggests that australians are very very popular in china
2659232 i did things a little better this morning so hopefully i can do that again tomorrow morning
2659233 i feel ive prepared myself very well so its just about putting together good races and hopefully finishing up on the podium
2659234 ive come here to win medals and to race hard against the best swimmers in the world
2659235 i did that well this morning and hopefully i can do it well again tomorrow morning
2659236 to take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world
2659237 will strengthen the iraqi civil aviation capacity and enable it to respond to the increasing demand for air transportation to and from iraq
2659238 michigans u s sen carl levin chairman of the armed services committee raised that very good question this month in a letter cosigned by sen john warner of virginia the bipartisan duo wants an accounting and american taxpayers are entitled to one
2659239 that we are paying for the reconstruction of iraq with american taxpayers dollars if iraqi oil sales to a significant degree are going into foreign banks and not being used for their own reconstruction
2659240 when does he end i want to see if the headlights of my cars are switched off and tommy the dog needs feeding
2659241 our hours are hard and violence is used against us if we dont work hard enough this is a big order for abroad they keep telling us that
2659242 last week we spent four days working from dawn until about one o
2659243 if any of us cried we were hit with a rubber pipe some of the boys had oily cloths stuffed in our mouths as punishment
2659244 i want to work here i have somewhere to sleep
2659245 the boss tells me i am learning it is my duty to stay here im learning to be a man and work eventually i will make money and buy a house for my mother
2659246 at gap we firmly believe that under no circumstances is it acceptable for children to produce or work on garments
2659247 a story of horror unparalleled in the history of industrial warfare
2659248 we were ordered to go they forcibly brought us to iraq
2659249 they would lock them in without documents no passports or ids
2659250 pensamos que una banda nueva no te iba a interesar
2659251 the public of the arab world is not looking at the important issues through the divide
2659252 they see them rather through the lens of israeli palestinian issues and anger with u s policy in the region most sunni arabs take the side of the shias on the important issues
2659253 as in the past several years large majorities of arabs attribute less benign objectives to u
2659254 i am a full time grad student and got involved with jump start i am doing my thesis about the fields being bulldozed in gaza
2659255 i am seeking the truth and i know the american media hasnt been reporting it
2659256 i am a usa taxpayer and want to know where my money is going and for what
2659257 undertake a full fair and expeditious investigation into rachels death
2659258 i actually agreed with ny times columnist david brooks the other day he wrote the us has always exercised as much power as it could but while he celebrated this fact i thought about american hegemony and hypocrisy
2659259 iran has signed the npt which allows them the right to have nuclear power and to enrich uranium the 185 non nuclear states have agreed to give up the right to have nuclear weapons and the five nuclear powers that signed the npt agreed to get rid of their nuclear weapons iran is not in violation of the npt but america is the usa has been in violation ever since the day they signed it the usa is acting like a rogue state the rhetoric out of washington the arresting of iranian diplomats in iraq are deliberate provocations hoping that the iranians will take the bait and respond the usa is trying to build a coalition of moderates who are the ones we like which all happen to be monarchies and dictatorships
2659260 i grew up in west new york in a christian fundamentalist home steeped in the christian zionism theology particular to the scofield bible
2659261 briefly stated christian zionism is a movement within protestant fundamentalism that understands the modern state of the country region israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and thus deserving of political financial and religious support christian zionists work closely with the israeli government religious and secular jewish zionist organizations and are particularly empowered during periods when the more conservative likud party is in control of the knesset both the secular and religious media place christian zionists within the larger protestant evangelical movement which claims upwards of 100 125 million supporters in the united states to be more precise christian zionism should be placed within the fundamentalist wing of protestant christianity as the evangelical movement is far large and more diverse in its theology and historical development
2659262 we have it in our power to begin the world again
2659263 afinal de contas o departamento de criar n o nenhum uso
2659264 this is a big day for vietnamese and for catholics
2659265 i was from a poor white family from the south and i did badly in school
2659266 i was filet mignon for recruiters they started phoning me when i was in 10th grade
2659267 i stand before you today with the strength and clarity and resolve to declare to the military my government and the world that this soldier will not be deploying to iraq
2659268 my decision is based on my desire to no longer continue violating my core values to support an illegal and unconstitutional occupation i refuse to participate in the iraq occupation
2659269 everyone who manages a blog facebook or myspace out of iraq has to register every video picture document of any event they do on mission
2659270 youre almost always denied before you are allowed to send them home
2659271 hard facts and slice them into small pieces to make them presentable to the secretary of state or the president and all with the intent of furthering the occupation of iraq
2659272 i cannot deploy to iraq carry a weapon and not be part of the problem
2659273 i noticed your emotions and the times you werent able to control your eyes and expressions why are you so affected more so than many attending
2659274 perforating gunshot wound of the head and manner of death was suicide
2659275 born to be a warrior i desire these answers not just for philosophical reasons but for self knowledge
2659276 the sum of what he saw going on drove him
2659277 its because he believed in duty honor country that hes dead
2659278 strength of character was teds defining characteristic it was unflinching integrity
2659279 to be a true flaw the personality has to have great strength and that characteristic caused his downfall
2659280 im beyond their timid lying morality and so im beyond caring you have all my faith your loving father
2659281 he was a devout catholic who went to church nearly every sunday he had a wife and three young children
2659282 you dresed me up for battle when all i want is peace those of us who pay the price come home with the least
2659283 what a bunch of dumbasses what the hell does iraq have to do with any of it what happened to afghanistan and werent most of the 911 crowd saudis holy shit hitler was right the masses are as stupid as they are forgetful
2659284 there are no weapons of mass destruction this is about oil a sitting presidents desire to get into the history books and the destablization of the entire middle east and secondarily about crushing the jewel of the middle east
2659285 look the best thing we could do as a nation with all our skill and money is rebuild the towers within six months bigger and better than it was in that way we could show off our strength of character will and determination and the towers would become that symbol that terrorism cant work here
2659286 ted westhusing is just one among tens of thousands four years of warfare have decimated iraq its economy and infrastructure are in ruins tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of iraqis are dead
2659287 your government has no honor you have to forgive yourself
2659288 he was accepted at notre dame and duke he chose west point
2659289 his formal title was director counter terrorism special operations civilian police assistance training team multi national security transition command iraq
2659290 secondly those who favour this attack now will tell you candidly and privately that it is probably true that saddam hussein is no threat to the united states
2659291 but they are afraid at some point he might decide if he had a nuclear weapon to use it against israel
2659292 the real agenda in all of this of course was to redraw the political map of the middle east
2659293 i think there are a number of issues at play theres a number of competing agendas one is the remaking of the map of the middle east for israeli security and my fear is that when it becomes increasingly apparent that this was all done to make sharons life easier and that american soldiers are dying in order to enable sharon to impose his terms upon the palestinians that people will wonder why it is american boys and girls are dying for israel and that will undercut a strategic relationship and a moral obligation that weve had towards israel for 55 years i think its a terribly flawed strategy
2659294 already exceeded the very lofty expectations that all had for you
2659295 in september 2005 the armys inspector general concluded an investigation into allegations raised in the anonymous letter to westhusing shortly before his death
2659296 the context placement and relative size of the redacted names strongly suggest that they refer to petraeus and fil
2659297 last november fil returned to iraq he is now the commanding general of the multinational division in baghdad and of the 1st cavalry division on february 12 petraeus took command of all u s forces in iraq he now wears four stars
2659298 krilin por favor no lo mates he visto que es muy fuerte dejalo ir para que se vuelva m s poderoso en el futuro

2659304 we are only taking actions against the breakaway milf group that defied the orders of the ceasefire panels
2659305 we dont know what will happen next but this will certainly have an adverse impact on peace talks
2659306 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2659307 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2659308 hes one of us he has brought about such change like nationalization
2659309 lots of people have come to offer sacrifices to pachamama mother earth for evo
2659310 the government is a satellite of hugo chavez and wants to impose a constitution that centralizes destroys institutions and the economy

2659352 it was great were really happy with our performance we came up with an australian record
2659353 third is nothing to be sneezed at im proud to be part of this team and get on the podium again
2659354 the poll is further and dramatic evidence that as the snp delivers good government in the devolved areas so support for scotland to be governed equally well in all areas with independence is surging
2659355 people want a government that will speak up for scotland not shut up for london it is a tremendous boost for the snp in the run up to our conference next week it will have our opponents choking on their cornflakes
2659356 this bill will bring about important changes in the law governing the legal professions it provides for enhanced oversight through the full independent review of the operation of the legal profession complaints systems by way of a legal services ombudsman the ombudsman will ensure real improvements in the quality control of the delivery of legal services and the manner in which the public perceives such control to exist the government is anxious that regulation of the legal professions is improved and strengthened the enactment of this bill in addition to the existing forms of oversight will ensure that the highest of standards are maintained in the legal professions as the bill progresses through the oireachtas i will consider any practical amendment to the bill that complements the overarching purpose of this piece of legislation the improved regulation of the legal professions
2659357 honestly it was not quite a tough match yesterday was tougher and more exhausted than today
2659358 we led in the first game 17 15 in the first game but they managed to take over the control and tied 19 19 before closing the game 21 19 in the second game they played much better than us
2659359 since yesterday i thought we would leave the games the russian political leaders our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this
2659360 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2659361 piye was the first of the so called black pharaohs a series of nubian kings who ruled over all of egypt for three quarters of a century as that countrys 25th dynasty
2659362 nubians are clearly noted as the ones who ruled egypt during the pramid years
2659363 i noted that they ruled during the pyramid building years
2659364 like which famous pyramids i havent seen any evidence of intensified pyramid building during those 75 years out of the thousands of years of egypts history
2659365 the company paid 10 5 billion in income taxes in the second quarter 9 5 billion in sales taxes and over 12 billio

2659371 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2659372 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2659373 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2659374 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2659375 i ask sir what is the militia it is the whole people
2659376 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2659377 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2659378 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2659379 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2659380 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2659381 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2659382 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2659383 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2659384 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2659385 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2659386 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2659387 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2659388 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2659389 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2659390 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2659391 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2659392 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2659393 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2659394 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2659395 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2659396 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2659397 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2659398 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here
2659399 were grown and the mayors trying to give us a curfew
2659400 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2659401 ch vez no se ir por procedimientos establecidos sino por presiones sociales
2659402 nosotros los due os del pa s cumplimos la ley
2659403 no es que nosotros queramos imponer nuestra particular visi n es que la ley est vigente y ha sido producto de amplios consensos
2659404 i will not hurt or kill you if you give me what i want
2659405 call for a cop call for an ambulance and call for a pizza see who shows up first
2659406 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2659407 success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which one has overcome while trying to succeed
2659408 not anymore though its the same thing with ron people hear stuff about ron and think im not going near ron people hear about queensbridge and say im not going out there but when you get out there like i said about ron when you actually get to know him its different its a great place same with him hes a great person theyre going to love him in houston
2659409 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture
2659410 i lived in a ghetto but am i ghetto is ron ghetto he was born and raised in the projects but he never got involved with all the negative stuff
2659411 it was not far from him but the way he was raised the house was one thing and what happened in the streets was another thing there were guns some bullets came into the house twice i found the bullet holes
2659412 he never was in trouble in queensbridge the neighborhood is rough people did what they did that doesnt mean you have to get caught up with it i dont drink i dont smoke it was never a temptation for me the type of person ron is the way he grew up i dont think the stuff outside affected him
2659413 as long as it wasnt raining so hard you couldnt see ron and his father would be at queensbridge shooting hoops it could be snowing his father would shovel and his little brother would be rebounding feeding him the ball
2659414 people dont know how hard ron worked to get where he is right now
2659415 they think he is this loose cannon guy goes to the beat of his own drum and doesnt pay attention to the rules youve heard all these things its really not true ron where he came from to get to the nba is a dramatic story
2659416 ron was on his own a lot he was a soldier he could have quit many times but he had it in his heart he knew basketball was going to be his out
2659417 the image that he has to me hes not like that at all
2659418 he brought most of the baggage on himself but he has a pure heart hes not a bad guy
2659419 i was into basketball i was in vietnam i was very against drugs in the community thats how this started i fought the drug dealers i go to mass every day i tried to pull ron closer to god and he was ron will give you the shirt off his back hes a great human being i kept ron going to church every day i believed if he gets closer to god i dont have to worry about him
2659420 now hes married hes a great father always doing something with his children always giving back to his community
2659421 it drives him he is proud not of getting out of queensbridge but of being from there his body might have left but his mind and his heart are still there
2659422 top secret finance plans for birmingham an old steel city turned medical hub thats trying to cope with population losses and a bad reputation for crime
2659423 my job is to sell the city he said recently
2659424 if it takes flair to do it ill do it
2659425 hes totally different than any other mayor of birmingham ive ever seen said william stewart a retired political scientist at the university of alabama
2659426 most of the previous mayors have been conservative in their style like business people trying to govern a coporate entity his erratic style just doesnt fit
2659427 ive got goose bumps and its hot out so thats probably not a good sign
2659428 maybe just a little bit too far for an initial attack
2659429 i really thought we were going to come back but there were too many teammates of teammates up there so there was a lot of cat and mouse and it was a bit of a lottery on the way down the hill
2659430 the longer it was and the more attrition it was the better i never really got any better but i never got any worse throughout the race i felt good and i did the best i could
2659431 but its never this long its not necessarily that hot out but its just so humid going up the hill you just cant breathe and the sweat just doesnt come off you
2659432 this was one of the worst years ever on my bike as far as conditions go
2659433 ive been frozen way too many times to count starting with the tour of california when i could barely see and i had to go back and somebody put a jacket on me there were too many in snow global warming my ass thats all i was thinking the whole time
2659434 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body
2659435 it was more riding the course before that was amazing everythings so pristine its almost like youre in an amusement park ride its not real but its an amazing place and its probably the most epic place ive ever raced my bike
2659436 thats for sure but im definitely going to be thinking about the tour all next year
2659437 these services will protect them should they receive physical and emotional harm from their employers

2659448 ah it is no surprise that you weep for narcissus
2659449 for though we always pursued him in the forest you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand
2659450 after all it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself
2659451 i weep for narcissus but i never noticed that narcissus was beautiful i weep because each time he knelt beside my banks i could see in the depths of his eyes my own beauty reflected

2659456 syria did not work on setting up a nuclear reactor with the korean democratic republic or any other country
2659457 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2659458 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2659459 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2659460 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2659461 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2659462 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2659463 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2659464 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2659479 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2659480 cest une tr s bonne course dans les premiers 50 m tres je suis parti dans les conditions de nage que je souhaitais cest dire relativement tranquillement pour conserver de la force je ne me suis pas affol et cela ma permis de finir fort lobjectif c tait d tre patient et je lai fait la finale sera difficile car il y aura des costauds notamment le norv gien oen vainqueur de sa s rie devant le fran ais qui est super fort pour la finale je vais devoir partir plus vite si je veux les titiller et surtout si je veux monter sur le podium le record du monde est en constante volution jesp re prendre part la bagarre
2659481 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2659482 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2659483 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2659484 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2659485 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2659486 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2659487 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2659488 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2659489 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2659490 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2659491 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2659492 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2659493 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2659527 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2659528 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2659529 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2659530 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2659531 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2659534 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2659578 then hell have an inning or two where hell have a little bit of a setback

2659602 fannie and freddies decision to curtail support of the mortgage market is going to make mortgages more expensive for potential home buyers which is going to hurt the overall economy
2659603 theyre the only real buyers in this market and theyre going to buy less thats really bad news
2659604 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2659605 the crisis that we all observe as we drive home everyday continues to strain our results and capital and were still in that dark tunnel
2659606 the government has done a lot to help these companies but mortgage rates are continuing to rise and the housing market is continuing to decline
2659607 theyve already become part of the problem because the government has to worry about them instead of relying on them to save everyone
2659608 the government wanted its bailout plan to be strong enough to calm the markets but not so strong that theyre forced to use it
2659609 but so far its only been partially effective its stabilized the companies but hasnt done anything to help the costs of new mortgages go down
2659610 as long as people are having conversations that focus on who is in worse shape rather than talking about how healthy everyone is its going to be hard for these companies to do much that really improves the housing marketplace

2659612 backed by his friendly southern drawl the practiced charm of a courtroom warrior and a smile bright enough to blind the cameras eye john edwards never lacked the confidence to take the big risk
2659613 he risked in the courtroom making millions as a trial lawyer by winning cases for underdog clients
2659614 and so why not one more risk why not run again for president this time while carrying on an extramarital affair that could easily sink his campaign and should he win the democratic nomination his partys hopes of winning the oval office
2659615 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2659616 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2659617 in doing so edwards admitted he was seduced by his own success and the lavish attention and praise that came with his meteoric rise from his roots in raleigh as a successful but relatively unknown personal injury attorney
2659618 just two years after his senate victory he was on al gores short list for vice president after losing his own bid for the democratic nomination a few years later he bounced back by winning a spot as john kerrys running mate on the partys ticket running again last year he entered the race as one of the three favorites on the democratic side
2659619 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2659620 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2659621 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2659622 his timely endorsement helped voters forget obamas ugly 41 point loss to clinton in the west virginia primary
2659623 edwards was expected to speak in prime time later this month at the democratic national convention ready to emerge as a candidate for a cabinet post in a possible obama administration thats all gone now
2659624 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2659625 a former edwards campaign staff member professes to be the actual father of hunters baby girl
2659626 in a statement provided to the associated press elizabeth edwards confirmed that her husband had confessed the extramarital affair to her in 2006 but that after a long and painful process she was now standing by him
2659627 after the story broke august 9 edwards released a statement that said in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2659628 edwards declared his presidential candidacy in december 2006 his wife campaigned enthusiastically with him and by herself in the months that followed she announced in march 2007 that her cancer formerly in remission had returned and there apparently was no cure
2659629 edwards dropped out midway through this years primaries after it became apparent he could not keep up with front runners obama and hillary rodham clinton he recently endorsed obama
2659630 speaking to reporters friday in honolulu obama praised edwards as a
2659631 i think they need to work through that process of healing obama said
2659632 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2659633 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2659634 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2659635 life is like photography we take the negatives and develop
2659636 i should eat a sandwich but that is downstairs i have gatorade here ill drink that gatorade could be a sandwich
2659637 i better not find out you went to that show tonite
2659638 youre about to learn secrets that most women will never know about meeting and keeping a great man
2659639 stop here mom i want to get myself a cloud to play with
2659640 i have been telling you that the senate is the firewall that protects our country from irresponsible democrat legislation higher taxes wasteful spending more regulation on small businesses and more liberal activist judges on the supreme court
2659641 barack obamas campaign manager recently told politico that obama will focus his campaign resources in republican states to break our firewall and gain a 60 seat filibuster proof supermajority in the senate
2659642 but winning the white house wont be his only goal deputy campaign manager steve hildebrand told politico in an unusual move obamas campaign will also devote some resources to states its unlikely to win with the goal of influencing specific local contests in places such as texas and wyoming
2659643 obamas goal is to destroy our firewall but we can fight back
2659644 watch out for father time the wrinkle fairy and the gray hair gnome
2659645 or as i like to call them the birthday axis of evil
2659646 almost everything in charlie bartlett is based on successful teen comedy formulas of the 70s 80s and 90s like my bodyguard fast times at ridgemont high footloose the breakfast club and say anything the romance between charlie and susan which even has a cat stevens song for a theme is basically harold and maude with a gorgeous teenage girl instead of feisty septuagenarian ruth gordon like many of john hughes high school movies it presents a fantasy of tolerance and camaraderie about kids from different social circles nerds jocks hoods cheerleaders drama clubbers coming together to fight adult authoritarianism
2659647 on arrival at ocs one of the first orders of business was a haircut in wildflecken all soldiers and officers went to the same barbershops
2659648 not so at fort benning the armys post exchange system ran the barbershops they had one barbershop for white soldiers and another for colored at the main post bus station there were colored and white waiting rooms restrooms and water fountains each with its own neatly printed sign
2659649 but racial discrimination and hatred was not limited to signs
2659650 i nearly decked him but fortunately concluded that he was just another ignorant poor white who couldnt hope to compete with candidates like me on his best day
2659651 harassing minorities was a favorite sport of some of the white instructors they made life quite difficult hoping that minorities would become discouraged and drop out some did
2659652 for me there was little chance of that i knew from experience that i could outperform just about anyone in the class it was possible for an instructor to shave points off my exams or to downgrade me in personal evaluations but not enough to cause me to fail outright though the army system was biased against minorities it was not grossly corrupt it was struggling to decide how much integration was enough for the most part i coped with what was being dished out at ocs without losing my temper
2659653 just a steel town girl on a saturday night looking for the fight of her life
2659654 in the real time world no one sees her at all they all say shes crazy
2659655 locking rhymes to the beat of her heart changing movement into the light she has danced into the danger zone when the dancer becomes the dance
2659656 it can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire on the wire between will and what will be
2659657 shes a maniac maniac on the floor and shes dancing like shes never danced before
2659658 on the ice blue line of insanity is a place most never see its a hard won place of mystery touch it but cant hold it
2659659 you work all your life for that moment in time it can come or pass you by its push shove world but theres always a chance if the hunger stays the night
2659660 theres a cold kinetic heat struggling stretching for the peak never stopping with her head against the wind
2659661 shes a maniac maniac at your love and shes dancing like shes never danced before
2659662 it can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire on the wire between will and what will be
2659663 nuthing is worse than answering a call in d dead of d nite n hearing d person on d other side sobbing unable to speak
2659664 at his trial he made an impassioned defense of his own convictions on the indissolubility of marriage the respect due to the juridical patrimony of christian civilization and the freedom of the church in her relations with the state condemned by the court he was beheaded
2659665 precisely because of the witness which he bore even at the price of his life to the primacy of truth over power saint thomas more is venerated as an imperishable example of moral integrity and even outside the church particularly among those with responsibility for the destinies of peoples he is acknowledged as a source of inspiration for a political system which has as its supreme goal the service of the human person
2659666 theyve taken vows to serve all the people in dioceses not just certain ones
2659667 specifically this court finds that the statute as applied in the instant case does not violate the free exercise or establishment clauses of the first amendment nor does it violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment nor does it violate the takings clause of the fifth amendment
2659668 todays ruling upholding the constitutionality of the division statute in virginia is regrettable and reaches beyond the episcopal church to all hierarchical churches in the commonwealth
2659669 we continue to believe that this division statute is clearly at odds with and uniquely hostile to religious freedom the first amendment and prior u s and virginia supreme court rulings we are unwavering in these beliefs and will explore fully every option available to restore constitutional and legal protections for all churches in virginia
2659670 the one discrete constitutional issue raised in those briefs which the court does not resolve in todays opinion is the assertion by the diocese that the statute violates their rights under the contracts clause
2659671 specifically they assert that applying the statute to the instant dispute impairs their contractual rights by not giving appropriate weight and significance to the contractual relationships between the local congregations and the hierarchical church
2659672 we are deeply saddened by the loss of petty officer 2nd class anthony carbullido who will be remembered as a young brave hero i urge the people of guam to join us as we pray for the family and friends whose lives have been changed by this great loss
2659673 i remember when we had less than 25 percent eligible
2659674 it s a family application so you only have to return one per family
2659675 we do have students and parents who live in a world where the income comes hard
2659676 the lunch is designed to be 1 3 of what a child needs nutritionally during the day
2659677 the students will get a 4 digit personal identification number that they enter into a key pad and it opens their lunch account if they are eligible for reduced lunch it will charge 40 cents from the account
2659678 we re going to implement the systems gradually through the school year
2659679 it will be more of a streamlined system but we re not going to eliminate any staff
2659680 we deliver school supplies to 23 public and parochial schools
2659681 we buy a lot of school supplies to take out
2659682 the kids can have the tools they need to do their work
2659683 that s what this is all about the schools used to provide these but budgets have gotten tighter and they can no longer do that so teachers started buying things for their students we want this program to help them make sure the kids have what they need to learn
2659684 if kids are embarrassed about things at school they won t learn as well that s why we don t have our name on anything we take to the schools we just want them to have what they need to learn any kid can have this we don t discriminate they don t have to be low income there are many many good parents but there are some who don t pay attention to what their children need for school we want to make sure those kids have what they need too
2659685 now we re getting some donations but we still have to buy a lot but we are getting good prices for things we have to buy we don t make a lot of noise about this we do a lot for children this is just one thing
2659686 we rely on a lot of help for sorting everything
2659687 we get help from church youth groups and students from midland lutheran college we get help each year from teens who come from camp fontanelle we need a lot of help with this
2659688 the biggest challenge we have is getting all of the supplies
2659689 the store had ordered 1 000 cases of notebooks but they got in only 180 that becomes a problem for everyone trying to get notebooks there are 24 notebooks in a case we can usually get along pretty good with prices now finding enough volume is the problem
2659690 that s not ideal but we do what we need to do
2659691 it s time consuming but it s a satisfying part of what we do we know that these kids are getting what they need we know that this is making a difference
2659692 the mcgruff house program is a partnership between the citiwide pta and the fremont police department to establish safe homes for a child to use primarily on their way to and from school
2659693 at the beginning of the school year the pta sends flyers home to encourage more mcgruff houses
2659694 people have to generally be available before and after school
2659695 they re just required to summon help if needed they do not have to provide rides or anything like that
2659696 you don t have to have school age children to participate
2659697 i think the fees that we charge are reasonable if you compare them to other school districts
2659698 we certainly don t try to make any money off student fees the fees go to support our student programs the participation fees are spread out across various activities
2659699 we do have students and parents who live in a world where the income comes hard
2659700 we deliver school supplies to 23 public and parochial schools
2659701 we buy a lot of school supplies to take out
2659702 the kids can have the tools they need to do their work

2659706 the press we ran at tennessee the 1 2 1 1 we run that here too
2659707 candace is used to being on the top of that and catch is used to being in the interceptor role our man to man full court pressure is also very similar
2659708 in the first quarter when there was that lull candace was huge in shadowing the ball getting steals and helping us pick up the tempo catch was the same way
2659709 sometimes in games you have to ease your way it but 13 2 is not easing your way in
2659710 its a good feeling we know we can call time out and regain our poise

2659761 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2659762 they spread it out between paychecks you have to anymore with the price of gas
2659763 not everybody goes but if they want to play and have a shot at being a starter most of them go
2659764 they re leaders within the school they re held up to a high set of standards because they do represent the school
2659765 we re so fortunate because we have such a great group of kids they re very very responsible and talented
2659766 i think the fees that we charge are reasonable if you compare them to other school districts
2659767 we certainly don t try to make any money off student fees the fees go to support our student programs the participation fees are spread out across various activities
2659768 but it s no more expensive at our high school than any other
2659769 i ve heard of parents paying over 100 just for one sport

2659776 ive got a john abraham shirt a curtis martin shirt and a wayne chrebet shirt
2659777 i guess ill just leave them hanging in my closet
2659778 i thought that is a process i need to get involved in
2659779 to his credit edwards sat back and said what do we need to do i said at a minimum we need to make sure we get the governor the attorney general our senators and congressman involved if that doesn t happen then i think we re chasing a tail we re not going to catch
2659780 i want to talk to bob warner and i want to find out what assistance he can give us
2659781 right now the group is very small because we wanted to make sure we could get the right people involved if we didn t get the right people involved we d be wasting our time now that we have involvement and support now we can expand that group which we intended to so
2659782 it s not a bad idea it wouldn t hurt
2659783 we recognize that but that s not what people want to hear
2659784 frustrated people don t want to hear that it s the federal government s place to deal with this
2659785 we want to enforce the laws that are on the books today and we also want to look to establishing criteria ordinances laws
2659786 we want to get those facts determined and out to the public as they relate to the issue in fremont neb
2659787 we already know what we can t do everyone is real good at telling you what you can t do
2659788 we want to determine what we can do by determining what the problem is then we can determine what steps we can take as a city that make sense and can have an impact to move forward
2659789 we don t know and until we know that you can t commit resources to fight a problem that you haven t even defined
2659790 we need to have some action and we need to have some action quickly
2659791 my goal is to have a list of recommendations submitted to the city council that they can consider and work with local and county officials to try to implement some of the suggestions that we come up with
2659792 we do not intend for this process to string out for months and months and months
2659793 he s a harvard graduate with a great many resources available to him
2659794 he cares deeply about this community he has an unwavering desire to help the problem of illegal immigrants in fremont he seeks a resolution as soon as possible
2659795 bob warner didn t bring something bad to the table he brought something necessary to the table
2659796 it s now being discussed it could have been killed that s not what we re doing we re doing what the mayor promised and that is that we re going to do exactly what we can do on a local level to respond to citizens on both sides
2659797 immigration being a federal issue with little that can take place on the state and local level
2659798 sure why not we just came out to help a friend of ours
2659799 you people and the guy you are supporting doesnt understand fremont politics very well because fremonters greatly object to out of town people stick their noses in fremont politics

2659852 we have been praying for the lambeth conference and now that it has ended we look forward to talking with those who were there it seems it has fulfilled the desires of the archbishop of canterbury and we also look forward to hearing from him
2659853 our absence focused minds on the problems within the communion and spoke louder than our presence would have however the issues which have caused such division are still before us and require decisive action so that the mission of the church will not be further impaired
2659854 in fear and trembling expecting either a distasteful encounter between those of vastly different opinions or the cold shoulder from those who disagree the overwhelming reality has been just the opposite
2659855 we have prayed cried learned and laughed together and discovered something deeper about the body of christ we know more of the deeply faithful ministry of those in vastly differing contexts and we have heard repeatedly of the life and death matters confronting vast swaths of the communion
2659856 suffering the birth pangs of something new which none of us can yet fully appreciate or understand
2659857 urge the official endorsement of the proposed anglican covenant by acc 14 in may 2009
2659858 we deeply regret that during the conference proceedings substantial theological voices outside of the western world have not been present in the evening plenary sessions we are con cerned with the continuing patron is ing attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide we regret attempts to cause divi sions and break the bonds between churches in the global south
2659859 rigidity and a lack of wisdom the primary mindset of the windsor group is conformity or expulsion as yet they display no capacity for creating space only for taking it away
2659860 searching prayerful conversations over a two week period of over 600 anglican bishops the points of substantial agreement are thus worth our attention at the same time the document is not legislation we will pay close attention to it but we must not reify the agreement points in it into laws
2659861 no very clear outcome from it other than to call for the sorts of things that have been called for in the past
2659862 but i think the archbishop has done enough to hold it together but to move things on
2659863 at canterbury the anglican church allowed itself to risk being changed through the liquid of conversation and challenge across cultures and beliefs
2659864 its not at all certain that minds were altered but positions might have been softened and if so theres a chance that something beautiful might emerge in the future the anglican communion might yet fly anew better fit for purpose
2659865 la lluna samaga rere una taronja i fa suc damor delectant se en tu la pluja mentre cau busca un roser i a cada p tal escriu el teu nom ja ho veus res magrada m s que escriure versos i lletres

2659869 securities and exchange board of india sebi will come next week to inspect our system and we hope to launch the future contracts in currency by end of august or early september
2659870 currency futures segment will have a separate settlement from stock futures and cash segment as well as a fresh set of members to participate in the currency futures market
2659871 its ridiculous we dont mind the board but they cant threaten us who are they to tell us what weve to do
2659872 we have a marathi signboard and now they want it to be bigger with larger font size but our patrons are mostly foreigners
2659873 this is because international airlines are trying to gain a foothold in the india bound market before domestic private carriers jet airways india ltd and kingfisher airlines ltd become a threat
2659874 we have managed to control rising fuel prices through correctly hedging fuel india is an important market
2659875 i used to get people who would religiously swear by the baked soya chaklis sev and nachni chips that they would buy from the local grocer however the products had too long of a shelf life and tasted too good to be baked
2659876 the problem is that when you tell people that something is low fat they will finish an entire bag of chaklis as opposed to the two regular chaklis they would have eaten otherwise there is absolutely no regulation when it comes to such food products and therefore the consumer is deluded into thinking that hes actually doing his body some good by consuming such products
2659877 the calorie value of the nachni chips as mentioned on the pack was completely different when we tallied it with the fat content most products came with no labels and even no expiry date
2659878 there are such a large number of housewives and small entrepreneurs that produce these goods that it becomes difficult to regulate the same
2659879 we never said that we wouldnt deal with food products but there needs to be commitment from the side of the manufacture to adhere to a certain model we can only take it forward from there
2659880 the centre still has to design a framework and ratify the act for the entire nation until then we are aware of the guidelines but are unable to implement the same
2659881 i buy two to three packs of these baked goods every week and even serve them with a salsa dip during parties i have at home its definitely upsetting to think that during all this while when i was convinced that i was cutting on calories it was quite the opposite
2659882 more people may be involved in the racket and there may be more victims we are also investigating if they were selling these cds in the market
2659883 we are looking at some options at the moment three or four different options about the strike department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2659884 since winning a second straight olympic title in athens the perennial powerhouse has been in a state of upheaval there was squabbling within the program longtime coach octavian belu left and romania failed to medal at the 2006 world championships for the first time since way back in 1981
2659885 im satisfied because we didnt make so many big mistakes
2659886 well actually acatrinei did her foot slipping off the 4 inch 10 centimeter wide balance beam as she tried to land a backflip
2659887 romania seemed to lack its usual sparkle its shortcomings all the more glaring because it was in the same subdivision as china expected to battle the united states for the gold medal
2659888 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2659889 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2659890 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga
2659891 we are waiting for the official confirmation and only then can we comment
2659892 in last years performance we scored 11 goals in the first game and then we had no goals against
2659893 it was historical and unique and definitely its something that will be very difficult to repeat
2659894 nadine is one of the most important players in our team
2659895 she had proved herself last year she knows how to control the ball and she knows how to work in the box she is self motivated and she knows how to encourage the other players
2659896 actually i dont care if i allow goals or not
2659897 germany will play north korea on tuesday in tianjin needing a victory or draw to secure a quarterfinal berth it is second in group f with four points
2659898 it will keep us going in the tournament and give us a chance to win the gold medal
2659899 descent with modification the change in allele frequency over time just kidding evolution is the theory which explains the origin and diversity of all species on earth maybe other places too it explains how genetic information is inherited through generations and what factors are responsible for genetic changes at its core though not singularly the mechanism of natural selection which is driven by environmental pressures such as competition favors individuals of a species which are able to survive long enough to reproduce that reproduction passes along genes however alike or different from the parent suitable for survival in the current environment all members of a species which are genetically different in any degree from the previous generation are describes having evolved evolution describes this process and is useful for determining ancestry among all living things
2659900 i accept evolutionary theory because of the evidence i have reviewed it has been adequately supported i am convinced even though my knowledge on the subject is little examples like the inability of apes and humans to synthesize vitamin c due to genes which are mutated disabled in the same way has helped me understand just what kind of evidence really exists on the subject im no expert obviously
2659901 i believe that life and humans evolved through natural forces without guidance by god
2659902 one of the most complete examples of a late 19th century courthouse square in texas
2659903 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2659904 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2659905 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2659906 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2659907 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
2659908 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views
2659909 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it obviously because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there
2659910 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2659911 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2659912 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2659913 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2659914 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2659915 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2659916 once john mccain began catering to his new friends in big oil the spigot clearly opened
2659917 undercuts his accusation that mccain is in the industrys pocket
2659918 to tax one industry to subsidize consumption doesnt do anything to encourage supply
2659919 the economy is weak everywhere but in an oil economy
2659920 i am frequently asked to help and have been honored to do so and so i think the same has been true for both rich and dan both of them have been generous not only to political causes but to philanthropic causes
2659921 this pine shaded mansion filled dreamscape of folly and ambition is both the geographic and mythical heart of houston
2659922 long an enclave of houstons wealthiest residents river oaks as opposed to say philadelphias main line or manhattans upper east side tends to be more welcoming less obsessed with pedigree and more open to grand gestures and exhibition
2659923 present that draw for people who otherwise might not visit those homes to see a palatial residence they might not otherwise have an invitation to visit
2659924 you could not have a function like that in west university place with 200 cars
2659925 these are folks who are usually proud of their homes and are willing to open them
2659926 some of these homeowners built their homes because they entertain frequently
2659927 some of the homes have already been vetted meaning the president knows it and the secret service knows it and so it is easy to get approved
2659928 its one of those things where everyone in the neighborhood understands the process
2659929 and its probably the most important presidential election in god how many years
2659930 may not wear a hat or remain by the clerks desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots
2659931 if he cant solve a problem one way he stays on it like a bulldog until he finds another way
2659932 he knows how to craft an issue and deliver the message
2659933 culberson has generated a story line that distinguishes him from the crowd
2659934 i am operating in a twilight zone because there are no rules
2659935 i need to be careful about how i do this
2659936 i am not a candidate i am not interested in doing that
2659937 elections in florida tend to be close and hed have some effect
2659938 though i suspect in the end the conservatives would vote for mccain
2659939 im sure that having a couple weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2659940 mccains people have said theyre not looking for a fight theyre not looking to change the platform
2659941 of course its during the day so well have to go to his shop if only tohru and kyo hadnt taken the kids away we could buy them ice cream again ahh such a peaceful scene us surrounded by little happy children
2659942 the block of granite which was an obstacle in the path of the weak becomes a stepping stone in the path of the strong
2659943 congratulations the images and the words are compelling migraineurs will relate to the visual images and poems those who dont suffer may be better able to empathize after reading the book
2659944 projects such as migraine expressions are rare priceless and sorely needed they offer an intimate view of the impact of migraine disease the works of art in this book are deeply personal and revealing they are heart wrenching and inspiring filled with both terror and hope

2659973 my object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one ive toyed with quitting and just taking a year or two off to travel the world and explore its something ive always wanted to do and can afford to do financially but the practical side of me says its a foolish thing to consider you dont have to quit your job and explore the whole world at once plan two week vacations and select a small part of the world you want to see tuscany and florence london and outskirts paris and amsterdam etc put your practical and systematic qualities to good use planning your experiences if you could get away for a few days every 6 months youd have something to look forward to and something to talk about plus youd be absorbing new information about the world and about yourself does your alma mater have an alumni travel program that would be a way to meet people and learn new things you might have a botanist guiding you through the amazon or an art history prof leading you through the louvre good stuff you do get vacation leave dont you i just got a big raise and my feeling is complete and utter ambivalence i didnt ask for it or lobby for it i just got it and shrugged my shoulders i guess its nice but i dont really need the extra money i already make plenty well you must be bringing value to the company or they wouldnt have given you an unsolicited big raise companies cant run without good accountants sounds like you under estimate your own value and the value of the accounting profession if you no longer like the activity of accounting see a career counselor if you like accounting but dont like your work environment figure out what you dont like and seek to change those aspects or move on i can think of plenty of things to do with your money aside from travel my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one and the work is play for mortal stakes is the deed ever really done for heaven and the futures sakes
