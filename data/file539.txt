5390001 these poems will break your heart and then mend what was broken with a beauty that is sad and bitter and tender what we need in these times of dislocation and loss
5390002 in this fierce and melancholy tale of one womans displacement and exile we discover the heartbreakingly contemporary narrative of all refugees building anew grafting fresh languages and tastes onto shattered separations and sorrow learning again to love bringing us this vanished poetry of christina peri rossi and making it her own is translator marilyn buck herself an internal exile bound by prison walls but whose spirit lifts us free

5390006 for example in linux the variables for a system call are passed directly using the register file in os x they are packed up in a memory buffer passed to a variety of places and the results are then passed back using another memory buffer before the results are written back to the register file
5390007 in the past why could we have apps that needed a 10th of the memory that most apps are demanding now
5390008 ah so i was right by any chance have you attempted to quantify that windows comparisons would also be nice

5390010 afa asked mcdonalds to remove the mcdonalds name and logo from the nglcc web site where it is listed as a corporate partner and organization ally of nglcc afa also asked the burger fries giant to remove the endorsement of nglcc by richard ellis vice president of communications mcdonalds usa from the nglcc web site mcdonalds refused both requests
5390011 thrilled to join the national gay amp lesbian chamber of commerce and ready to go to work i share the nglccs passion for business growth and development within the lgbt community and i look forward to playing a role in moving these important initiatives forward
5390012 this boycott is not about hiring homosexuals or homosexuals eating at mcdonalds or how homosexual employees are treated it is about mcdonalds as a corporation choosing to put the full weight of their corporation behind promoting the homosexual agenda including homosexual marriage
5390013 your dollars for happy meals and big macs could end up paying for sex change operations of mcdonalds employees if the home of the golden arches continues its promotion of homosexuality
5390014 if mcdonalds restaurants and franchises follow the small business advice of the companys new homosexual partner the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce nglcc which received a 20 000 grant from mcdonalds there would be chaos
5390015 permit the transsexual cross dressing transitioning employee to use restrooms that correspond to his or her full time gender presentation regardless of where the individual is in the transitioning process
5390016 in other words if a transgender man or say employee at a mcdonalds believes his supposed gender is really a woman so he wears a dress and high heels he should be able to use the female restroom that surely would do wonders for the productivity and workplace environment of female employees and customers at a small business including all those local mcdonalds franchises
5390017 eliminates right of same sex couples to marry initiative constitutional amendment
5390018 everyones choice of partner my catholic faith and longtime affiliation with the catholic church leads me to believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman
5390019 our main beef with manchester is the exhaustive amount of money he contributed with glee to take away this brand new right and to write discrimination into the california constitution for the very first time
5390020 estimated that a full throated television campaign for one week this fall in california would cost 5 million
5390021 there will not be any gay bashing in our campaign
5390022 if other supporters try it we will do everything we can to stop it
5390023 if we lose california if they defeat the marriage amendment im afraid that the culture war is over and christians have lost ive never said that publicly until now but thats just the reality of the fact

5390025 traditional marriage is in grave peril across the nation due to outrageous decisions by activist judges and radical legislators in massachusetts california vermont connecticut new jersey new hampshire and oregon
5390026 if we dont act now counterfeit marriage will spread across america marriage amendments will be nullified pastors and churches will be silenced from speaking publicly against homosexuality your children will learn in school that homosexual behavior is normal and healthy

5390028 starting out behind is usually an ominous sign for a proposition
5390029 over 90 percent of propositions that start out behind get taken down
5390030 the field poll has consistently understated the support of californians who believe the definition of marriage should be upheld
5390031 during proposition 22 the field poll reported that support for that initiative was approximately 50 in the months leading up to the election while the measure received more than 61 of votes at the ballot box
5390032 in may when field was reporting that support for the initiative was at 40 the los angeles times survey found support at 54 over the years field has consistently understated support for the initiative by a minimum of 10 percent the current findings continue to substantially understate the true support for the initiative

5390067 sad and funny full of pathos and the lost dreams of youth youll be okay will find its way to the short list of exceptional books by women of the beat generation that includes carolyn cassadys off the road and joyce johnsons minor characters this year on the 50th anniversary of the publication of on the road readers may well want to turn to edies long overdue memoir for one womans soulful view of kerouac carr ginsberg and burroughs whom she knew intimately and describes in her own inimitable style
5390068 you have a unique viewpoint from which to write about jack as no one else has or could write i feel very deeply that this book must be written and no one else i repeat can write it
5390069 kerouacs first wife edie parker played a pivotal role in his literary evolution but her side of the story hasnt been fully known until now
5390070 a quirky and poignant addition to the beat lore and memory by a woman who lived it
5390071 this is a wonderful memoir of a girl in love when she wrote it edie frankie parker was no longer a girl and her love jack kerouac was long gone but edie or frankie as her intimates called her remembered everything about her brief marriage to jack as if a bubble of resilient sunshine had encapsulated those few years during world war 2 and kept intact every detail she remembers what they ate what they wore what movies they saw her jack kerouac was young handsome a lover of fun and a would be writer he stayed so in her memory and though she alludes occasionally to the alcoholic monster that emerged in later years that creature doesnt live here in these pages we meet the young genius of just before on the road adored by all and loved by her most of all the flavor of the war years with all their privations and mad hopes wafts from these pages freshly like an atlantic breeze and makes one wonder finally what might have happened if jack had settled down with frankie instead of following the turbulent destiny that changed america
5390072 edie long delayed post humous memoir clears up much of the myth making and made up facts about this tumultuous but seminal relationship between herself and ex husband jack kerouac she was there at the first meeting between the beats she knew jack kerouac as an ambitious reckless driven writer searching to make a name for himself in the big city honest poignant humorous this book is a must read about a much neglected saga of the legendary iconic kerouac
5390073 zero tolerance is not about words or protecting teachers some of the time
5390074 it is about making offenders pay and protecting teachers all of the time
5390075 its no good blaming schools for deteriorating behaviour among young people when parents all too often set such an appalling example themselves
5390076 it is wholly wrong and completely unacceptable that some misbehaving pupils receive encouragement rather than condemnation from their parents
5390077 the next time any of us come across foul mouthed feckless potentially violent youths lets lay the blame where it belongs not with the schools not with the teachers but with the parents
5390078 if an incident of harassment verbal or physical abuse warrants prosecution in any other public place it should warrant prosecution if it occurs in a school

5390131 lions are extremely socially conservative and see the mixing o
5390132 too often the spirit of urban community is undermined by crime and vandalism by poverty and pollution
5390133 liberal democrats want more police on the streets more quality affordable housing fairer local taxation more sustainable green living and want local people to have the power to determine their own priorities for their own communities
5390134 i wholly oppose id cards im in support of local income tax as opposed to council tax
5390135 in general the issues the liberal democrats stand for are ones i am wholly in support of
5390136 im moving for very positive reasons the things the liberal democrats believe in that i also believe in that the labour party believed in when i joined that is no longer the case
5390137 who could have thought that a labour government would become a lapdog to george bushs right wing republican administration
5390138 when labour cannot even retain the support of their own candidates it is surely a sign of things to come

5390158 preventing the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments is zoning the solution
5390159 if communities take time now to look at their zoning regulations you can really lessen the impact dramatically so an adult entertainment business doesnt pop up next to a high school church or day care center
5390160 i recognize the courts have upheld the constitutional rights of people to buy and sell these materials the courts have also said governments have the right to regulate where such materials are sold
5390161 all are deeply destructive images that erode male respect for women
5390162 spousal use of pornography and its clinical significance for asian american women
5390163 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5390164 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women
5390165 the pursuit of everlasting novelty is the enemy of actual relationship
5390166 in californias unregulated porn film industry an alarming number of performers are infected with hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases and nobody seems to care
5390167 there is a constant demand for new talent and few actresses last more than a year or two checks sometimes bounce the borderline legal status of the industry makes performers reluctant to seek redress in court
5390168 it is high time to expose and challenge the liberal consensus

5390172 all the lovey dovey stuff that theres not a big market for
5390173 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
5390174 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
5390175 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
5390176 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer
5390177 the look in her eyes tells us that she would like this bondage session to be over pretty soon forget it girl
5390178 i was told before the video and they said this very proudly mind you that in this line most of the girls start crying because theyre hurting so bad i couldnt breathe i was being hit and choked i was really upset and they didnt stop they kept filming you can hear me say turn the f ing camera off and they kept going
5390179 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5390180 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5390181 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job
5390182 three of the most common mental health problems of girls and women eating disorders low self esteem and depression
5390183 business locations with adult oriented businesses had a significant loss of sales tax collections 42 as compared to control areas
5390184 weve been hearing the community say get rid of it
5390185 this city is right on the edge of a growth spurt cities have windows of opportunity and this is it weve got a problem in that the adult entertainment business acts as a kind of anti gravity force
5390186 years of frustration and community heartache for many local residents
5390187 there is a constant demand for new talent and few actresses last more than a year or two
5390188 people do not as a rule buy pornography in their own neighborhoods
5390189 if we allow local bars to stay open one hour later soon well let them stay open all night
5390190 if we reject this property tax override the city will suffer a continuing erosion of its tax base and go bankrupt
5390191 how about location can they open a porn shop right next to the bridge school how about renting rooms in the high school i think that there is a limit as to location and i think that a dense residential neighborhood is not appropriate
5390192 were furious said summer street resident mike kirby a former city councilor who with his wife lu stone have lived in their home for 25 years

5390195 an effective and rapid consciousness raiser about misogyny and male views of women
5390196 it is the opinion of the fbi that not much can be achieved with this and we told government so in a diplomatic note
5390197 the chinese earthquake victims are also human beings they suffer the same pain so as soon as we heard that and also saw pictures in dharamsala we really felt very very sad
5390198 and we are going to organise a prayer meeting i think today or tomorrow in dharamsala

5390209 has pushed this war in iraq from the beginning they are so well organized and their members are extraordinarily powerful most of them are quite wealthy they have been able to exert power
5390210 he stands by his message namely that for the last few years aipac has not represented mainstream american jewish opinion and that the organizations middle east policies while in direct alignment with the bush administration have been counterproductive to israels long term security
5390211 anyone attempting to mischaracterize his words as targeting the broader jewish community rather than aipacs leadership is being purposely misleading
5390212 for mr moran to again suggest that jews are responsible for the war in iraq and that they somehow strangle american foreign policy is as senseless as it is bigoted
5390213 while there is nothing wrong with criticizing aipac or for that matter any organization with which you disagree spreading false statements is clearly irresponsible
5390214 if it were not for the strong support of the jewish community for this war with iraq we would not be doing this the leaders of the jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going and i think they should

5390241 the crew raced at the national championships of great britain last weekend and won the silver medal they were narrowly beaten by leander club
5390242 the crew will represent england in the under 23s fours event in the home countries international match in cardiff this saturday they will also form the basis of the eight man boat when they combine with members of leander club to race against scotland ireland and wales
5390243 this is a just reward for what has been a long and in many ways tough season it is also encouraging that only one member of the current team mike ewing graduates this year so the remaining crew will return to the uwe boat club squad next season
5390244 the commitment that has been shown by the crew in training and competition this year has paid off with this fantastic news the crew have worked extremely hard and have been pushed all the way by fred and the strength and conditioning team that we have at the university i wish the crew all the best for the weekend and i am sure they will further impress the england selectors with their performance

5390255 many states including western states such as the uk are currently embroiled in conflicts around the world conflicts are no longer the classic one army against another but rather they may involve multiple actors such as private firms or children this in turn raises questions regarding accountability and the implementation of the law moreover many states are also helping in the reconstruction of post conflict states but often become unstuck because they are unsure of how to deal with the situation such issues suggest that there is an urgent need to rethink the law its relevance and application and to consider its possible reform

5390262 today we would be taking too much political risk to invest in iran because people will say total will do anything for money

5390266 edward lewis runs seoconsultants com one of the more well known and trusted directories in the seo space
5390267 when i first started learning seo about 5 years back edward sent me an email letting me know that something i wrote was incorrect he was right and i made sure i fixed the issue but he was also quite abrasive
5390268 in less than a week he was banned from the site for being too curt abrasive and disrespectful
5390269 plus many of the people who know what they are talking about eventually exit the conversation
5390270 being correct is not enough to ensure success you also have to package your message in a format that people find appealing which is part of the reason why blogs are so popular someone slicker than you is going to take your ideas and repackage them in a profitable format
5390271 easier for people to buy off on changing their opinions if they learn from a trusted messager especially if they do not have to admit that they are wrong to do so
5390272 i have been banned from forums before for trying to explain that something was either incorrect or misleading
5390273 i know some mods on forums that are gruff and tick me off but i move on
5390274 how in the world do you write such thoughtful incisive material and so concisely how does your brain go from reading about another sphinn pissing match to thinking about having people self select etc
5390275 i kind of wish he was banned earlier but the end result wasnt my call
5390276 i dont know ed well enough to say i know his inner workings intimately but from what ive observed from almost a decade of seeing him interact online im prepared to say
5390277 ill say that edward is 99 9 a genuinely nice guy online thats a better than most me included

5390280 nearly every life lost to malaria could have been saved with access to effective medicines
5390281 my foundation has helped organize markets for hiv aids drugs and i am proud that we have been able to extend this model to malaria todays announcement is an important step forward in global efforts to increase access to affordable and effective malaria treatment and i applaud the commitments of these companies to lower volatility in this market and offer low and sustainable prices that will save more lives
5390282 i come from a family of farmers and know first hand about both agricultural production and pharmaceutical production
5390283 poor planning bad weather and other factors can dramatically influence price and cause volatility we appreciate the clinton foundations holistic approach to reducing that volatility and making lower drug prices sustainable in the long term
5390284 since 2001 novartis has supplied more than 180 million treatments of coartem to malaria endemic countries

5390291 i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here
5390292 we do not believe that todays meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lamas representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighbouring regions
5390293 we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit

5390303 there are lots of reasons you want to read this book among them because there are quite a lot of astonishingly apt and incisive and occasionally uproarious descriptions of the subtleties of everyday life because many of the sentences are also as perfect as english allows because its a wonderfully wry and roundabout guide to gay and literary san francisco because you actually do need to know how a person is like a flower and a flower like a person because it also dowses for and find unexpected pleasures that we particularly need at this moment in time

5390362 what are you going to do about it stay on the job until every
5390363 i can only say that as i when i go home and spend time where my headquarters is in tampa or when i spend time where im from on the west coast its hard to really notice that theres much of a war going on thinking that theres a world war ii level of effort going on in the middle of the middle east central asia and the horn of africa is hard for most people to appreciate i think its important that people understand the dangers of not contesting this area if we let the extremists get embedded if we let the extremists gain ground if we let the extremists have time and resources then i believe theyll eventually insinuate their way into the mainstream they could then gain territory gain time gain weapons of mass destruction and over time theyd move us to the war that were all the big war that were all trying to avoid so i can only tell you that what were doing out here is very very important for our security we were actually fighting these people well before 9 11 and it takes a little bit of time and effort but people need to educate themselves about why were fighting who were fighting and what it means if we back away from them i think our young troops that are out here fighting are doing a wonderful job and an absolutely necessary job and id also like to say just to kind of close up hugh is that i dont believe its necessary to stay out here in this huge force size forever we can over time get our own forces down as long as the moderates in the region are willing to stand up take responsibility and move against these extremists on their own so helping them help themselves is really the key to our success i believe were doing that in a lot of places its a hard fight its a long fight but with patience and perseverence we can do it we certainly have got the courage of our troops to rely upon and they wont let us down
5390364 reveals that a colombian army intelligence battalion linked to montoya secretly created and staffed a clandestine terror unit in 1978 1979
5390365 under the guise of the american anti communist alliance aaa or triple a the group was responsible for a number of bombings kidnappings and assassinations against leftist targets during that period
5390366 killed over the same two year period that montoya led the joint task force south the u s funded unit charged with coordinating counternarcotics and counterguerrilla operations in that region from 1999 2001
5390367 declassified documents also detail state department concern that one of the units under montoyas command at the task force the 24th brigade had ties with paramilitaries based in the town of la hormiga the location of the gravesite
5390368 jointly planned and conducted a military operation in 2002 to eliminate marxist guerrillas from poor areas around medellin a city in northwestern colombia that has been a centre of the drug trade
5390369 we will continue and what we are doing in the 13th district is a message to the violent telling them desist we will go everywhere in the country because urban guerrilla warfare has no place in colombia
5390370 believe in colombia in this government the respect shown for human rights in this operation is no accident
5390371 its not likely to succeed the iranians want a new caliphate based in teheran the saudis want a new caliphate based in mecca arabs dont trust persians sunni dont trust shia and so on no one will trust hizb al tahrir with the leadership of the muslim world and while some may humor the newcomers as a way to tweak the israelis none of them will take direction from upstarts among a people that they scorn except for their value in rabble rousing in their own nations
5390372 the iranian nation is about to take its final step in the nuclear issue
5390373 i hope that by the end of the year we will be able to hold celebrations about the iranian nations right to nuclear technology
5390374 this path that iran has chosen is irreversible and big powers should not make useless efforts to prevent the iranian nation from moving forward
5390375 hizbullah destroyed at least half of israel in the lebanon war now only half the path to its destruction remains
5390376 it was proven that by means of an offensive operation that need not be equal to israels moves it is possible to neutralize the zionist navy
5390377 there is a link between irans nuclear weapons program on one hand and its ideology of trying to facilitate a cataclysmic event to hasten the return of the mahdi as a result no conceivable positive or negative incentives will influence the leadership of the clerics and the revolutionary guards from acquiring nuclear weapons they need nuclear weapons in order to facilitate the ideological precepts of the return of the mahdi
5390378 the process of diplomacy as far as ahmadinejad and khamenei are concerned is to prevent sanctions that would constrain the nuclear weapons progress and to that extent iran has done well to drag out this process
5390379 these nuclear weapons are tied to the return of the mahdi and no one says this
5390380 just as it is in the nature of the scorpion to sting so it is in the nature of the ayatollahs ruling iran to establish an islamic empire and destroy israel
5390381 toward these ends the regime pursues nuclear weapons subverts iraq and supplies money and arms to islamist terrorist groups like hizbullah hamas and palestinian islamic jihad the deliberate initiation of war with israel in july 2006 by hizbullah most probably at the direction of the iranian regime confirmed the worst fears about ahmadinejad a nuclear armed iran the single greatest security threat to the international community in general and to the united states and israel in particular

5390620 when you see mobi at the end of a service you know its designed to work with a mobile device
5390621 a man draws a circle around himself into which he gathers his wife and children and protects them other men draw larger circles into which they gather together their cousins and other relatives yet there are other men who draw even larger circles from within which they care for and protect their whole village
5390622 i also didnt know about any of the family history let alone about slavery in the north theres no amnesia theres no guilt for me it didnt exist katrina asks what i would think if i were my ancestor simon even though im not guilty how i would deal with the fact that my brother was a slave trader
5390623 do you also trace the trade of other prominent northern families engaged in slave trade such as the browns of rhode island and thomas h perkins of massachusetts and is there a link in their slavery ventures
5390624 how were the slave owners able to reconcile slavery with their so called christian beliefs would this be the epitome of hypocrisy or what
5390625 though your particular ancestors did not directly engage in trading slaves how much of your familys success and your own opportunities do you now attribute to the direct or indirect effects of the trade and how would you most fairly assess a tax on your current family wealth as fair reparation for those unfairly gotten gains
5390626 how if at all learning about your familys slave trading past has affected your sense of family or cultural pride and if it has how have you begun to start working though these emotions
5390627 i have never understood why using actual manpower was considered abhorrent
5390628 given the limitations of innovation during the period of slavery in the us do you believe your ancestors engaged in slave trade primarily for financial expediency just as those who purchased the slaves were doing it for the same purpose
5390629 katrina and i committed ourselves from the beginning to dedicate profits generated from the film and this book to overcoming racism and other forms of systemic inequity that exist in the united states and elsewhere
5390630 i will say then that i am not nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the black and white races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
5390631 mrs rockefeller gave a up a great deal to help the poor and her husband was a great man
5390632 benefits but the prejudice the status known expected for my social class never
5390633 you cant change who you ancestors were but hopefully you can learn from their mistakes its a complex issue and its hard to talk about im interested in learning different perspectives on this issue do you think there are differences in the history experiences and guilt of descendants of slave owners traders from the north and south
5390634 i didnt drop the bomb but i want to help you out
5390635 were there other books before yours which your gleamed your research on the topic and why has this taken so long to be written and shown on tv finally do you think this will be part of the american history class rather then the versions we were taught in school
5390636 i was pleased to see the transformative manner in which your family and many african americans acknowledged the painful past and sought to heal your cousin katrina brownes film brought a new freedom to people of all colors towards a human liberation do you think this liberation can impact a juster transfer of power and wealth so that renewed trust can lead to more effective shared outcomes across racial and geographical barriers
5390637 what has been your reception from contacts with various churches
5390638 i am curious can you identify something like a characteristic or belief within you or your family members that prompted you to go on this trip and to explore these issues of race i got the sense that some of your family members chose not to come is there something that you all had in common or did you all have different reasons for embarking on the journey the rationale for the question is there something extraordinary about you and your family or was it just a willingness to take the leap into these issues is it your elite family background highlighted in the film that compelled you all to get involved i think it is a powerful poignant journey that youre on just because the film has aired doesnt mean your journeys are over but i wonder what about others will others embark on similar journeys or is your family unique
5390639 did you have the same set of reasons goals priorities and motivations for joining this
5390640 the world has changed considerably since the time of your journey
5390641 has any effort been made to connect with african american descendants of any of the slaves from the dewolfe
5390642 what an orgy of shame i endured traces of the trade and discovered nothing new in it except for perhaps the disgusting depths that self hating bleeding heart white liberals will descend to and self righteously insist on dragging everybody else along with them
5390643 reparations are not the solution especially if we subtract what blacks have cost america
5390644 do you deal with the issues of special advantages and having the proper family connections in inheriting the trade
5390645 what suggestions would you have for us to make this more than educational how do we best get folks to probe their own feelings about race power responsibility privilege etc id greatly appreciate your suggestions for specific activities
5390646 father forgive them for they know not what they do
5390647 truthfully now all you people are is a group of self serving hypocritical white liberal americans pandering to a history of self aggrandizement arent you
5390648 keep it up guys you simply give the rest of the world another reason to despise americans
5390649 how do you make permanent changes in your lives that recognize the power of white privilege and the need for white people to change if racial justice is to be realized in the u s
5390650 tom why does your family feel it is our responsibility to make amends for past generations mistakes
5390651 if you or any of your family offered an apology to the black communities of ghana or the u s did the black community accept your apology if so did any of you feel that blacks were relieved to have an apology of any sort or were they able to absorb the apology in your presence
5390652 my question to you is do you have any close black friends and i dont mean black acquaintances colleagues or neighbors
5390653 i was surprised to learn that slaves had not been apprehended at gun point by the slave traders but had actually been bartered and sold by their own leaders that being the case dont the black ancestors bear an almost equal responsibility for this shameful trade is this being discussed
5390654 is he a cousin of some kind of james dewolf and the bristol family and was he also involved in the slave trade
5390655 how do we get you to come to a town hall meeting etc i live in washington state
5390656 as the film points out virtually everyone at the time was complicit in and benefited from slavery does that mean we condemn all our ancestors
5390657 i am white and my family has never owned or benefited by the slave trade in anyway most of my ancestors moved to the united states shortly before the civil war and never had any ties whatsoever to the slave trade and for that matter many of my foreign ancestors fought to abolish slavery for the union in the american civil war the problem we face today is guilt by association attitude just because i am white does not mean that i or millions of others like me have ever had any ancestor who ever owned or benefited from the slave trade
5390658 complicity how the north promoted prolonged and profited from slavery
5390659 i would love to speak to ms browne and other members ofher family in an effort to seek some form of closure
5390660 do you think this will have any effect on changing the way history is taught in the public schools
5390661 if you were to re edit amercian history to add in the truths you discovered about the actual slave trade what would you give as a title to this period of time as a whole second part of this quesiton is what would you title it as it started and as it progressed and as it stands today
5390662 i am confused by your statement that there are far more white people living in poverty than black people
5390663 is it a far stretch to think that it has more to do with gangster rap than the legacy of slavery and discrimination
5390664 why can no black man i ever met name the last slave in his family if they care so deeply concerned about the hardships which they endured
5390665 why do you suspect that your ancestors were trading africans and not germans or greeks
5390666 i am sure that we can agree that the glamorization of drug abuse breaking of the law probably has much to do with the present situation which plagues african americans
5390667 i cant make assumptions about your present financial situation but due to your myopic views i can assume that you were raised in a life with a certain amount of money
5390668 the thing confuses me is your interest in the subject the time youve spent makes it hard for me to believe theres not a hidden agenda
5390669 if there were an all white college there would be protests and shootings and bombings and riots there are black colleges correct
5390670 yes i think thats a real stretch i think you overestimate how many adult blacks listen to that particular music but the real issue is that its an art form which primarily reflects rather than creates the cultural attitudes it portrays
5390671 well partly because their slaving voyages were exclusively to ports on the african coast where few germans or greeks were for sale
5390672 theres a sucker born every minute and i want to shake hands with each of them
5390673 the money wont change me im only a sheet metal workers son from newcastle

5390694 you know how willow is too little to be able to jump up to the counter in the bathroom and you know how elijah tends to fall in to that gigantic water fountain when hes getting a drink
5390695 cmon and look i cant wait to show you what weve done
5390696 see what ive done here is lay down a little bit of carpeting so that we dont have to put our feeties on the cold floor when we come in here to use the drinking fountain secondly ive pulled this bridge down from the wall so that willow can just hop up on it and walk straight over to the sink counter and then voila he can look out the window with the rest of us but what im most excited about and what took us the longest to accomplish is this
5390697 i know you worked really hard on this project but im sorry to say that i can see a few flaws in your finished product
5390698 we knew you were going to say that we had a discussion and we voted and it was decided that since this is where you like to sit wed scoot over and make room for you on the chair in the other room were sure there is enough room for everyone and besides we dont like it when you sit on our water fountain

5390709 all are deeply destructive images that erode male respect for women
5390710 spousal use of pornography and its clinical significance for asian american women
5390711 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5390712 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women
5390713 the pursuit of everlasting novelty is the enemy of actual relationship
5390714 in californias unregulated porn film industry an alarming number of performers are infected with hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases and nobody seems to care

5390721 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
5390722 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
5390723 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
5390724 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer

5390727 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5390728 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5390729 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

5390745 how did the person respond when they were aggressed in 95 of these 3 000 and some acts of aggression the person was either neutral as in no change of facial expression or verbal expression or was sort of saying that feels great keep doing it right on and in only 3 did we see some overt expression of displeasure or pain again it seems to be very important to the people who are watching this to believe that the recipient of aggression is fact enjoying it is choosing it at some level

5390798 the clyde windfarm will represent a very important step in the development of renewable energy in scotland and in meeting shared european targets it is another step towards making scotland the green energy capital of europe
5390799 the scottish government has an ambitious target to generate 31 per cent of scotlands electricity demand from renewable sources by 2011 and 50 per cent by 2020
5390800 todays announcement makes it virtually certain that the 2011 target will be met early and exceeded by the end of this parliamentary term and represents a significant milestone on the way to achieving the 2020 target
5390801 scotland has a clear competitive advantage in developing clean green energy sources such as wind wave and tidal power
5390802 we have put renewable energy at the heart of our vision of increasing sustainable economic growth
5390803 installed renewables capacity is already greater than nuclear capacity but this announcement demonstrates that we are only at the start of the renewables revolution in scotland combined with the crucial announcement of a new biomass plant in fife on friday the clyde declaration today makes this weekend one of the biggest advances ever in energy technology in scotland
5390804 cooler temperatures and conservation slowed the amount of water leaving the basin in november
5390805 while this is good news its important to understand that we are in a rainfall dependent basin we must have rainfall to return the water levels in lakes and the river levels back to normal
5390806 winter and spring rains typically refill the reservoirs in this basin
5390807 without normal rainfall patterns during this period the ability to generate adequate electricity keep shallow water intakes covered and provide water for industrial uses becomes more of a concern
5390808 duke energy remains committed to conserving water as we have since april we will continue to use our fleet of hydro generation assets far less than we typically do use of those assets has been reduced by more than 50 percent

5390825 having to obtain allowances for existing coal plants through an auction is nothing more than a carbon tax
5390826 it should be called what it is a disproportionate tax on consumers in the 25 states that depend on coal
5390827 i am unwavering in my support for mandatory federal action on climate change
5390828 the science is clear that we must move ahead and act quickly but the legislation must not pit one region against another and create regional winners and losers in our nations economy
5390829 duke energy supports an ambitious national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent by 2050
5390830 we are grateful to the senators and the senate committee on environment and public works for moving climate change legislation forward but this bill unduly penalizes consumers in the midwest great plains and southeast who depend on coal for much of their electricity
5390831 customers in coal dependent regions are being asked to pay twice to deal with climate change
5390832 they would immediately pay for allowances to keep electricity flowing on day one of the program then they would pay again to retrofit or replace power plants as new technologies become available this is an unwarranted and counterproductive double hit
5390833 the focus of climate change legislation must be to protect main street consumers rather than to enrich wall street traders who are eager to participate in a carbon auction and who profit from volatile markets
5390834 a more effective approach to reduce our national carbon footprint is to follow the principles in the highly successful 1990 clean air act amendments this legislation allocated allowances based on utilities emissions with the number of allowances declining over time that system provided a transition period to protect consumers and regional economies while cleaner technologies were developed and commercialized
5390835 the clean air act has shown that we can improve our environment and not damage our economy
5390836 lets leverage the principles of that legislation and go to work on climate change

5390906 i believe this paper will change forever the field of human genetics
5390907 this new recognition of the widespread presence of cnvs is likely to help decipher a mutation process that commonly impacts the human genome to produce cancers and other diseases

5390931 the club was called hard hearted hannahs and it was started by my wife gloria and i in city market
5390932 it became the top jazz club in the southeast so much so that a couple of movies were shot there one with wayne shorter playing tenor saxophone
5390933 the advantage of being a jazz musician was that we were able to put together a club with great ambience atmosphere and acoustics
5390934 the staff was musically in tune to creative music being performed when clint eastwood filmed midnight in the garden of good and evil in savannah hannahs hosted a party for him he was mesmerized by the music the ambience and the quality of the club
5390935 one must hope that manmohan singh does not lead the congress and the upa into a disaster by dogmatically insisting on pushing the deal through
5390936 that would rupture the upas present arrangement with the left which is a bulwark against hindu chauvinism and pave the way for the bjp to make a bid for power
5390937 the government lacks a popular mandate to complete the deal
5390938 ironically singh is embarking on this terrible gamble when it is not even clear that the deal can be put through its next complicated steps and completed before george w bush demits office as president
5390939 practically speaking i think if its not done by the time we go to the august recess its awfully hard
5390940 the deal is likely to face major hurdles even before the u s congress deadline approaches
5390941 the greatest of these will be encountered at the nsg many of whose members are certain to ask questions and demand clarifications from the u s and india
5390942 there is a feeling among some nsg members that major concessions have already been made in indias favour because it will be allowed to keep its nuclear weapons it is therefore reasonable to ask that india pledge not to conduct another nuclear test or agree to cease fissile material production four major nuclear states france russia the uk and the u s have already declared that they will not produce nuclear fuel and china is observing a moratorium in practice
5390943 wed like to believe that this deal is one that can and should be supported by whoever comes into office in january of 2009 but obviously the next u s government will have to look at this and make their own decisions

5390970 i am so pleased that the clinton hunter development initiative is working with the governments of malawi rwanda and the uk to improve the lives of children by investing in teacher training facilities we are investing in the futures of malawi and rwanda
5390971 educating young people can significantly improve their chances in life and this government has made it a priority in our effort to reduce poverty in the developing world providing new and highly skilled teachers means more kids can go to school whilst the quality of the education improves for many more that is why this agreement is so important and i hope the partnership approach will be an example for many more projects in the future
5390972 this looks to us to be a great way of delivering precisely what the governments of rwanda and malawi see as their vision for education in their countries alongside dfid that makes for a great partnership model thats worth trying out and if it works taking it to scale its fantastic so many children can benefit from such an initiative
5390973 this is exactly the right kind of partnership and intervention we need in rwandas education sector right now our biggest challenge now is not quantity but quality the training and deployment of additional teachers is a priority to ensure that we provide the right kind of foundation for our children to access secondary and higher education

5390980 none of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged essentially it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want and then they get massively reinforced for it with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones everyone from executives and judges to scientists and politicians may reason to emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in how to interpret the facts

5390986 penuhilah rumpang yg ada dengan sebaik2nya moga lebih aman dan bahagia
5390987 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
5390988 it was getting harder and harder to use the existing proprietary operating systems to quickly and inexpensively come out with new technologies
5390989 any given operating system is designed to cope with a certain amount of complexity
5390990 as more and more features are added in beyond the original voice capabilities it becomes increasingly difficult to do that smoothly without having to do major surgery on the software system
5390991 the idea was that third party writers would create applications that could be guaranteed on all the phones produced for this operating system regardless of which manufacturer had created it
5390992 weve seen in practical terms where the operating system has needed a refinement in real phone projects
5390993 so it is uniquely suited for the needs of the phone market
5390994 were not trying to put everything from a desktop into a phone the most important application thats in a smartphone is the phone were not particularly addressing the combination market of a device that happens to be a computer and a phone
5390995 we think symbian os is very well suited to both enterprise and consumer markets
5390996 we have partnerships with many companies that are well positioned to take advantage of the connections into enterprise data and youll see more and more of this
5390997 if an it department has a choice between buying a custom new pocket pc for their staff to run some dedicated software on or simply rolling out an application using symbian os on phones that their employees already have then theres a strong incentive to use the symbian os solution there
5390998 the consumers who are buying the high end devices are the very tech savvy early adopters who are inevitably mobile professional types
5390999 so that line is not particularly easy to draw in market terms
5391000 i know we say that every year but its true
5391001 symbian offers a number of key advantages prominent among those is power management thats been critical from the heritage of psion days with mobile devices that people carried around with them and expected to last for months
5391002 its still visible in the software systems that we see now with long battery life
5391003 some developers when they use symbian os for the first time are taken aback by the mindset of programming that they realize they need to adopt
5391004 weve had occasions where people have ported over software to symbian os from other operating systems and it has fallen afoul of our built in checks
5391005 theyve concluded that their software is leaking memory on every other implementation they have on windows and so forth but its never been caught before
5391006 we used a lot of features of c in an exacting way
5391007 as a result we have a design which is future proof scalable and extensible and this is often what drives companies to choose symbian os the architecture has led a lot of support to us
5391008 we often get pleasantly surprised at what third parties do
5391009 for camera phones for example third parties are able to write add ons that build on the functionality of the camera itself its gone much faster than many of us expected its really the power of the open platform driving the innovation
5391010 the open platform allows developers to gain access to a large market very quickly even on their first implementation of a particular technology
5391011 so the biggest concern from a developers perspective is are people buying the platform for which you want to sell a product
5391012 in 12 months symbian will have done what palm did in five years
5391013 so for a developer deciding which os to focus their energy on symbian represents a really strong growth opportunity
5391014 having merged a camera with the device nokia and sony ericsson have hit on a really interesting market
5391015 you can spend 200 get a really cool phone that has web browsing and by the way has a camera in it and theyve seen fantastic results the nokia 7650 has outsold their expectations
5391016 as a tool vendor you want to make sure that youre building a tool to support the platform thats going to be ubiquitous in the marketplace because thats the one from which your developers stand to make the most money
5391017 their fate is very closely aligned with the fate of series 60 and nokia
5391018 its a very important user interface and one that can make or break them
5391019 by joining the series 60 program theyve reduced their r amp d burden on that side which allows them to spend more time differentiating on the hardware features of the phone or on applications to be delivered with the phone
5391020 if a platform is to be successful you have to control the developers and empower them to build applications

5391027 in terms of operating systems for mobile devices symbian is really at the head of the class
5391028 the initial phones that have come out are visibly high end but theyre already selling at pretty low prices
5391029 over time youll see symbian os used increasingly in mid range phones
5391030 its going to broaden beyond its core voice functionality into a huge range of differentiated products that will meet the needs of different market groups
5391031 the nokia n gage gaming console is just one example of how the phone will morph into a range of different markets
5391032 its much like the car industry the model t was the only car on the market until someone else created a new type of car

5391034 in the midwest coal is plentiful and low cost and finding ways to burn it cleanly is fundamental to meeting our customers demand for power

5391036 knox county residents unified to embrace this project and move it forward the federal state and local tax incentives help close the gap between the higher costs of building a cleaner coal gasification plant compared to traditional technology

5391077 the strategic challenge for our website was to grow our customer base by transferring the trust our customers has with our in store experience to the virtual world
5391078 before we adopted comodo we were not achieving great business results because our customers did not trust our site as much as we needed them to we decided to replace all our previous security solutions and use comodos ecommerce accelerator kit instead the results have been amazing
5391079 increasing customer confidence and trust is a critical requirement for most online businesses and our approach manages the trust building process from a number of different perspectives
5391080 said melih abdulhayoglu ceo and chief security architect of comodo
5391081 by implementing the ecommerce accelerator kit emerchants can deploy a set of trust building solutions proven to improve the key metrics of any online business visitor conversion and transactional value the results of excaliburcutlery com demonstrate how comodo is building business for our customers easily and economically

5391104 the program is not replacing anything but that people might find it a more preferable medium to engage in conversations about healthcare
5391105 the status quo is very tough to change the question should be can we make the changes necessary to save the wild rockies or is it more important to save the montana wilderness association mwa or the montana congressional delegation from the winds of change to do both may be impossible
5391106 i agree that compromise is a key component in moving forward i do feel however that sometimes coming to a compromise is not enough if compromise is just moving us back to neutral then it truly is not a compromise
5391107 i see no reason to compromise over watershed health thats why i support the northern rockies ecosystem protection act nrepa and find the refusal of the mwa and other brown groups i prefer brown to gray but thats just negative aesthetics to be just plain absurd lets get more wilderness and then declare independence
5391108 more nrepa like bills would help a great deal a 4 corners bill or a new england bill could reinforce and broaden support for the ecosystem approach nationwide at some point we need to turn a corner and never look back at the failed state delegation process protocol in the house and senate does more to kill wilderness than orvs and big timber combined national interest bills are the wave of the future and the best perhaps only way to overcome congressional protocol
5391109 there should be not one single square meter of additional wilderness designation until other lands have been allocated similar protections for economic use and those protections have operated satisfactorily for ten or more years earth first lets take care of the other planets later
5391110 the hard work of conservation is grubbing it out with the other interests in an effort to do good for the land and for people to restore forests to reduce stream temperatures to protect wilderness where you can anyone can spend all day demanding the moon never having to account for accomplishing nothing
5391111 practically we need three things in the west more wilderness more big game winter range and fewer people
5391112 what would bob marshall think if he were alive today i am pretty sure that lee metcalf would never let this unending stalemate continue what is missing in montana conservation groups is real leadership people with the ability to unite
5391113 all i know is that collaboration and consensus has left conservation in worse shape now than when we knew we had a fight on our hands
5391114 nrepas greatest attribute is as a foil to another bill the internal politics of the mwa are interesting but it seems to me montana needs at least one of two things to happen 1 mt needs the 2nd house seat back its way too easy for rehberg to block things as the only rep from montana 2 tester needs to introduce a wilderness bill baucus isnt going to but with a d in the white house tester has a chance to get a bill through
5391115 the only possible practical decision for green conservationists as opposed to collaborationist brown conservationists in the short term is to hold fast for nrepa and other science based conservation proposals undercut dangerous compromises and wait until we get a real democrat in the white house next year and by that i mean barack obama
5391116 i support nrepa it is the right thing to do for conservation and over the long run for maximum sustainable economic growth as well
5391117 the greenwashing appears to be working well on our politicos in the state i am not sure what it will take for them to realize one of the most valuable assets of this state is our wilderness county commissioners bemoan wilderness while crying aloud for economic development funding yet a look at the greatest land value increases along with economic development in montana shows they have and continue to happen nearest wilderness areas the old west will destroy us eventually may our politicians and their cronies in compromise wake up before it to late
5391118 something so simple as standing up for the men and women under your command is fraught with danger to ones career
5391119 this is a discussion about protecting our last priceless vestige of land that sustains us as a nation not only in terms of clean water wildlife and primitive recreation opportunity for our descendents but even more importantly wilderness sustains the flame of freedom which flickers still within the hearts of all americans the fact that so many people are posting about this just proves this point wilderness is freedom protect it
5391120 i agree that nrepa is well almost as important as anilca its way smaller in size but maybe thats what makes it as important as you say thats all thats left
5391121 environmental groups remind me of the army navy and marines they all have a common goal but competing interests in the process they lose sight of their duty in this case stop the in fighting and get as much protection as possible for our last remaining wildlands 25 years of failure should be enough evidence that the current method is not working
5391122 open honest discussion and a free exchange of ideas is a central tenant of democracy these public lands including the beaverhead deerlodge national forest belong equally to all americans not just to a few multi million dollar brown groups and a few timber mills
5391123 i get the impression that some folks have never visited a national forest wilderness area i suggest calming down taking a break quit worrying about money and gasoline and wars and politics for just a little while take a walk or a horseback ride to a place where the loudest sound you hear is an elk bugling coyote yipping or water so clear and clean that you can see the bottom of the deepest lake rushing down a creak bed sleep under the stars take a deep breath of air so clean that it invigorates your soul and know with every fiber of your being that this will all be here to hunt fish or simply enjoy unchanged for your great grandchildren that my friends is wilderness
5391124 the elephant in the room is our disinterested montana congressional delegation when was the last field hearing on wilderness even the rocky mountain front was protected from oil and gas development with not a single acre of wilderness designated im afraid representatives from idaho wyoming and the eastern parts of oregon and washington arent any more interested delivering pork to the colonies is almost more than they can handle add fundraising which takes more time than conducting the publics business and these sad souls are just too tuckered out to bother shame on all of us for allowing this year after year in the end we get the government we deserve
5391125 the snyder titus letter sheds a lot of light on the brown green conflict in montanas wilderness protection community thanks for running it as yet another former mwa council member disappointed that its selected priorities depart from its charter and purposes i hope mwa can get itself together enough to run the snyder titus critique in wild montana

5391195 the way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one but to divide it among the many distributing to every one exactly the functions he is competent to let the national government be entrusted with the defense of the nation and its foreign and federal relations the state governments with the civil rights law police and administration of what concerns the state generally the counties with the local concerns of the counties and each ward direct the interests within itself it is by dividing and subdividing these republics from the great national one down through all its subordinations until it ends in the administration of every mans farm by himself by placing under every one what his own eye may superintend that all will be done for the best what has destroyed liberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed under the sun the generalizing and concentrating all cares and powers into one body

5391239 on a whim i let my hair grow wild as it had been when i was teenager immediately in very small but significant ways my life changed i started getting speeding tickets all the time and i had never gotten any before i started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention and one day while walking along 14th street in downtown manhattan a police van pulled up on the sidewalk and three officers jumped out they were looking it turned out for a rapist and the rapist they said looked a lot like me they pulled out the sketch and the description i looked at it and pointed out to them as nicely as i could that in fact the rapist looked nothing at all like me he was much taller and much heavier and about fifteen years younger and i added in a largely futile attempt at humor not nearly as good looking all we had in common was a large head of curly hair after twenty minutes or so the officers finally agreed with me and let me go on a scale of things i realize this was a trivial misunderstanding african americans in the united state suffer indignities far worse than this all the time but what struck me was how even more subtle and absurd the stereotyping was in my case this wasnt about something really obvious like skin color or age or height or weight it was just about hair something about the first impression created by my hair derailed every other consideration in the hunt for the rapist and the impression formed in those first two seconds exerted a powerful hold over the officers thinking over the next twenty minutes that episode on the street got me thinking about the weird power of first impressions

5391279 gods compassion is not according to our concept of his compassion his compassion is that he would do his very best to get anyone closer to him and get him out of the rut of these constant reincarnations so his compassion would always be directed towards getting people out of the maze of illusion in one form or another and the best way to get them out of illusion is to bestow upon them not relief from suffering but more suffering thats his compassion it seems ridiculous it seems preposterous that the compassionate one should shower upon us this suffering but that is the only good weapon that he can utilize in order to make us turn towards him and face him all other little trinkets that may be bestowed upon you by others who are advanced on the spiritual path and who have got some powers they might give you limbs and they might give you sight or they might even raise you from your death bed and all that but that is not real compassion if it entangles you more and more in the mazes of illusion so his real compassion is to get you out of the maze of illusion and the remedy is that you always call out to him and when do you call out to him well when your fingers get burned or when your backbone gets ripped or hurt and so forth then you call out with all your heart

5391443 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5391444 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women

5391453 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
5391454 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
5391455 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
5391456 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer

5391459 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5391460 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5391461 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

5391468 people do not as a rule buy pornography in their own neighborhoods

5391476 over the past four years liz claiborne inc has conducted research into the many aspects of teen dating abuse what makes this current study so disturbing is the clear and unexpected finding that dating abuse and violence begins at such a young age
5391477 we applaud the willingness of attorney general lynch to push for the introduction of education about dating abuse in schools across the country this research shows just how urgently this information is needed
5391478 we are committed to addressing this issue through education abuse and violence in intimate partner relationships not only cause great individual pain but this destructive behavior breaks down families communities and our larger society
5391479 a curriculum such as liz claiborne inc s love is not abuse is an effective way to begin the process of education prevent abuse and help to save lives
5391480 the surveys data on the extent of emotional and controlling behaviors among tweens are the most critical additions to our current knowledge of abuse in adolescent relationships
5391481 the numbers of tweens in relationships who report experiencing emotional abuse and controlling behaviors are staggering clearly this shows that many young people are already experiencing unhealthy relationships early on even in the absence of sexual activity many recognize these behaviors as not acceptable but few know where to seek help or how to help a friend
5391482 as a sexuality educator it is impossible for me to look at this data without acknowledging the cultural implications and perhaps reasons for the statistics
5391483 i believe the biggest problem is that parents are not doing their job parents are not talking to their teens about healthy and responsible sexuality
5391484 the survey data demonstrates that although parents maintain they are discussing relationships with their teens this is not the same as discussing violence and abuse in relationships
5391485 it is clear parents need to talk to teens tweens and schools need to encourage healthy relationship programs at an earlier age the survey indicates that tweens are involved in relationships that they consider serious therefore parents need to talk prevention before dating starts in the same way that parents currently tell 5 year olds that smoking is bad they need to say that people who love each other shouldnt hit punch kick hurt each other

5391495 despite the high profile standards based relaunches of major sites such as http www smh com au many web developers are only now beginning to understand the importance of these issues to remain relevant and in the game web designers developers and decision makers must understand the fundamental standards and practices developed by the w3c which ensure the web remains and becomes increasingly world wide

5391502 sexual assault has decreased by two thirds since 1993 this continued downward trend indicates that tremendous progress has been made in the fight against sexual violence the dramatic cultural shift in public awareness and attitudes about rape combined with tougher crime policies has resulted in great strides towards our goal of eliminating sexual violence

5391517 adoption of ifrs is not just about understanding technical accounting differences companies will need to understand the impact such differences have on technology and information systems
5391518 ifrs adoption generally cant be accomplished by finance alone technology executives and their functions should be brought into the visioning and planning stages early in order to avoid potentially costly rework at a later date
5391519 and as adoption rules outside of the united states are running on various timetables it is also important to have a global strategy around adoption to avoid reimplementation for international sites once the u s organization determines its approach

5391560 acidification of the earths ocean water could have far reaching impacts on the health of our near shore environment and on the sustainability of ecosystems that support human populations through nourishment and jobs
5391561 this research is vital to understanding the processes within the ocean as well as the consequences of a carbon rich atmosphere
5391562 evidence for upwelling of corrosive acidified water onto the continental shelf
5391563 our findings represent the first evidence that a large section of the north american continental shelf is seasonally impacted by ocean acidification
5391564 this means that ocean acidification may be seriously impacting marine life on our continental shelf right now
5391565 while this absorption provides a great service to humans by significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and decreasing the effects of global warming the change in the ocean chemistry affects marine life particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells such as corals mussels mollusks and small creatures in the early stages of the food chain
5391566 we did not expect to see this extent of ocean acidification until the middle to the end of the century
5391567 because of this effort we have a baseline for future observations as we continue to study and monitor the relationship of biological and physical processes and their ability to respond to ocean acidification
5391568 we did not expect to see this extent of ocean acidification until the middle to the end of the century
5391569 because of this effort we have a baseline for future observations as we continue to study and monitor the relationship of biological and physical processes and their ability to respond to ocean acidification
5391570 when the upwelled water was last at the surface it was exposed to an atmosphere with much less co 2 than today and future upwelled waters will probably be more acidic than todays because of increasing atmospheric co 2
5391571 we dont know how this will affect species living in the zone below the level of the lowest tides out to the edge of the continental shelf
5391572 we do know that organisms like corals or pteropods are affected by water saturated with co 2 the impacts on other species such as shellfish and other juvenile fish that have economic significance are not yet fully understood
5391573 in baja california we have several mediterranean climate coastal lagoons where the main external physical and biogeochemical forcing is from the neighboring coastal ocean strongly influenced by upwelling
5391574 we are concerned about these areas because they play an important role as nurseries and feeding grounds of juvenile fish populations but are also are ideal sites for shellfish aquaculture

5391585 theres no question that asus is raising the bar with its laptops the only foreseeable problem is retail presence because the asus m50sa a1 is offered exclusively through newegg a reputable online retailer you have to judge systems based on reviews and pictures rather than being able to check them out in person but since other asus laptops are showing up at local best buys and popular retail names such as j amp r music world its probably only a matter of time before the m50sa appears at brick and mortar stores
5391586 weve no doubt that many people are going to hail the asus eee 900 as another rip roaring success and at least in some ways wed tend to agree but before you rush out and buy one
5391587 the leather clad asus u6s is an ultraportable that will require you to tote around a little extra weight in return for its power and ports it carries a fair price but we would like it more

5391852 users depend on the internet more and more and they need to know that the internet can be trusted with their most personal and sensitive information
5391853 any atheist who debated me with no belief would have a hard time articulating his her position
5391854 so far there has been zero observation supporting intelligent design
5391855 postulating hypothetical historical events and patterns of events which if actual would explain a variety of presently observed data
5391856 demarcation arguments have collapsed philosophers of science do not hold them anymore they still enjoy acceptance in the popular world but thats a different world
5391857 high information content or specified complexity and irreducible complexity constitute high indicators or hall marks for intelligent design
5391858 the sequence specificity seen in proteins depends on the prior specificity i e information encoded in dna
5391859 biological systems have a high information content or specified complexity and utilize subsystems that manifest irreducible complexity
5391860 naturalistic mechanisms or undirected causes do not suffice to explain the origin of information specified complexity or irreducible complexity
5391861 how can we account for the irreducible complexity of biological systems
5391862 how do we account for the origin of the specified information that governs such systems
5391863 therefore based on the preceding three premises intelligent design constitutes the best explanation for the origin of information and irreducible complexity in biological systems
5391864 the origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories
5391865 and in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make

5391899 developed and tested an asat system described as a parasitic microsatellite
5391900 to an october 2000 internet posting in china by a self described military enthusiast who claimed that he had originally developed the idea in the 1990s and suggested it to the chinese government
5391901 subsequent versions of the report with no explanation in the report of why this supposed threat vanished
5391902 the pentagon did not repeat this claim in the 2004 2005 2006 or 2007 editions of the report
5391903 the us and israel have never signed the space based weapons treaty
5391904 they have even stated that they intend to place weapons in space
5391905 china will not participate in any kind of arms race in outer space

5391907 the world bank is currently working on the terms of reference for the study of alternatives which is expected to take less than six months and will be conducted by a three member entity representing jordan palestine and israel
5391908 jordan and israel both extract significant amounts of water for the use of agriculture and municipal areas
5391909 there are some extractions from syria on the yarmouk basin and a very small amount of water extracted by lebanon but the majority of water is being used by jordan and israel
5391910 the red dead scheme would help end the countrys large water deficit that stands at 400 million cubic metres of water annually
5391911 this is the best project to provide water through desalination plants and preserve the dead sea from vanishing
5391912 if the dead sea is not rescued a major disaster to the environment will occur in the area
5391913 all the sinkholes in the area will turn into muddy areas with the drop in the water level and this is very unsafe to people
5391914 palestine has rights to part of the dead sea coastline and palestine shares the concerns of other parties over the drop in the water level of the dead sea and wishes to conserve that unique resource
5391915 in addition the present plans suggest that palestine would receive a significant volume of desalinated water from the red sea dead sea project were it to be constructed
5391916 palestine has by far the lowest availability of freshwater of any of the countries bordering the jordan river basin and one of the lowest availabilities of freshwater of any country in the world
5391917 israel is deeply interested in saving the dead sea and the creation of a source for desalinated water for use in the region
5391918 there are no foregone conclusions here that we are going to build anything because we do not know if it is feasible from a technical standpoint or an environmental and social standpoint
5391919 first we will do the feasibility studies then we will decide if we need to do something
5391920 this has to be determined it is a political decision as well there have to be discussions and it is up to the governments there is no assignment in the terms of reference of water and power use it will be determined between the beneficiaries
5391921 there is a lot of desire on the part of the beneficiary parties to make the studies last for 18 months however we have done all the procurement and the bidding and we asked people to prepare proposals on the basis of 24 months
5391922 we have signed contracts with the consultants for 24 months and we have told the consultants if it is possible we would like to finish before that
5391923 i am confused master their positions regarding the issue are completely opposite they cant be both right how could you say that they are both correct

5391970 the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion
5391971 we are not going to suggest people support one particular party
5391972 i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed
5391973 in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20
5391974 however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice

5391984 the danger is clear and its growing as weve seen recently
5391985 he might support non violence but he does not support violence and riots
5391986 there are points of view that are opposed to the dalai lama and perhaps this flag
5391987 im not so deep into politics but i want to contribute in any way i can to bring a change
5391988 you can just let it go even though they have their opinions and you have your opinions you can stop it

5391992 they experienced first hand the good work that chabad does on this campus
5391993 rabbi webb and gitty do a lot of wonderful things for the jewish community on campus but they have been somewhat limited because rabbi webb was not a university chaplain
5391994 he will now have the freedom he needs to be even more successful
5391995 now that hes a chaplain many more students will be able to benefit from their presence on campus
5391996 by rabbi webb becoming a chaplain the university is officially endorsing him and giving him their support
5391997 this is a very big thing because to jewish students who have not yet participated in jewish events on campus it may seem that the center for jewish life is the only option
5391998 now however it will be very clear that the jewish community consists of a wide range of programming
5391999 rabbi webb will be able to attract even more students who desire to become more involved in some way

5392021 look it wont happen without someone there in the middle east the only reason we got the breakthrough in northern ireland was that we did in the end focus on it with such intensity over such a period that every little thing that went wrong and everything that could go wrong did at some point was all the time being managed and rectified jonathan powell my chief of staff once said to me that the important thing about this is that at any time we cant solve it we have to manage it until we can start to solve it again what you never do is let the thing govern itself

5392026 look at the metropolitan community church today the gay church almost accepted into the world council of churches recently the national council of churches almost the vote was against them but they will try again and again until they get in and the tragedy is that they would get one vote because they are spoken of here in jude as being brute beasts that is going to the baser lust of the flesh to live immorality and so jude describes this as apostasy thank god this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven

5392052 just to follow on from the over reliance on automated tools a point i fully endorse by making one further observation on the use of automated tools in this case bobby one great problem we are having with bobby is that i have found that like any software it does have small bugs in it to watchfires credit i was able to get past the no can do support chap and get to a more senior manager who did investigate my issues in detail and got the bugs fixed quickly however there are two outstanding problems with bobby that all web developers need to watch for 1 bobby sometimes think a telephone or fax number or house number is a fixed font size setting and will return an error on your page trivial but it goes to show the fallibility of any software product even one so universal in use 2 bobby consistently returns an error in regard to the naming of anchors labels ids that is if you have an anchor such as content or faq 1 a form label attribute name id such as search or name bobby will flag this as an error as it has some sort of internal vocabulary of unacceptable hypertext or text requiring context this is both very subjective and at times completely inappropriate when it starts to pick up html elements that cannot be heard or seen by the site visitor anyway if bobby issued warnings rather than errors that would be fine but as it is it makes the business of creating aa and aaa compliant sites that bit more cumbersome in fact i have now been involved in auditing several websites that are aaa compliant in every respect but which bobby continue to fail on this bogus aa issue weve tried to change the code and text but nothing seems to work ive been on the watchfire site and i can see much discussion on this issue so it is a real problem out there for many web designers that watchfire have failed to address at the end of the day i do not care too much as i know the websites are accessible and if i cant put on a bobby logo it is not an issue for me there are plenty of instances where the opposite is the case anyway

5392256 get a little bit more involved and ask ok whats the procedure here what are you doing to my dog and if theyre reluctant about showing you the place walk away
5392257 a lot of people call it a noose but i call it a safety noose because it sounds better

5392400 in the matter of absolute poker investigation regarding complaints of cheating
5392401 when absolute poker notified the kgc of the security breach in our system we had every expectation that the commission would undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation
5392402 the kgc points out that ap has taken the appropriate actions to address the vulnerability in its systems and to prevent its systems from being compromised again ap has appointed a team of both internal and external members to improve controls and install safeguards and accepts the audit findings as an opportunity to improve our internal practices and guarantee the safest playing environment in the industry
5392403 we are pleased that the kgcs findings of fact point out that there is no evidence to indicate that the impugned activities were initiated or sanctioned by ap or were intended to benefit ap as a corporate entity
5392404 the company also regrets the inadvertent deletion of certain gaming logs and records during the course of the investigation although ap is relieved that these deletions did not according to the kgc prevent the commission from obtaining sufficient information
5392405 having experienced first hand the devastating impact of a security breach we fully appreciate the importance of trust and security for ap itself and the broader industry

5392532 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5392533 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5392534 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

5392549 there is no question that the adult classifieds of their print and online editions consist primarily of solicitations for prostitution and promotion of businesses that front for prostitution
5392550 the recent investigation and raid of so called massage parlors and spas that were fronting for prostitution once again drive home the obvious these ads are promoting illegal activity and are contributing to the exploitation and trafficking of women

5392557 publications have a choice about whether to run certain ads
5392558 if they have any reason to believe that businesses are conducting illicit activities they have a social responsibility to report it to the authorities or at the very least not run the business advertisements
5392559 there is some percentage of people who are not willing participants in the sex industry
5392560 new york press no longer marketing arm for prostitution trafficking
5392561 traffickers supply the local brothel market to meet demand for commercial sex

5392578 the lead singer of black cash actually just had a son so hes going to be spending time with his family which we totally understand and were very happy for him
5392579 we brought together the eight alumni sponsors who were interested in putting up 100 as an initial investment and then all the ticket proceeds that go past covering the cost of staff will go back to the universities
5392580 all the profits will be split up evenly among the sponsoring universities for them to use towards a charity or a scholarship
5392581 theres an event that chris and i are trying to assist with were not putting it on by any means but its with the richmond braves
5392582 this being their last year theyre doing an event where its a show your pride night and theyll be sectioning off where each university will be to show their pride at the braves game but that wont be for another two months
5392583 in the 1950s three or four kids had to compete for whatever spending money one working parent chose to distribute
5392584 the echo is big but not as big as the almost 10 million strong boom just as movie theatres for kids are mushrooming so casinos and golf courses are popping up everywhere to accomodate aging boomers who are entering their prime gambling and golfing years life has become more complex for retailers and providers of recreational educational and other services they must be able to satisfy the different needs of two growth markets one composed of people in their teens and 20s and another of people in their 50s

5392632 les changes prennent une tournure non seulement corporatiste comme dhabitude mais aussi tout fait condescendante vis vis des non juristes qui sont pris pour des non comprenants born s par nos valeureux experts pleins dintrospection surtout quand la dite introspection porte en fait sur madame dati ou le l gislateur
5392633 le d mon corporatiste ou la conscience du juge dans la tradition juridique fran aise

5392644 on est tous d sol s davoir vous le dire et vous le r p ter mais la justice nest pas une entreprise cest une aventure ca y ressemble mais cest tr s diff rent
5392645 comment croire quun seul juge apr s le travail pr alable de ses coll gues va tout remettre en cause lui tout seul dans lurgence et la discontinuit sans laide dun d bat public et avec une d fense intermittente
5392646 ne croyez vous pas que justement le probl me cest que le simple soup on de p dophilie ait suffi pour vacuer compl tement de lesprit des juges le contenu du dossier ainsi que les arguments des d tenus
5392647 il reste toutefois quil nest pas acceptable quon jette des magistrats en p ture lopinion publique m me lorsquils ont pu faillir parce que cest tout le syst me judiciaire et le respect n cessaire la fonction de magistrat qui sont branl s

5392663 ah bon parce que mettre des innocents en prison ce nest pas une faute
5392664 pourquoi ne pas envisager un contr le transversal par des personnes ext rieures au dossier non concern es par son aboutissement dans un sens dans un autre et pourquoi pas ext rieures au monde judiciaire mais qui auraient acc s la totalit des pi ces ou lanalyse dun simili dossier mais par exemple anonymis par des juges dun autre ressort ou par des universitaires
5392665 parce quil a une double casquette il est la fois enqu teur et arbitre donc pris dans une contradiction intellectuelle dun c t il doit d velopper son enqu te de lautre il va en tirer les conclusions d cider du renvoi ou non des personnes devant le tribunal
5392666 le parquet ferait lenqu te lui m me condition bien s r quil soit ind pendant

5392698 my mother was ruby patton a very well respected musician in the cleveland ohio area with some national standing as a church musician i was the oldest of five children and a regular part of our upbringing was to learn to play the piano so i really cant remember not being able to read music i did the usual sang in and played for church and school choirs and in our house we grew up listening to everything my folks really loved the big bands and swing music so we heard a lot of that
5392699 there were variety shows where one could see ella fitzgerald and the count basie band
5392700 i remember seeing ella sing with duke ellington on television and with joe pass once the nat king cole show was just swinging
5392701 because its all given you know what i mean but the regular comment i tended to get was something like thats nice but it isnt quite right it seems to me that when performing pop music one really needs to be like a record player everyone knows how it goes so you just reproduce what everyone knows so it was more or less put on me that i was trying to be a jazz musician because everything i did was kind of my way anyway

5392704 i still call him to see how he is to hear his voice
5392705 he has a way of teaching maybe coaching is a better term he doesnt crank out jazz musicians he doesnt show you how to be a jazz musician he has a way of helping you discover what you want to do how you want to express yourself hes one of the most thoughtful persons i have met in my life

5392743 along the north side where the basement structure remained strong and intact and was ultimately preserved the fire had been so intense in places that it had consumed the tires and interiors and had left hulks sitting on axles above hardened pools of aluminum wheels
5392744 the debris pile sat cooking for weeks with the materials at the bottom of the pile getting incresingly hot beacuse the fires were confined and lost minimal heat to the atmosphere as a result the fires could have easily reached temps sufficient to melt steel not to mention most other metals found in the buildings
5392745 it is no mystery why the fire has burned for so long mangled steel and concrete plastics from office furniture and equipment fuels from elevator hydraulics cars and other sources are all in great supply in the six story basement area where the two towers collapsed water alone rarely can quench this kind of fire which will burn as long as there is adequate fuel and oxygen and as long as heat cannot escape fire experts said
5392746 nist investigators and experts from the american society of civil engineers asce and the structural engineers association of new york seony who inspected the wtc steel at the wtc site and the salvage yards found no evidence that would support the melting of steel in a jet fuel ignited fire in the towers prior to collapse the condition of the steel in the wreckage of the wtc towers i e whether it was in a molten state or not was irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the wtc towers were standing nist considered the damage to the steel structure and its fireproofing caused by the aircraft impact and the subsequent fires when the buildings were still standing since that damage was responsible for initiating the collapse of the wtc towers under certain circumstances it is conceivable for some of the steel in the wreckage to have melted after the buildings collapsed any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile than to short exposure to fires or explosions while the buildings were standing
5392747 a study of the 1991 oakland fire that burned 3 000 homes revealed the presence of melted copper in over 80 of the burned structures and what appeared to be melted steel in over 90 of the burned structures with respect to steel looks can be deceiving what appears to be melted may be merely oxidized interpret melted metals particularly steel with caution and interpret the temperatures you infer from these melted metals with extreme caution
5392748 it is not possible to tell by visual examination alone whether a piece of steel has melted or merely oxidized

5393073 in short the vostro 1310 is an excellent addition to the vostro family and gives business professionals and consumers on a budget a low cost alternative to the dell xps m1330 unfortunately the price as configured 1 357 places it neck and neck with the xps m1330 although the vostro is a great system at the entry level price of just 749 once the price exceeds 1 000 most consumers and even many business professionals would be better off with the xps m1330
5393074 in summary the dell vostro 1700 is a budget home office mobile desktop replacement its value for money is excellent but do not expect it to excel in anything
5393075 the dell vostro 1500 is a moderately powerful and relatively inexpensive system for businesses and home users alike its good build quality and good configuration options allow it to be an excellent and versatile machine for many different
5393076 the dell vostro 1400 is an excellent choice for the price it offers a wide variety of special features including a webcam optional microphone discreet graphics card optional it also provides impressive battery life for its
5393077 its been a while since dell delivered a laptop that possessed so many awe inspiring features the dell xps m1330 is a monumental step in that it takes the best things from other great ultraportables and combines them
5393078 overall i am very pleased with dell latitude d520 while this particular configuration lacks in high end bells and whistles like a top of the line processor or dedicated graphics it does offer an excellent balance of power save 25 corsair dual channel twinx 2048mb pc6400 ddr2 memory 33 save 250 gateway laptop intel pentium dual core 1 60ghz wireless 15 4

5393127 id say if you cant bother to build it yourself get potential customers lined up build revenue on an easier offshoot or convince someone else to build it in their spare time then you should reevaluate whether you are an entrepreneur
5393128 the idea is the easy part if you are a first time entrepreneur try scaling down your concept to something whose value you can prove with friends amp family money then go to professional investors if your idea does not lend itself to such an approach try your hand first with something you can bootstrap

5393141 the issue is the abuse of power over the vulnerable and john mccain just does not seem to get it
5393142 this is a significant development as until now weve usually found mobile trojans two or three at a time at the most it would be easy for a malware writer to create 1 trojan and give it 52 different names however this is not the case here where we have 52 separately cracked and infected applications somebody has gone to an awful lot of time and effort to turn these out
5393143 previous mobile viruses have either been able to spread but cause no harm or alternatively have been able cause significant harm but not able to spread it may be that producing large numbers of harmful trojans such as those we discovered today is a reaction by the writers to their inability to produce destructive viruses that can effectively spread obviously by producing large numbers of these things you greatly improve the odds of someone actually downloading and installing them
5393144 until reports are received of these trojans in the wild however there is little risk to end users

5393155 he has always concentrated his efforts on the french race and used the others as a test bed

5393169 this is all a lie there is no truth in this it is total bullshit
5393170 we never prepared such blueprints we are not the designer we are not the proliferator
5393171 this is all a lie there is no truth in this it is total bullshit
5393172 we never prepared such blueprints we are not the designer we are not the proliferator
5393173 it looks like khan did steal them blueprints and try to peddle them
5393174 khan may be released from house arrest and we may never get to the bottom of this
5393175 so i think its very important that we start to put pressure on the governments involved in this to find a way to get to the bottom of it
5393176 khan needs to be interviewed by the by the international atomic energy agency
5393177 the statement is just aimed at putting pressure on the pakistani government the story came when there were talks about removing restrictions on me
5393178 weve been very direct with them that releasing khan could cause a world of trouble
5393179 the western countries are suppliers of the technology they sold it they are the proliferators why dont they publish juicy stories about on the nuclear issue
5393180 the destruction of the information without the approval of the defendants has raised the issue of whether the tinners can receive a fair trial
5393181 defense attorneys can now claim that information to prove their clients innocence was in the destroyed documents
5393182 the tinner brothers could soon be freed from jail or perhaps even have the charges dropped by a court concerned about the swiss governments handling of the evidence
5393183 we have told the government that the iaea pact was negotiated on the basis of the pact with
5393184 signing the pact with iaea means operationalizing the u s indian deal so we are against this
5393185 the new u s congress will not accept the deal in the current form
5393186 it is clear they are ready to move further we will definitely take a formal decision
5393187 people and officials in our country are watchful of the other sides decisions we have options against it
5393188 we have repeatedly said that enrichment is our red line and we should enjoy this technology the work will be continued
5393189 we will give our answer to the six nation proposal as soon as possible but we do not know exactly when it will be
5393190 the only way in my judgment to diplomatically solve these kinds of problems with nations like iran and north korean nontransparent nations is through a multilateral process where theres more than one nation sending the same message to the leaders of these respective countries
5393191 the facts are the six party talks is the only way to send a message to the north koreans that the world isnt going to tolerate them having a weapon
5393192 disclose what they have manufactured and eventually turn it over
5393193 well see what they disclose but we hopefully are in the process of disabling and dismantling their plutonium manufacturing
5393194 were hopefully in the process of disclosing their proliferation activities
5393195 it is a positive thing and i hope the north koreans will take it seriously
5393196 hopefully it will produce substantive results that will allow the japanese to participate at some point in whatever aid package might be put together
5393197 vice president xi jinping will exchange views on issues of common concern including the nuclear issue on the
5393198 the power of the atom has become one of the most highly sought after prizes of 21st century technological advancement states want to harness its power for energy weapons deterrence and prestige substate actors desire it for the asymmetric power of becoming a state
5393199 nuclear terrorism therefore is not a single point issue but a strategic problem that will continue to grow in significance throughout the 21st century to meet this threat we must make a strategic shift from our traditional views of terrorism proliferation nuclear weapons and nuclear energy as being separate entities and instead view them as parts of a single framework of all things nuclear
5393200 the continuing instances of trafficking in nuclear materials mean we collectively have not done enough to keep material out of the hands of terrorists
5393201 we must take urgent action to scoop up any nuclear material outside state control before terrorists do
5393202 the world will be confronted by the nuclear genie in his malevolent forms for the foreseeable future
5393203 we must adapt our intelligence and policy efforts to confront the threat along its entire continuum in a persistent sustained manner
5393204 we are adapting our defenses against such new threats as for example terrorist threats the risk of nuclear proliferation
5393205 this is now the sixth chemical weapons destruction facility brought on line s destruction capacity to meet that deadline
5393206 just a milligram of deadly chemical agents is enough to kill persons living in an apartment
5393207 exports of u s origin commodities to these entities are restricted and require prior authorization in the form of a license
5393208 ive looked at whats going on around the globe and to me it almost looks like a sprint not a marathon to get certain capabilities particularly the intermediate range and the intercontinental range
5393209 countries are working very hard and diligently on those to ballistic missile programs
5393210 the most troubling aspect about iran is what they could be doing in the nuclear business combined with what they could be doing in the space business which could then lead to an icbm class missile perhaps with a nuclear tip on it
5393211 we continue to see work that is geared toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile
5393212 perhaps we can begin to devalue some of their iranian missiles
5393213 it would be terribly short sighted if we didnt move toward
5393214 the navy should consider exploring other complementary interceptor options if it aims to be effective at more than regional theater missile defense around the asian and european perimeter
5393215 it is probably too large to be accommodated aboard existing destroyers and cruisers without extensive and expensive modifications but there are other hull options that might be worth exploring converted trident submarines amphibious hulls our next generation cruiser cgx
5393216 in todays context it makes far more sense to think in terms of a portfolio of missile defense capabilities that can range from theater to intercontinental from boost to terminal and potentially handle rogue states as well as emerging great powers like
5393217 we have thought that it was vulnerability for a number of years this work seems to show that the vulnerability is there
5393218 does not significantly increase the barrier to theft or use in a nuclear bomb
5393219 the mix is more radioactive by almost a factor of 100 than the pure plutonium but its more than 100 times less radioactive than what the international atomic energy agency considers self protecting
5393220 you could separate the plutonium from this mix in a glove box
5393221 seeks to develop worldwide consensus on enabling expanded use of economical carbon free nuclear energy to meet growing electricity demand this will use a nuclear fuel cycle that enhances energy security while promoting nonproliferation it would achieve its goal by having nations with secure advanced nuclear capabilities provide fuel services fresh fuel and recovery of used fuel to other nations who agree to employ nuclear energy for power generation purposes only
5393222 as stalin would say quantity has a quality all of its own
5393223 these things can be operated to make very good material they dont just make poor reactor grade material
5393224 the report errantly assumes that doe has preselected the separations technologies to be deployed and the scale of the facilities to be built a series of critical findings are based on these incorrect premises
5393225 the weapons are to be determined at a subsequent phase the declaration at this point the purpose of it is to list all of their nuclear materials and all their nuclear facilities and programs
5393226 the north koreans acknowledged that we have to deal with the weapons but not in this phase
5393227 we know the north koreans have been themselves saying that this thursday would be the date that they submit their declaration
5393228 we will see if that actually happens and if it does it must be correct and verifiable
5393229 it will take many months to verify the amounts of fissile material
5393230 the six party talks are coming up soon and we hope they move the process along and get us to the end goal here which is denuclearization
5393231 we captured 100 percent of all container traffic not just going to the all container traffic to be exported through the radiation portal
5393232 it was successful in our opinion because the benchmark we used was whether it would impact our terminal operations and our customers and business partners operations
5393233 the prime minister has categorically stated that the nuclear deal is one important agenda but the future of the government does not depend on the nuclear deal alone
5393234 at the moment it seems unlikely that the government will risk their electoral prospects especially keeping in mind the inflation
5393235 this illegal and contradictory approach of double standards is meaningless and is strongly denounced
5393236 will waste european opportunities and will not create a suitable atmosphere for solving the matter through diplomacy
5393237 now that you have europe really stepping up and trying to take tangible action it really underscores the fact that it isnt just the u s thats doing it
5393238 im optimistic that were going to be able to find traction in the gulf and in asia
5393239 the nuclear weapons are a hangover from the cold war and must go
5393240 we cannot do without them as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world
5393241 theres no explosives associated with it like a weapon to help disperse it into the atmosphere
5393242 the only thing youd be looking at is evaporation from what would relatively be a minor leak the actual area for most events would probably never leave post
5393243 carol anne listen to me do not go into the light
5393244 cellulosic ethanol made from corn stover and switchgrass could be the next big thing in liquefied energy
5393245 some agronomists question whether taking stover out of the field annually will have a negative impact on soil fertility and structure
5393246 researchers at michigan state are trying to get corn stover to digest itself after harvest
5393247 this research would be an optimization of the processing of stover
5393248 may help prevent soil erosion caused by strong winds or intense rainfall it also replaces lost nutrients and sequesters carbon in the soil lessening co2 accumulation in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas and its contribution to global climate change
5393249 i can tell you the start and complete dates are somewhat of a moving target with respect to development and construction we wont know until were in the process
5393250 certainly that was a concern that went through my head at first
5393251 but i quickly realized it was not affecting the day to day work in albany
5393252 we were called in to do a removal about four years ago and we finished a removal
5393253 the state is overseeing all of the work thats done but were in open communication
5393254 such as when they asked for our help in 2000 we try and answer those calls for help but as for the long term remediation its up to the state and the developers
5393255 a number of factors are coming together to clean up the site knowing what we know now not 20 or 25 years ago
5393256 the benefits are that you would be taking whats currently a blighted site and you would be turning it into a productive asset that would generate on the order of 360 000 a year in local tax dollars
5393257 air quality monitoring during the demolition containment of asbestos which route are the trucks taking where is the debris going these are all of course of great concern if youre a neighbor
5393258 we completely respect the process here and we just have to be patient
5393259 is certainly the concern that has been raised publicly at the meetings will there be enough money and that one specific area was not cleaned up adequately
5393260 with projections of costs we certainly know our world has changed especially in the last 6 months cost of gasoline and oil based products that alone is something that were very aware of
5393261 there will be sufficient funds to do the job and more available from dec to get this clean and clean enough to live on
5393262 though no one can guarantee enough funding i feel confident that that the state of n y has no intention to leave it hanging like that
5393263 as site director mr lynch said we cant promise 100 percent that were going to pay
5393264 were committed to cleaning up the site to the degree that it should be
5393265 i think this is the best opportunity to make this an example of the type of cleanup we would like to see across the u s
5393266 if its not enough money i wont stop lobbying the state of n y to complete what it started and get funding secured
5393267 the purpose of the cag is to enable citizens affected by the former ithaca gun factory site to participate more fully in decisions that affect their health and environment
5393268 in terms of our region this is probably the first one that weve done
5393269 as far as i can tell as a member of the committee the remediation is going to be done by professionals and with a lot of oversight from the health department and dec
5393270 i really do see this as a window of opportunity and i am hoping as a community that we can come together on this and make it happen now
5393271 if it werent to happen now who knows how long it would take again
5393272 if everything goes well and the site is cleaned up properly
5393273 it will be on the list of things under my administration that ive been particularly pleased with
5393274 supports directx 8 0 then it supports shader model 1 1 check the complete list of
5393275 instead of hating the people you think are the warmakers hate the appetites and the disorder in your own soul which are the causes of war if you love peace then hate injustice hate tyranny hate greed but hate these things in yourself not in another

5393284 weve no doubt that many people are going to hail the asus eee 900 as another rip roaring success and at least in some ways wed tend to agree but before you rush out and buy one bear in mind that its not without its issues battery life is pretty poor by ultraportable standards theres still not that much storage space and chubby fingered users are well advised to try before they regret their buy
5393285 the leather clad asus u6s is an ultraportable that will require you to tote around a little extra weight in return for its power and ports it carries a fair price but we would like it more
5393286 the asus lamborghini vx3 is the laptop recast as status symbol it looks and feels like a luxury item we just wish it had a bit more power under the hood

5393317 while some people would say this is a paradox these different responses are mostly consistent with what we know about how the climate system works
5393318 in the arctic there is a combination of factors such as warming of the air because of more greenhouse gases an unusual wind pattern and warming of the ocean water in regions with reduced sea ice
5393319 in the antarctic the changes in winds and temperatures are consistent with how we would expect them to respond to increased greenhouse gases and depletion of stratospheric ozone
5393320 additional warming of the ocean and an overall thinning of the sea ice makes it difficult for the arctic to now return to earlier conditions
5393321 as the ozone hole recovers we expect that warming will appear on the central plateau of antarctica and we will see a reduction in sea ice area

5393384 there are still some misconceptions that steel construction and steel buildings are safe when attacked by fire this is as far from the truth as you can imagine
5393385 relatively small proportional losses of fire protection material are required before sig nificant reductions in fire resistance are realized

5393387 one of the most common structures today is the strip mall built with steel bar joists and metal deck roofs a serious fire in one of these structures should be expected to produce roof collapse in as little as 5 to 10 minutes
5393388 class 1 fire resistive buildings typical of high rise construction usually are designated as having three or four hour fire resistance ratings in the past that was taken to mean that they would never be a serious collapse threat while this is usually the case in the completed structures it is not a guarantee particularly in the steel framed high rise that relies on some type of spray on or membrane fireproofing to protect the steel the 1 meridian plaza fire in philadelphia proved that these can be severe dangers under the wrong set of circumstances

5393394 its a very fluid situation in pakistan at the moment its primarily the external environment were looking at and which we have raised some concerns over we will be monitoring that very closely
5393395 were in very close touch with the pca professional cricketers association
5393396 clearly other boards around the world are in the same position the safety and security of our players is paramount and we wont compromise on that
5393397 from the players point of view we do have major concerns with security in pakistan
5393398 a lot has happened in pakistan from a security point of view since we were there and those are things that are worrying us
5393399 generally thats a full player view i dont know any players who dont have issues with regards to security in pakistan
5393400 there were bombings taking place in karachi and bombings are taking place in lahore now
5393401 within three days of us returning home there was a state of emergency so we have seen how quickly things can develop
5393402 the risks are too great for us to recommend our players go there
5393403 we would expect cricket australia to adopt the same position
5393404 it is only a game of cricket at the end of the day and putting yourself in a position where youre not safe is ridiculous
5393405 we believe this is a poor icc decision we cant see how they have put player safety as their number one priority and this is very disappointing
5393406 our recommendation to our players is not to travel to pakistan at this point in time
5393407 there isnt one player i have spoken to who is comfortable about travelling to pakistan at the moment
5393408 weve still got some very serious concerns despite the fact that the pakistan cricket board have made every effort they can to try to make it as safe as possible
5393409 but unfortunately in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyones control
5393410 i think one thing that the england and wales cricket board has said and something we are very well aligned on is the one thing you are never going to compromise on is security

5393438 today is a great day for bombardier our customers our employees our shareholders and our suppliers i am proud to say that we have met our business plan objectives a technologically advanced aircraft family a strong pipeline of orders and repayable investments with governments and agreements with key suppliers with the latest in system technologies and aerodynamics the cseries family of aircraft will revolutionize the economics and network strategies for airline operations in the 100 to 149 seat commercial market it is another example of our commitment to designing and manufacturing innovative aircraft that will ensure our continued industry leadership
5393439 at lufthansa we are committed to a balance between commercial success environment and business policies oriented toward sustainability
5393440 our initial evaluations of the cseries family of aircraft and discussions with bombardier over the last few months have evolved and made us believe that the cseries family of aircraft clearly meets our stringent requirements for sustainable fleet development both in terms of environmental and commercial requirements and flexibility for the future we are proud to be a part of its launch
5393441 the final assembly facility will be located in mirabel in the greater montr al area thus ensuring bombardiers access to a skilled aerospace workforce and to an established aerospace education system

5393494 i rise in strong opposition to this very terrible bill it does not strike the proper balance between protecting national security and preserving our cherished civil liberties now i know how important those protections are from my personal experience with unwarranted domestic surveillance and wiretapping during the j edgar hoover period the governments infamous cointelpro program ruined the lives of many innocent persons others including myself had their privacy invaded even though they posed absolutely no threat to national security we all remember how dr king and his family were the victims of the most shameful government sponsored wiretapping we must never go down this road again yet here we are again this bill undermines the ability of federal courts to review the legality of domestic surveillance programs it provides de facto retroactive immunity to telecom companies and does not sunset until december 31 2012 how can we do that four years is way too long

5393542 although we earlier determined appellants property interest in his rent free residence at his parents home to be minimal mann supra 278 ga at 443 2 we find appellants property interest in the hibiscus court residence he purchased with his wife to be significant as a registered sex offender the locations where appellant may reside are severely restricted by ocga 42 1 15 a as recognized by other states those locations may also be subject to private limitations see mulligan v panther valley prop owners assn 766 a2d 1186 n j super ct app div 2001 discussing homeowner association covenants prohibiting sale of property to sex offenders and we note that hn5 nothing in ocga 42 1 12 et seq expressly precludes georgia cities and counties from enacting additional restrictions see wernick in accordance with a public outcry zoning out sex offenders through residence restrictions in florida 58 fla l rev 1147 1163 1164 2006 discussing ordinances enacted by local governments in florida that have expanded state statutory buffer zones nevertheless appellant and his wife were able to find and purchase a house that complied with the residency restriction in ocga 42 1 15 the evidence is uncontroverted that the hibiscus court property was purchased for the sole purpose of serving as their home ocga 42 1 15 by prohibiting appellant from residing at the hibiscus court house thus utterly impairs appellants use of his property as the home he shares with his wife
5393543 defendant a convicted sex offender was convicted following a jury trial of knowingly residing within 500 feet of a school building that persons under the age of 18 attended 720 ilcs 5 11 9 3 b 5 west 2006 defendant was sentenced to 30 months probation and fined defendant appeals his conviction and fines we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part turning to the subsection at issue in the instant case we adopt the reasoning and analysis employed by the fifth district in leroy and apply it to the subsection under consideration before us in doing so we find that the law is constitutional we conclude that in accordance with the analysis employed by the court in leroy section 11 9 3 b 5 does not constitute an impermissible ex post facto law therefore defendants argument must fail
5393544 for all of these reasons we hold that indiana code section 35 42 4 11 otherwise known as the residency statute is an ex post facto law as applied to a person in pollards circumstances the residency statute is a criminal statute that criminalizes residency because of the residents status as a sex offender in addition the statutes effect is punitive because it is applied retroactively to sex offenders who established ownership and property rights in a residence prior to the effective date of the statute and because it forces them to relinquish some or all of their ownership rights or face a felony charge perhaps most importantly indianas residency statute does not exempt ownership established prior to the statute provide a constitutional taking procedure or exempt ownership impacted by later construction of a protected facility or area
5393545 floyd wright who was convicted of a sexual offense against a minor in 1977 challenges the district courts ruling that he was subject to the residency restrictions of iowa code section 692a
5393546 the same long standing principles applied in phillips apply in this case as with the registration requirements in phillips the residency restrictions at issue in this case impose a new obligation upon r l and those similarly situated by requiring them to change their place of residence based solely upon offenses committed prior to enactment of the statute attaching new obligations to past conduct in this manner violates the bar on retrospective laws set forth in article i section 13
5393547 defendant john f brownlee jr appellant appeals the courts granting an injunction prohibiting him from residing within 1 000 feet of a school after reviewing the facts of the case and pertinent law we reverse the courts ruling and order the injunction vacated in the instant case appellant bought his home in 1972 he committed the offensive acts in february and march 2003 and the statutes effective date is july 31 2003 accordingly the court erred when it applied r c 2950 031 to appellant and his first assignment of error is sustained
5393548 we hold that hn1r c 2950 031 does not apply to an offender who bought his home and committed his offense before the effective date of the statute the judgment of the first district court of appeals is reversed
5393549 in recent years a number of state or local statutes imposing residency restrictions on registered sex offenders have been enacted in doe v miller 405 f 3d 700 25 a l r 6th 695 8th cir 2005 cert denied 126 s ct 757 163 l ed 2d 574 u s 2005 applying iowa law the court of appeals held that an iowa statute that prohibited persons who had committed a criminal sex offense against a minor from residing within 2 000 feet of a school or child care facility did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was not retroactive criminal punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause did not interfere with the right of sex offenders to travel and did not violate the right against self incrimination under the fifth amendment this annotation collects and summarizes those cases in which the courts have determined the validity of state or local statutes imposing residency restrictions on registered sex offenders
5393550 across america states localities and private communities are debating and implementing laws to limit the places of residence of convicted sex offenders nineteen states and hundreds if not thousands of local communities have adopted statutes which severely limit the places where a sex offender may legally live in this article i trace these new laws to historical practices of banishment in western societies i argue that the establishment of exclusion zones by states and localities is a form of banishment that i have termed internal exile establishing the connection to banishment punishments helps to explain the unique legal policy and ethical problems these laws create for america ultimately residency restrictions could fundamentally alter basic principles of the american criminal justice system while those supporting these laws have the interests of children at heart the policies they are promoting will be worse for children and society
5393551 the us has often been imperiled by the competing interests of individual states and while past threats have most frequently assumed economic or political form this article addresses a different threat state efforts to limit where ex offenders those convicted of sex crimes in particular can live

5393553 this paper examines current research on the effectiveness of electronic monitoring and residential restrictions in preventing recidivism amongst sex offenders in california as well as the experiences of other states that have experimented with these techniques the paper focuses on four questions 1 what are the trends in california sex offense data and other states with sizable sex offender populations 2 what does research and other state experiences tell us about the effectiveness of electronic monitoring in preventing recidivism and absconding of sex offenders 3 what does research and other state experiences tell us about the effectiveness of residential restrictions in preventing recidivism of sex offenders 4 in light of californias sex offender population and cdcrs current methods for supervising paroled sex offenders what challenges would cdcr and other state agencies likely face in implementing expanded electronic monitoring and residential restrictions
5393554 in an effort to reduce sex offense recidivism local and state governments have recently passed legislation prohibiting sex offenders from living within a certain distance 500 to 2 500 feet of child congregation locations such as schools parks and daycare centers examining the potential deterrent effects of a residency restrictions law in minnesota this study analyzed the offense patterns of every sex offender released from minnesota correctional facilities between 1990 and 2002 who was reincarcerated for a new sex offense prior to 2006 given that not one of the 224 sex offenses would have likely been prevented by residency restrictions the findings from this study provide little support for the notion that such restrictions would significantly reduce sexual recidivism
5393555 given the wide range of issues that were presented by georgias latest sex offender residency restriction this note will discuss how georgias new residency restriction statute as originally written violated 1 the ex post facto clause 2 the eighth amendment 3 procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment and 4 the free exercise clause of the first amendment lastly the note will analyze potential issues under the dormant commerce clause and other policy considerations to argue that in practice the use of such harsh residency restrictions might make for a more dangerous situation for children sex offenders and the rest of society
5393556 a new trend in state legislation emerged as twenty two states entered legally unsettled waters by enacting various residency restrictions for convicted sex offenders legislators tout the need for such residency restrictions to reduce child sex offenders opportunities for contact with potential victims however courts disagree whether these new laws are constitutional and research increasingly questions their utility this comment will first look at the primary legal questions facing the courts examining various legal challenges to state residency restrictions and the limited research surrounding the efficacy of such restrictions next this comment will address the 2006 california ballot measure proposition 83 which serves as a practical case study of these new restrictions and their unsettled legal ramifications finally this comment will examine oregons nonmandatory residency restriction and explain why it serves as the best model for achieving the goals of protecting our children monitoring the sex offender population and withstanding judicial review ultimately this comment will attempt to show that research on mandatory residency restrictions may affect the way future courts rule on these restrictions this comment will also attempt to persuade those presently in favor of mandatory residency restrictions that more flexible nonmandatory restrictions will increase the likelihood of achieving their stated objectives
5393557 this article challenges prevailing judicial orthodoxy that many sex offender residency restrictions are constitutional under the federal ex post facto clause
5393558 the comment concludes that non tailored residency laws are unconstitutional these same laws are also unwise and ineffective in terms of their stated goals rendering them poor policy decisions given their ineffectiveness and the threat they pose to fundamental rights this part argues that it is important that courts assess the laws rigorously and without bias particularly because the political outlash against sex offenders is immense irrational and hard for legislators to reverse until courts correctly deem these non tailored residency laws unconstitutional both the rights of sex offenders and the safety of their potential victims will be at risk due to the crippling political outrage surrounding the issue
5393559 one of the most hotly debated issues in criminal law today is how to manage the perceived risk of sex offenders loose in the community
5393560 this article will look at why sex offenders are treated differently than other criminal offenders sex offenders are subject to sanctions and prohibitions above and beyond what other criminal offenders must face next the article will look at some of the residence and employment restrictions placed on sex offenders to determine if they are rationally related to any legitimate government interest without overbearing the sex offenders constitutional rights finally the article will offer an alternate means of sex offense prevention that encourages sex offender assimilation back into society instead of further exclusion
5393561 our article will focus on the adult family members of convicted sex offenders and the many challenges they face in reuniting with their loved ones post incarceration we will explore the general knowledge on families of prisoners and incorporate preliminary findings from our ongoing research on the experiences and needs of families of convicted adult male sex offenders
5393562 this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the current and pending sex offender legislation in california examine their effectiveness or ineffectiveness and any possible loopholes and conclude with a broad recommendation on where the state of californias law and policies surrounding the safe release and supervision of sex offenders into the community should be heading
5393563 although 22 states now have laws that restrict where sex offenders can live with 1 000 to 2 500 foot exclusionary zones being most common research on the effects of sex offender residence restrictions is limited only one study minnesota department of corrections 2007 has specifically examined the relationship between residence restrictions and reoffending that study was prospective because no such law was in place where the study was conducted minnesota there is a growing body of evidence however that residence restrictions have unintended consequences for sex offenders and communities these adverse effects include homelessness for sex offenders transience lack of accessibility to social support employment and rehabilitative services registry invalidity and the clustering of sex offenders in poor rural or socially disorganized neighborhoods residence laws are often based on erroneous assumptions about sex offender high reoffending rates and the belief that most sex offenders target strangers for victimization in addition they are rarely coupled with the administration of proven risk assessment instruments and procedures in the absence of evidence that residence restrictions are effective in achieving their intended goal of improved community safety their unintended adverse effects may outweigh their benefits it is crucial that research be conducted to determine whether residence restriction laws are effective
5393564 the inability of convicted sex offenders to find housing when they are released from prison has become a significant barrier to their successful reintegration into society this is particularly problematic for registrants who have limited resources or for those who because of work community or family obligations want to live in particular locations residency restrictions prevent offenders from living in the areas closest to jobs and public transit since schools daycare centers and parks are often built in the center of main residential areas of cities and towns
5393565 today some communities in the united states banish sex offenders from living in their midst resulting in a difficult dilemma where can these offenders live and where can they best be supervised and receive treatment if available this report describes local ordinances and state statutes restricting where a sex offender may reside discusses what research has found so far about the success of these restrictions considers the impact that these restrictions are having on criminal justice management practices and sex offender treatment regimens and examines constitutional implications
5393566 in an effort to curb the incidence of sexual recidivism state and local governments across the country have passed residency restriction laws designed to enhance public safety by protecting children residency restrictions prohibit sex offenders and in particular child molesters from living within a certain distance 500 to 2 500 feet of a school park playground or other location where children are known to congregate given that existing research has yet to fully investigate whether housing restrictions reduce sexual recidivism the present study examines the potential deterrent effect of residency restrictions by analyzing the sexual reoffense patterns of the 224 recidivists released between 1990 and 2002 who were reincarcerated for a sex crime prior to 2006

5393574 get over it because sewing can be way fun if you just relax a little
5393575 i went for mildly optimistic but i also think in addition to time one of the factors stopping teens making their own clothes as a hobby is money for that market you can get great cheap designer clothes at target h amp m zara etc why bother spending more and making something which as a beginner may not be as good
5393576 i am mildly concerned judging by my 18 year old daughter and her friends no one is interested in sewing but then few of the teens i know have any hobbies whatsoever other than facebook i hope that trend changes
5393577 i am hopeful that more and more young people will take up sewing either as a way to express their creativity or as a relaxing hobby when i hear from editors at national magazines that their average reader is 58 years old it makes me wonder what the future holds but then i see sites like etsy and threadbanger and my hope increases

5393603 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes that you can do these things among them are a few texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
5393604 across the country diesel powered generators are used in buildings like hospitals and trading houses where avoiding power outages is crucial partly for that reason a definitive understanding of what happened in 7 world trade center is vital to investigators said jonathan barnett a professor of fire protection engineering at the worcester polytechnic institute
5393605 nist reviewed the report of an environmental contractor hired in the months after the collapse of wtc 7 to recover remaining fuel and mitigate any environmental damage from the second systems two 6 000 gal tanks the tanks were damaged and appeared to be empty and the report stated that neither the underground storage tanks nor their associated piping contained any residual petroleum product no residual free product or sludge was observed in either underground storage tank evidence suggests that this fuel did not leak into the underground soil and contaminate it and therefore could have been consumed in the building
5393606 based on the available documentation the pressurized loop could have endlessly discharged fuel out of a broken fos pipe a break in the fos pipe between the pump set and fos valve rig could have activated the pump set in the event of a fos pipe break the fuel could have emptied out of the valve rig sending a low level signal to the pump controllers from the liquid level switch and starting the pump set fuel would have flowed out the break until the storage tank s were emptied however if the double walled construction of the fos piping was designed similar to that of the base building system it could have been possible that a leak detector switch would have shut off the pump set this cannot be determined from the available documentation the electrical characteristics of the system are unknown and need to be analyzed to determine if an electrical malfunction would have started or stopped the fuel pump set
5393607 the unfortunate thing is that in many parts of the world in many conflicts it has been made a weapon of war
5393608 its meant to tear societies apart its meant to show whos boss and i remember very well going to darfur and sitting in a refugee camp in a tent with women talking about the fact that they had been raped on the way to get firewood or to get water
5393609 reached unspeakable and pandemic proportions in some societies attempting to recover from conflict
5393610 they die in terms of their persona from then on and its really one of the worst things that you can do to a village or to its women
5393611 it has probably become more dangerous to be a woman than a soldier in an armed conflict
5393612 in some parts of the world thats absolutely true because of course the women are unarmed and theyre vulnerable
5393613 its been an unfortunate circumstance in some cases that its been peacekeepers that have turned on these women and so i felt very strongly that we needed to raise the profile of this issue
5393614 every day i was raped sometimes up to 10 times a day
5393615 it takes enormous courage because its a matter of great shame
5393616 there was a sense that this was the kind of crime that was committed with impunity
5393617 if people think that they can get away with it if they think that its not taken as seriously as some other kind of crime against humanity then its not going to be punished and its not going to be deterred

5393637 we heard reports all day long of 7 world trade possibly coming down we heard that all day long all the warnings
5393638 much of what happened to me on september 11 is a blur but this moment i clearly remember it was 4 45 p m and all the firemen and rescue workers were evacuating ground zero after word came that a third building wtc 7 was ready to fall
5393639 keep your eye on that building itll be coming down soon
5393640 what are you crazy youve moved into the collapse zone and if this collapse occurs the dust cloud is going to knock out that entire park youre going to be useless there youve made it worse
5393641 then we were just hanging out watching building 7 ready to go
5393642 basically a lost cause and we should not lose anyone else trying to save it
5393643 we were asked to go out of that area due to a risk of collapse in 7 wtc
5393644 the three of us along with 2 firemen searched that area until we were told to leave due to 7 possibly collapsing
5393645 hey lets just back everything off here because this building is coming down
5393646 what happened with that particular triage site is that pretty soon after noon after midday on 9 11 we had to evacuate that because they told us building 7 was coming down i do believe that they brought building 7 down because i heard that they were going to bring it down because it was unstable because of the collateral damage by noon or one oclock they told us we had to move from that triage site up to pace university a little further away because building 7 was gonna come down or being brought down there was another panic around four oclock because they were bringing the building down and people seemed to know this ahead of time so people were panicking again and running
5393647 and at that point they were worried that 7 was coming down so they were calling for everyone to back out
5393648 we no sooner got going on something there when a chief came along and said everybodys got to leave the area were afraid that seven world trade is going to fall down susan hagen and mary carouba women at ground zero 2002 p 213
5393649 after being ordered back because of the fear that yet another building was about to collapse 7 world trade center 40 stories brenda berkman and her crew went to find other firefighters who might have some tools or a radio that afternoon 7 world trade center came down
5393650 about an hour ago world trade center building number 7 collapsed it was the one calamity that was not a surprise police had evacuated the area hours ago fearful building number 7 would indeed fall down
5393651 about 4 30 p m word went out to evacuate the area officials were worried that building 7 of the trade center complex would collapse
5393652 hours later i sat down beside another impossibly weary firefighter then almost as a non sequitur the fireman indicated the building in front of us maybe 400 yards away that building is coming down he said with a drained casualness really i asked at 47 stories it would be a skyscraper in most cities centerpiece of the horizon but in new york it was nothing but a nondescript box with fire coming out of the windows when tonight maybe tomorrow morning this was around 5 15 p m i know because five minutes later at 5 20 the building 7 world trade center crumbled
5393653 then a policeman directed me north the solomon smith barney building building seven was about to collapse
5393654 seven or eight blocks down greenwich street the no 7 world trade building a smaller forty story structure was on fire the street was closed the building was going to collapse
5393655 yes i watched 7 at one point we were standing on the west side of west street and vesey and i remember chief nigro coming back at that point saying i dont want anybody else killed and to take everybody two blocks up virtually to north end and vesey which is a good ways up and we stood there and we watched 7 collapse
5393656 they started evacuating the area because they thought a third building was going to go down we decided to stay we saw the third building crash
5393657 i saw hundreds of firefighters leaning against buildings sitting on trucks eating fruit and water that the red cross was handing out where are all the injured i asked they are not letting us in its not stable said the firefighters all of a sudden seven world trade center started to collapse
5393658 the other building 7 was fully involved and he was worried about the next collapse
5393659 my biggest concern at the time was 7 it was burning and i felt that was a danger to the rescuers and to any trapped survivors there might be
5393660 we still had 7 world trade center which was burning also we were worried about that collapsing and it did collapse about six hours later there was a conscious decision to let that building burn and just keep everybody clear

5393699 the q400 pf aircraft will fill a gap because there is no other turboprop in the freight business that offers a 360 knot 667 km h speed and can comfortably fly more than the 700 nautical miles 1 296 km required for our operations
5393700 based on current fuel prices the q400 pf aircraft will save us approximately us 1 8 million based on an annual utilization of 1 200 hours compared to a jet of similar size air navigation and weight related charges are also anticipated to be 30 per cent less than those faced by the jet
5393701 nord flyg is convinced that the q400 pf aircraft will be welcomed by the industry because of its ability to perform at jet like speeds on both long and short haul route segments

5393827 both pc magazine and cnets download com have given this firewall high rating for effectiveness because we developed this solution to prevent malware from damaging a pc in the first place since its launch less than 60 days ago so many everyday users are embracing this solution that we are in effect protecting a small city every day this solution is part of our overall strategic focus to deliver a trusted internet where the merchant customer interaction space can be secured and authenticated at comodo we are working to deliver this level of trust to the online world
5393828 great here is the contract that we have drawn up for you
5393829 okay well just insert this little clause here that says that if this good feeling ever goes away well take your company for half of its worth but you dont have to worry about that
5393830 right message to the right person at the right time
5393831 that device will be used for volume control so theres not really any need for volume control on the source in other words its the same reason that the toslink output of a blu ray player etc doesnt have a volume control
5393832 at comodo we have changed the model of how users pc are protected
5393833 today we deliver prevention based security by only granting access to applications that we know to be trusted this model is unique and mitigates threats because we are not trying to identify malware per se as it is constantly changing rather we built technology to enable the system to know what can be trusted this avoids potentially damaging applications from ever being in a position to harm computers thats how pc can remain free from malware and we are ones to deliver this level of technological innovation for free
5393834 partners and peers sexual and dating violence among nyc youth
5393835 we know the long term adverse consequences on physical and emotional ill health from partner violence among youth it is essential that new york city address this problem with a multi faceted strategy
5393836 these data highlight the need for early identification treatment as well as prevention
5393837 unfortunately funding for relationship violence among youth is not a priority funds need to be made available at the city state and federal levels in order to promote sound intervention and prevention strategies for youth
5393838 new york citys young people are subject to sexual and dating violence at rates far higher than national average according to this study
5393839 these are alarming statistics any way you look at them and we are hopeful that these findings will highlight an issue that has been kept in the shadows for far too long and encourage more young people to seek help when they are victimized we are grateful to the new york city council for funding this landmark study and to the new york city department of education for its courage in allowing such a research project to take place in city schools the cooperation we received from the four school principals the teachers the parents and from the students was unprecedented

5393845 my bus has been shot at and the bullet was so close you could hear it ricocheting off the bus
5393846 it can be a simple change made in the law which says if you have any cases involving an assault where there are stitches that should be assault in the third degree
5393847 once you have that threshold then we can then prosecute those who attack transit workers and cops with the felony
5393848 there were 146 assaults on bus operators resulting in lost time 27 assaults on conductors resulting in lost time eight assaults on station agents resulting lost time and four assaults on train operators

5393850 over the past billions of years nature has already generated on earth as many collisions as about a million lhc experiments and the planet still exists
5393851 there is no basis for any concerns about the consequences of new particles or forms of matter that could possibly be produced by the lhc
5393852 if microscopic black holes were to be singly produced by colliding the quarks and gluons inside protons they would also be able to decay into the same types of particles that produced them
5393853 the expected lifetime of a mini black hole would be very short

5393859 i have my views and you have yours as long as we both repect our differences and respect everybodys human rights then we can coexist peacefully
5393860 we regret that formal consultations have not beensuccessful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the euis imposing on several high tech products
5393861 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the euscommitments on these products and that they discouragetechnological innovation in the it sector
5393862 do you want some more do you want us to do another one
5393863 so hsbcs decision to increase the cash withdrawal fee for card use abroad perhaps isnt necessarily a surprise obviously it will impact the consumer with millions of us travelling overseas in the coming weeks people could well be caught out by this fee
5393864 for the people that we have been meeting going door to door neighborhood to neighborhood change is not just a slogan it means hope it makes you proud to be doing your part

5393870 one key element of a trusted internet requires computers that can be trusted to be virus and malware free this cnet recognition confirms our commitment to innovate in creating a trusted internet is a much needed advancement in the industry
5393871 i remember buying one of those surgical masks it was like a way scary time to be alive

5393873 yesterday was kind of rough but todays going to be a better day
5393874 its funny because the firefighters took all my guitars put them on my bed and covered them
5393875 so theyre ok but the water pretty much did us in everywhere else
5393876 that style roof when it gets into that roof it runs
5393877 you can see how far it went and how fast it got going
5393878 i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street
5393879 i understand why some people feel angry not just over iraq but many of the difficult decisions we have made
5393880 its a fight for the future of our country its a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win
5393881 depress our vote and get out theirs with a hard right agenda
5393882 today we heard more of the same from tony blair
5393883 he wants people to believe that he now has the answers to the problems britain faces but people know that its just more talk
5393884 this was another classic blair speech which was very touchy feely but i suspect the public have heard too many of these speeches now and what they will remember is the question of trust
5393885 i learnt that when im working hard doing my damnedest and wondering frustrated why people cant appreciate the delivery its so easy to forget life is still so tough for so many people a real life daily struggle not for a life of luxury but just to get by
5393886 instead of hating the people you think are the warmakers hate the appetites and the disorder in your own soul which are the causes of war if you love peace then hate injustice hate tyranny hate greed but hate these things in yourself not in another
5393887 we thought it was an expensive holiday to start with but then of course with everything going up so much over the last 12 months we found it more and more difficult to rake the money together we were going to have to dip into savings to meet the cost so the extra 900 was just a bitter blow
5393888 i was quite shocked when i came up with how close the whole thing is to below 10 i have to say that when you look at everything they have not broken any rules but it makes it look contrived
5393889 we are not in any way profiteering from our customers rather the opposite
5393890 the incredible and anticipated increase in fuel costs has caused us much heartache and worry

5393897 that doesnt mean that they wont raise their bid but this shows that microsoft is in the drivers seat
5393898 there clearly are some shareholders that are a bit conflicted
5393899 microsoft wants this very badly to happen and they want it to happen on a friendly basis on a somewhat expeditious manner
5393900 i still think microsoft is likely to raise its bid a little bit
5393901 if that stock goes back to 20 thats a worst case scenario for yahoo shareholders
5393902 i want to say something that doesnt get said enough and doesnt get said enough to transit workers and that is thank you people come to new york and i meet them and they always talk about how great the city is how big it is and they ask how do you run a city this big with so many people around and i have three words our transit system

5393906 oh by the way thats another serious new development in inefficiency the personal servant syndrome where our leaders have their bags even briefcases carried by their employees and placed in the overhead storage units on the plane what are we thinking this is going back to feudal kingdom and colonial behavior and should be outlawed as soon as possible especially if the bag carriers are public servants

5393911 our decision to participate in the united nations global compact in 2007 confirms our belief that a strong commitment and a strategic approach to corporate responsibility are essential for managing the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing global environment
5393912 what we are talking about here is people who buy land
5393913 there is evidence that many travellers have come over from ireland where the laws are far more rigorous because they believe they can exploit the loopholes here
5393914 tapping into the biggest vein of bigotry prejudice against gypsies and travellers
5393915 michael howards bandwagon opportunism has led him into hypocrisy of new heights
5393916 as home secretary it was michael howard who did most to reduce the number of legal traveller sites
5393917 we call for positive public education about gypsy and traveller life and culture in which gypsy and traveller communities should also participate

5393923 each year the applicants come from more diverse backgrounds and we look forward to working with these students next summer at noaa
5393924 global water required online security to protect its customers as they perform online transactions with the company the importance of securing customer information and guaranteeing the security and integrity of online transactions cannot be underestimated
5393925 i assert that this glowing liquid metal is consistent with flowing liquid iron from a nearby thermite reaction zone
5393926 the yellow colour implies a molten metal temperature of approximately 1000 c
5393927 high temperature cutter charges such as thermite hmx or rdx or some combination thereof routinely used to melt cut demolish steel
5393928 are there any examples of buildings toppled by fires or any reason other than deliberate demolition that show large pools of molten metal in the rubble
5393929 it is highly unlikely that this sulfur could find its way into the structural steel in such a way as to form a eutectic
5393930 no major persistent fires were visible considerable dark smoke was seen
5393931 evidently none of the core columns was severed by falling debris
5393932 concrete floors in the twin towers and wtc7 were pulverized to dust as is common in controlled demolitions using explosives
5393933 steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated
5393934 what caused the 47 enormous steel core columns of this building which supported the antenna to evidently give way nearly simultaneously if not cutter charges
5393935 plausible and simple explanation for the observed detonations followed by complete building collapses
5393936 for very tall towers such as these top down demolition seems to be the best approach to avoid toppling over of the tower
5393937 core columns cannot pull the exterior columns in via the floor
5393938 the fires in the towers in september 11 and the resulting exposure of the floor systems were substantially different from the conditions in the test furnaces
5393939 serious concerns about the nist wtc collpase report raised by structural and fire engineers
5393940 regardless of how athletic you think you are some of the things that elites do can be very beneficial

5393942 ive been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but wont cover birth control medication those women would like a choice
5393943 i dont know enough about it to give you an informed answer because i dont recall the vote i dont usually duck an issue but ill try to get back to you
5393944 for greater variety and competition allowing women to choose policies that fit their needs an example is the choice for women to dump a policy that only covers viagra for a policy that covers their real needs
5393945 the point is basically that carbon dioxide is still a very good treatment it does have a down time and some side effects but it does cause a dramatic improvement in many patients that we cant achieve with anything else out there now
5393946 theres nothing earth shattering about this paper except the fairly long term follow up it just confirms that carbon dioxide laser resurfacing is very effective for deeper facial wrinkles and its long lasting
5393947 then it removes the epidermis top layer of the skin and dermis middle layer of the skin it also causes contraction or tightening of the skin
5393948 the biggest problem with co2 is lightening of the skin essentially all of our patients got lightening to some degree but a certain percentage got marked lightening where you could see quite a bit of difference on photographs
5393949 thats the cost of getting rid of wrinkles permanently or near permanently
5393950 part of it has to do with how aggressive you are with peeling
5393951 if there are more wrinkles you have to do more energy levels and you often do more than two or three passes so the patients are going to get more lightening the deeper you go the more lightening you are going to get

5393971 barack obama is a good and inspiring man but who is he other than a guy who gives a great speech how much do any of us really know about him i know he was against the war how do i know that he gave a speech before the war started but since he joined the senate he has voted for the funds for the war while at the same time saying we should get out he says hes for the little guy but then he votes for a corporate backed bill to make it harder for the little guy to file a class action suit when his kid swallows lead paint from a chinese made toy in fact obama doesnt think wall street is a bad place he wants the insurance companies to help us develop a new health care plan the same companies who have created the mess in the first place hes such a feel good kinda guy i get the sense that if elected the republicans will eat him for breakfast he wont even have time to make a good speech about it

5393977 alexandria accounts for about 40 percent of egypt s industrial production and this results in serious pollution of the lake he said the two waste water treatment plants did not have the capacity to treat all the sewage and other effluent he said
5393978 two thirds of the city s waste water is released into the lake and subsequently pumped into mex bay west of alexandria he said adding that further pollution was caused by chemical runoff due to nearby agricultural activity
5393979 these plants hinder fishing reduce oxygen levels in the water and hamper fish breeding he said al alfi said the fa had been suggesting solutions since 1999 but had had no response from the government we cant understand why they refuse to save the lake
5393980 filling activities started a long time ago causing the lake to lose most of its area today its area is 17 000 acres in 1889 it was 60 000 acres these days the pace of infill is quickening the governorate is planning to build new alexandria city on 1 000 feddans a feddan is slightly larger than an acre of the lake a project which has been suspended because of our fierce opposition
5393981 we will resort to all measures to stop the filling of this basin even if we have to go to court they can build such projects in the desert but not on the lake which provides biological balance in the area

5393991 whether its down to the drop in interest rates and the stockmarket they should still have paid me at the date that i asked surely
5393992 if someone has actually incurred delay and in consequence of that delay has suffered financial loss because their pension pot has dropped from the date when they should have got it to the date they actually are going to get it then they will have certainly a claim for compensation on the grounds of financial loss
5393993 everybody who has suffered a loss and that has been brought to our attention obviously were investigating these proactively as well will be compensated

5394010 a better way to understand leverage is to think about which side at any given moment has the most to lose from a failure to agree
5394011 leverage often flows to the party that exerts the greatest control over and appears most comfortable with the present situation
5394012 to gain real leverage you must eventually persuade the other party that he or she has something concrete to lose in the transaction if the deal falls through
5394013 negative leverage threat leverage that gets peoples attention because potential losses loom larger in the human mind than do equivalent gains
5394014 normative leverage normative leverage is the ability to apply general norms or your opponents standards and norms to advance your position
5394015 this way of thinking about leverage also points to more sophisticated ways of enhancing your leverage that go beyond just improving your batna your goal is to alter the situation or at least the other partys perception of the situation so you have less to lose the other side has more to lose or both
5394016 because you dont want to make yourself vulnerable i dont know what happened to you if people were mean to you when you were young but you have to move past that by not committing you are missing out on all these relationships some even with your own family its your family you need to commit

5394044 karl rove has no recollection of ever saying that rep steve kagen was the number 1 candidate to beat in 2008 perhaps his recollection of karl saying this is as vivid and wrong as that of his first visit to the white house

5394091 when the building came down it was completely involved in fire all forty seven stories
5394092 we walked over by number seven world trade center as it was burning and saw this 40 plus story building with fire on nearly all floors
5394093 just when you thought it was over youre walking by this building and youre hearing this building creak and fully involved in flames its like is it coming down next sure enough about a half an hour later it came down
5394094 fires were random not particularly large and certainly not an inferno
5394095 here in this photo you see the fires in building 7 a close up and you see a little bit of fire in there not much
5394096 now here are photos seen in the late afternoon not a lot of fire here or damage
5394097 byu has repeatedly said that it does not endorse assertions made by individual faculty we are however concerned about the increasingly speculative and accusatory nature of these statements by dr jones byu remains concerned that dr jones work on this topic has not been published in appropriate scientific venues it is a concern when faculty bring the university name into their own personal matters of concern
5394098 what this means is that jones is perfectly willing to lie about credentials to pad the roles of st911 and fetzer is perfectly willing to accommodate those lies even af ter he has been informed in no uncertain terms that that is exactly what they are this puts in stark relief the noteworthy lack of integrity that informs the work of st911 that is if there is not even an intention to maintain integrity in the membership roles how can anyone trust there is integrity anywhere else as i have said more than once scholars for 9 11 truth cannot succeed when founded on a pack of lies
5394099 the strongest piece of evidence i would have to say would be the collapse of world trade center building 7 this was a 47 story office building 300 feet away from the north tower at 5 20 p m on september 11th this building fell straight down into its own footprint in six seconds which if you do the math is basically in absolute free fall
5394100 i mean this was a controlled demolition i mean theres no way of avoiding it i mean the simple fact is how could al qaeda or anybody else have rigged building 7 for controlled demolition which is a process that takes months of planning
5394101 barely even in the damage range it wasnt hit by a substantial amount of debris
5394102 galileos law of falling bodies building 7 the pentagon basically the obvious physical and scientific evidence that nobody can refute
5394103 what is the objective to be accomplished by placing bombs in the towers other than a complete collapse if plane impacts are sufficient to be considered an attack on america the justification for war
5394104 well supposedly those bombs werent there according to the official version there was never any charges placed inside the world trade center and its a question of why they would they be in there and why you would want to bring down the world trade center themselves i mean the world trade center was built in 1973 with asbestos and other dangerous materials that arent allowed in todays building world i mean they received numerous citations to clean up the buildings and to clean up those materials would have cost over a billion dollars so i mean yes running planes into the buildings would have been sufficient enough as an attack but it wasnt the overall goal of larry a silverstein who owned wtc building 7 and leased the rest of the buildings it wasnt enough for him i mean now hes got prime real estate in downtown manhattan and after a 220 million investment turned into a two billion dollar profit
5394105 the 9 11 commission for example was so blown away by building 7 they dont even mention it in their report

5394141 it is fitting to release the draft management plan for the nations largest conservation area on earth day
5394142 i am especially pleased to offer the many supporters of papah naumoku kea the opportunity to assist us in crafting the future of the monument by sharing their manao this vast area has a great deal of significance not only to those concerned with protecting our environment but to the native hawaiians who share such a strong cultural tie to the northwestern hawaiian islands
5394143 as we near the 100th anniversary of the creation of the hawaiian islands national wildlife refuge and actually celebrate the 20th anniversary of midway atoll national wildlife refuge on this very day we reaffirm the wisdom of our ancestors in protecting this very special region
5394144 from the early polynesians who first visited these islands to todays visitors to midway atoll we share a sense of wonder over the remarkable wildlife who call papah naumoku kea home through this management plan we hope to continue protecting and restoring their habitats so that future generations may also view them with awe
5394145 the draft plan truly embodies the spirit of cooperative conservation
5394146 the document reflects the best thinking of thousands of people who have raised their voices on behalf of the monument we look forward to working with the community and our fellow monument co trustees to ensure the protection of this special and globally significant place that is papah naumoku kea

5394161 thus did the central deception of the whole story become established from now on the real agenda political integration was to be deliberately concealed under the guise of economic integration building europe was to be presented as a matter of trade and jobs
5394162 to ensure a regular injection of creative energy into the various efforts related to north american integration the three governments should appoint an independent body of advisers this body should be composed of eminent persons from outside government appointed to staggered multiyear terms to ensure their independence their mandate would be to engage in creative exploration of new ideas from a north american perspective and to provide a public voice for north america a complementary approach would be to establish private bodies that would meet regularly or annually to buttress north american relationships along the lines of the bilderberg

5394164 i think one thing for people who are dollar based need to focus on is the amero thats the one thing that nobody is talking about that i think is going to have a big impact on everybodys life in canada the u s and mexico
5394165 thirty years from now americans japanese europeans and people in many other rich countries and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency
5394166 the phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments there would be no such thing for instance as a national monetary policy the world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank descended perhaps from the imf the world inflation rate and hence within narrow margins each national inflation rate would be in its charge each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit with no recourse to the inflation tax governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today this means a big loss of economic sovereignty but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case even in a world of more or less floating exchange rates individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world
5394167 pencil in the phoenix for around 2018 and welcome it when it comes
5394168 with the emergence of the euro and its instability against the dollar europe the united states and the asian powers should come together and create a new international monetary system
5394169 the house of world order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down it will look like a great booming buzzing confusion to use william james famous description of reality but an end run around national sovereignty eroding it piece by piece will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault

5394179 avic i signed a strategic cooperation agreement with bombardier in april 2007 avic i attaches great importance to and supports the cseries project and is willing to participate in this project as a risk sharing supplier two days ago bombardier officially announced the launch of the cseries program today we are here signing the contract in which avic i sac will take part in the design manufacture assembly and relevant testing as well as after market support of four major work packages for the cseries aircraft i am confident that the cooperation between avic i and bombardier will further promote the development of the commercial aircraft business of our two companies and contribute to the development of the global aviation industry
5394180 shenyang has a long and proud history as an industrial base in china and we place aerospace as one of our key priorities
5394181 the goal of the shenyang national aviation and high tech industrial base our industrial hub dedicated to the high tech aerospace sector is to be chinas largest single site for final assembly of regional jets business jets light aircraft and jet engines on the occasion of this announcement between bombardier aerospace and avic i we are pleased to offer our support to avic i as it invests in a new facility in shenyang for its subsidiary company sac
5394182 last year when we announced the mou between avic i and bombardier aerospace we were confident of the long term benefits to both companies with the official announcement of the launch of the bombardier cseries aircraft program the signing of this contract with sac as a major structural supplier for our cseries aircraft program is further evidence that this collaborative partnership was the right choice
5394183 together we will expand upon this supplier relationship and build a new long term strategic cooperation that will allow us to reap the benefits of working together on products that will more than meet the needs of the marketplace
5394184 this is good news for everyone involved our bombardier cseries aircraft is a true game changer and with the signing of this contract with sac we now have a major supplier for the aircrafts center fuselage
5394185 featuring the latest in system technologies and aerodynamics the five abreast cseries aircraft family is specifically designed to meet the growing needs of the 100 to 149 seat mainline commercial airliner market which is estimated at 6 300 aircraft over the next 20 years we expect to be able to capture up to half of this market

5394190 what really makes this book is the often entertaining picture it paints of the tribulations of trying to run a business much of silvermans time before the catastrophe seems to be spent in meetings that are hijacked by the competing interests of those present it is no wonder that at least one business school is making it mandatory reading for anyone considering starting their own business

5394196 i had a clear view down washington street of building seven which was on the north edge of the site
5394197 we were down about a block from the base of the world trade center towers about an hour ago and there was a great deal of concern at that time the firemen said building number 7 was going to collapse building number five was in danger of collapsing and theres so little they can do to try to fight the fires in these buildings because the fires are so massive and so much of the buildings continues to fall into the street when youre down there dan you hear smaller secondary explosions going off every 15 or 20 minutes and so its an extremely dangerous place to be
5394198 get out of here get out of here get out of here weve got to go weve got to go its going to collapse
5394199 stay in the frigging car roll the windows up its pancake collapsing well be fine the debris will quit and the cloud will come through just stay in the car
5394200 hey jerry dont try and get back out the way you went in which was big heads up move because
5394201 we have a six story building over there a seven story building fully involved
5394202 weve got a ten story over there another ten story over there a six story over there a 13 story over there
5394203 just tell the guys to keep looking for guys just keep looking for the brothers weve got people trapped weve got to get them out
5394204 from outside this zone you could figure out where everything was
5394205 but inside it was all destruction and blown out buildings and we had no clue i walked into one building but i had no idea where i was the windows were all blown out computers desks furniture and peoples possessions were strewn all over
5394206 there was nobody out no bodies no injured nobody there were mounds of burning debris it was like opening a broiler
5394207 when i got out and onto a clear pile i see that 7 world trade center and the customs house have serious fire
5394208 the other building 7 was fully involved and he was worried about the next collapse
5394209 propaganda groups do not have the capacity to lead workers in major struggles and recruit on that basis we are primarily arguing our ideas not agitating for mass action
5394210 we can play an important role in initiating some localised struggles and provide some of the key activists in a variety of campaign groups
5394211 a high degree of political demarcation from those on the left who dont agree with any aspect of marxism
5394212 the necessity of maintaining a strict political separation between the marxists own organisation and those of their rivals on the left
5394213 look to the regimes in vietnam china north korea or cuba
5394214 answer the central political question what do we do next
5394215 there has been no organised political vanguard in any meaningful sense since the 1970s nor are there ongoing campaigns that we can relate to that are radicalising and organising into activity significant bodies of people
5394216 have not led to the emergence of ongoing organised movements
5394217 small minority among students can carry out meaningful activity hold a lively protest or occupation or initiate a campaign small groups of socialists can realistically play a leading role and be taken more seriously
5394218 have to be able to argue a strategy for winning the struggle to put forward concrete proposals they have to draw out the lessons to point out the role of the police the media
5394219 a propaganda group must be able to link the particular issue to broader questions such as the capitalists neo liberal agenda the nature of imperialism
5394220 can develop ways of doing things which might seem strange to some blue collar workers
5394221 marxists whose touchstone is the self emancipation of the working class
5394222 historians call this movement spontaneous in the conditional sense that no party took the initiative in it
5394223 it is customary to say that the movement began spontaneously the soldiers themselves went into the street i cannot at all agree with this after all what does the word spontaneously mean spontaneous conception is still more out of place in sociology than in natural science owing to the fact that none of the revolutionary leaders with a name was able to hang his label on the movement it becomes not impersonal but merely nameless
5394224 to the question who led the february revolution we can then answer definitely enough conscious and tempered workers educated for the most part by the party of lenin
5394225 it isnt worthwhile because theres no one else moving on this issue that we can work with to build a broader campaign it would just be us substituting for such a genuine campaign
5394226 we dont think we will recruit anyone by getting involved in that campaign
5394227 between the hopes and aspirations of millions of working people and the agenda of the ruling capitalist establishment and its parties
5394228 organised reformism is not simply based on parties like the alp but even more importantly on the trade union bureaucracy
5394229 the final goal no matter what it is is nothing the movement is everything
5394230 the movement no matter what it is about is nothing the final goal is everything
5394231 between social reforms and revolution there exists for the social democracy an indissoluble tie the struggle for reforms is its means the social revolution its aim

5394236 this guy practices the occult he had to in order to get into skull amp bones the not so secret yale university club whose membership rolls were published by the school when kerry was a member what else is he capable of
5394237 and the 9 11 attack itself is that the european group or is that more the americans like bush and cheney
5394238 these guys in america are able to become billionaires but theyre not the multi trillionaires that are in countries basically with a free license to print money so their power the americans power can only go so far
5394239 so you see it the people behind the 9 11 attacks as more of a european type thing
5394240 absolutely i mean when you look at how bizarre some of these rituals are and where these things come from helmut schmidt for instance former german chancellor talks about all the things he used to do all these germanic death cults and he talks about you know bohemian grove being a sex event and loving the rituals there its suspicious to me man i mean i can see that with my own eyes i would like to read his eyewitness accounts mr you look at things like the montauk project and boys town and they definitely used you know drug addicts sexual deviants its mind control its absolute mind control
5394241 there was a report out in the past couple of days on alex jones website of course that the government has been actually recruiting pastors and ministers to go around and say you know if something like the bird flu hits itll be good to go with like fema into camps and all these other federally regulated areas and theyre actually being paid to say this stuff and taking inoculations and that is scary
5394242 unfortunately in this country if there is another major event and if it is incrementalized and larger than the last one they could declare martial law at any moment and have forced inocu lations and whos to say what they put in your body
5394243 believe it or not tivo was working on a brain chip so that with your tivo box there it would record what you want when you want it and it will base it on your brain patterns
5394244 you can just imagine just the flurry of people who are going to be here in memoriam of all those that died on september 11th really were gearing up were giving out 10 000 dvds weve got 1 100 shirts were really gonna make our presence known finally the mainstream media is going to have to stop attacking us and start reporting on us fairly and thats really our goal
5394245 and shame on the mainstream media in general for participating in what can only be de scribed as a media blackout those that did mention it marginalized it dramatically we are not conspiracy theorists by any stretch we are a growing body of concerned americans who have both investigated the events and experienced them first hand and we are absolutely convinced that our government is hid ing the truth from us whatever the truth may be
5394246 i find it extremely telling that this article from mexico gives us more coverage of 9 11 than anything we experienced from american mainstream media combined
5394247 i challenge a 9 11 truth leader like loose change writer dylan avery to come up with a detailed complete summary of the alleged plot not the bits and pieces but the whole story put together that would not make any fifth grader anywhere burst out in convulsive laughter

5394258 human outpourings of greenhouse gases have flicked the switch that turns the world from its colder to its warm state and it is probably too late to stop it
5394259 the warming impact of the carbon we have already released is such that the earth has taken over and our greenhouse gas emissions are being amplified by nature itself
5394260 i have just come back from norway where the temperatures are even further above normal than britains the climate is changing every year now everyone can see it as in this very warm april by mid century the heatwave in europe that killed 20 000 people in 2003 will be a cool summer by comparison
5394261 the progressive acidification of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell forming organisms ie corals and their dependent species
5394262 at lower latitudes especially seasonally dry and tropical regions crop productivity is projected to decrease for even small local temperature increases 1 2c which would increase risk of hunger
5394263 the world will face mass shortages of food and water that will lead to wars and the effective clearance of vast areas of land as the deserts spread
5394264 britain and scandinavia are becoming green oases in 2050 or soon after most of the world may be scrub and desert and most of the oceans will be denuded of life but temperatures here will remain very tolerable the downside of that is that we risk becoming like a lifeboat with millions of refugees trying to settle here

5394275 the unprecedented collapse of the salmon population will hit fishermen their families and fishing communities hard and that is why we have moved quickly to declare a fishery disaster
5394276 our scientists are working to better understand the effects that ocean changes have on salmon populations we are also working closely with fishing communities to improve salmon habitat in river systems to support sustainable fishing
5394277 this is far below what is needed to sustain the population and we have decided to shut down the commercial ocean salmon fishery for all of california and most of oregon to aid their recovery
5394278 its a tough decision but the condition of the salmon fishery forces us to close most of it to ensure healthy runs of this valuable fish in the future

5394286 with four daily flights to luxembourg locating the pool in frankfurt is very convenient as it will provide us rapid access to parts in case of an aircraft on ground aog this is very reassuring as it allows us to optimize the q400 aircraft operations as frankfurt offers similar connections all over europe other bombardier customers will be able to take advantage of this pool in the future

5394290 i said that damiano cunego is a little real champion but he needs to be patient and not so foolhardy
5394291 you look at him and wonder how he gets stuff done hes so relaxed but hes showed hes got what it takes to win the tour de france
5394292 it remains to be seen what he goes on to do but i have no doubt that popo is a future tour winner
5394293 jan remains one of the best riders around and next year you can be sure hell be leading the chase for the win

5394299 the fall in international prices is a relief but the companies are still losing money and we dont see a reduction in retail prices happening till they continue to suffer losses
5394300 it fall in crude prices is a happy sign it is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic retail prices
5394301 there still are huge under recoveries on fuel sales i dont see how we can reduce retail prices when our companies continue to lose money

5394319 pharmacists are health professionals who assist individuals in making the best use of medications
5394320 this medication is used to help prevent pregnancy in women who have had unprotected sex intercourse or suspect a failure in their current form of birth control e g broken condom it is not intended to be used for routine birth control and will not stop an existing pregnancy abortion
5394321 we dont feel bad that people in the delta cant have an abortion
5394322 to say that we want to be sure that poor women can get their abortions like were doing them a favor by helping them kill their baby is just not ok with me

5394327 this is a consultation and we welcome ideas about the proposals
5394328 we would welcome the general principle that more coursework be assessed as part of the overall examination system
5394329 the difficulty we have is that if the work that is done is a kind of project based work where much of it is being done outside of the school then there is a potential difficulty in verifying that the work is in fact that of the pupils themselves
5394330 we would prefer to see any internal assessment being done literally inside the school so that the work is being verified by teachers and they can attest to the fact it is the work of the pupils
5394331 there are a range of assessment techniques which can be used to make that happen
5394332 the consultation paper clearly states that external exams will be retained at all levels where they are currently used for certification
5394333 however we believe that there may be scope for making better use of different types of assessment alongside external exams depending upon the individual nature of each course

5394364 leaders of the conservative wing of the church have worked since at least the 1990s to develop international alliances
5394365 it was supposed to be a classic piece of anglican fudge but it was hijacked by a lobby of bishops from the developing world which had formed in the mid 1990s resolving to contest anglicanisms drift to the condoning of homosexuality
5394366 is the total integration of biblical law into our lives
5394367 said he no longer thought it was necessary to stone homosexuals but that if you came upon a society that was living by the laws of ancient where they did stone homosexuals you couldnt say that that was necessarily immoral and that was the softening of his view
5394368 but the fact is that much of the money comes from the west the statements are written almost exclusively in the west or by westerners
5394369 what just happened in jerusalem is that bishops from some of the poorest countries on the planet got together for a meeting to make a great contribution to the church and what emerged was a document that did nothing to improve the life of the average african but did much to advance the interests of wealthy americans australians and people in the united kingdom

5394381 iran is holding up the water from two rivers al wan and serwan which flow through iran to iraq s southeastern province of diyala by building dams on them
5394382 we are expecting to lose nearly half of our water resources or maybe more than 50 percent if neighbouring countries continue building dams on the rivers tigris and euphrates
5394383 turkey and syria for their part are reducing water levels in both the tigris and the euphrates by doing the same as iran that could deprive at least one million hectares of iraqi agricultural land of water and threaten livelihoods in the marshlands

5394402 hi bonnie i just blogged about middlesex by jeffrey eugenides and wanted to add it to the challenge representing the usa because i feel the novel through its portrait of immigrants making their way in the new culture assimilating but at the same time holding onto old traditions tells us a lot about what is was like for so many millions of people who came to america i am very interested in genealogy and how it must have been for them the novel also gives us a view of a major american city detroit and the way it changed over the years through immigration poverty and racial tensions and finally what it was like to grow up in the 70s but i noticed there is no usa category on your blog yet

5394410 i really think that the tide is starting to turn against the riaa with the tainted stats then the questions of the calling bullshit on the 750
5394411 so successful are their continuing dis and misinformation propaganda campaigns that theyve been able to use them to dragoon entire governments and police forces into acting as industry enforcers
5394412 however the cartels are also frequently accused of fabricating statistics upon which they base their claims and according to the havocscope global index of illicit markets far from being at the top of the pile movie and music piracy are way way down the list ranking 16th and 20th respectively

5394471 ia menatap padaku selama beberapa detik tanpa bersuara kenyataannya ia percaya bahwa perceraian adalah sesuatu yang sangat jauh darinya ketika istriku mengunjungi kantorku dew baru saja keluar dari ruanganku hampir seluruh staff menatap istriku dengan mata penuh simpati dan berusaha untuk menyembunyikan segala sesuatu selama berbicara dengan ia ia kelihatan sedikit kecurigaan ia berusaha tersenyum pada bawahan bawahanku tapi aku membaca ada kelukaan di matanya sekali lagi dew berkata padaku

5394495 using the embolization of varicoceles we were able to improve factors related to infertility especially sperm count and sperm motility
5394496 if youre dealing with infertility and have varicoceles this should be treated
5394497 most of the time infertility is on both the male and female side
5394498 most of the time females get treated first if there is an issue and men are neglected i think you could boost the performance of the sperm if a varicocele is present and treated
5394499 the fact is that a male factor is responsible for infertility in about half of the cases
5394500 varicoceles are one example of the male factor that can affect fertility
5394501 i recommend in experienced hands a microsurgical varicocelectomy which is a very quick operation with minimal time off work

5394531 i have known michael savage for nine years now over those nine years we have had occasion to disagree on many issues however i have always respected michael as a man of conviction and i have noticed throughout our relationship that he has always been passionate and intense in his opposition to persons who he perceived to be disrespectful of persons dealing with special challenges i once asked him about his passion in this area and he noted that it was because he had a brother who was disabled but that he did not want to discuss it michael never shared any particulars on this with me until he shared with his audience on monday that his brother never spoke during his lifetime was institutionalized at 5 or 6 years old and died in that institution in his 20s my observations of michaels consistent opposition to what he viewed as abuse or disrespect of persons dealing with special challenges and of his interest in children as well as his 1982 book healing children naturally are completely inconsistent with michael attacking children who are truly autistic in contrast his belief that misdiagnosing children as autistic will damage those children who are misdiagnosed and stigmatize them for life his aversion to what he sees as improper medication of young children and subjecting them to a lifetime of chemical straight jackets and his recent sharing of his belief that the medical profession failed to properly care for his brother prior to his brothers death do explain his passion in challenging what he sees as improper efforts by some in the health care industry to brand and treat as autistic persons who are not

5394567 potentially face internet gridlock that could wreak havoc on internet services
5394568 the internet singularity delayed why limits in internet capacity will stifle innovation on the web
5394569 for example it may take more than one attempt to confirm an online purchase or it may take longer to download the latest video from youtube
5394570 overall the impact of this inadequate infrastructure will be primarily to slow down the pace of innovation the next amazon google or youtube might not arise not from a lack of user demand but because of insufficient infrastructure preventing applications and companies from emerging
5394571 these types of studies often boil down to pure posturing and polemic against net neutrality bought and paid for by at amp t when researchers stumble across inconvenient points such as the current boom in infrastructure investment they dismiss them in favour of doomsday scenarios and call for an end to the one rule that allows online users to innovate without permission

5394603 what does a reversion to barbarism mean at the present stage of european civilisation
5394604 the collapse of all civilization as in ancient rome depopulation desolation degeneration a great cemetery
5394605 the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles that each time ended either in the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes
5394606 humanity is facing the alternative dissolution and downfall in capitalist anarchy or regeneration through the social revolution
5394607 profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilisation that lies unveiled before our eyes turning from its home where it assumes respectable forms to the colonies where it goes naked
5394608 hideous pagan idol who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain
5394609 on the one hand there have started into life industrial and scientific forces which no epoch of the former human history had ever suspected on the other hand there exist symptoms of decay far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the roman empire
5394610 shamed dishonoured wading in blood and dripping in filth this capitalist society stands
5394611 a look around us at this moment shows what the regression of bourgeois society into barbarism means this world war is a regression into barbarism
5394612 the delay of the socialist revolution engenders the indubitable phenomena of barbarism chronic unemployment pauperization of the petty bourgeoisie fascism finally wars of extermination which do not open up any new road
5394613 the choice before humanity is socialism or barbarism when rosa luxemburg made this statement she was speaking of a relatively distant future but now the situation of the world is so bad that the threat to the human race is not in the future but now
5394614 i was remembering karl marx and rosa luxemburg and the phrase that each one of them in their particular time and context put forward the dilemma socialism or barbarism
5394615 i believe it is time that we take up with courage and clarity a political social collective and ideological offensive across the world a real offensive that permits us to move progressively over the next years the next decades leaving behind the perverse destructive destroyer capitalist model and go forward in constructing the socialist model to avoid barbarism and beyond that the annihilation of life on this planet
5394616 i believe this idea has a strong connection with reality
5394617 tomorrow could be too late lets do now what we need to do
5394618 a dystopic possible future world in which social problems are made much worse by the environmental consequences of rising greenhouse gas emissions
5394619 climate change is or could be the additional factor which will exacerbate the existing problems of poverty environmental degradation social polarisation and terrorism and it could lead to a very chaotic situation
5394620 a situation where the rich live in enclaves protected and the poor live outside in unsustainable conditions
5394621 ultimately climate change is a threat to humanity as a whole but it is the poor a constituency with no responsibility for the ecological debt we are running up who face the immediate and most severe human costs
5394622 while the citizens of the rich world are protected from harm the poor the vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh reality of climate change in their everyday lives we are drifting into a world of adaptation apartheid

5394627 the childrens museum of st johns will be contributing to the healthy kids day event with an exhibit on good nutrition and healthy eating including hands on games and activities using good for you foods
5394628 childhood obesity currently affects an estimated 15 percent of children under age 12 in the united states and we believe in educating children about the importance of exercise and healthy eating
5394629 i am sure that there will be some calmness in the whole turmoil in the next six to nine months
5394630 the world had to differentiate between the industrial and consumer parts of the global economy and recognise that they would behave differently as a result of todays difficult conditions including tightness in credit markets and commodity and food inflation
5394631 they such countries are continuing to grow and they need to grow they are not stopping their economic activity even if they have slowed down their progress
5394632 he was happy that policymakers were tackling some of the root causes of the financial crisis such as measures in the us to support mortgage lending even though concerns about inflation affecting food and oil are a clear worry

5394642 this building the last to fall on 9 11 is key to all controlled demolition theories
5394643 i remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
5394644 i remember getting a call from the fire department commander
5394645 i am well aware of mr silversteins statement but to the best of my recollection i did not speak to him on that day and i do not recall anyone telling me that they did either that doesnt mean he could not have spoken to someone from fdny it just means that i am not aware of it
5394646 telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire
5394647 weve had such terrible loss of life that it would be wise to blow up my building
5394648 weve had such terrible loss of life that it would be wise to withdraw firefighters to prevent further loss of life
5394649 and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
5394650 9 11 insurance fraudster larry silverstein like the poe narrator was apparently confounded by the noise of his own lying heartbeat when he confessed on national tv to making
5394651 i remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
5394652 the biggest decision we had to make was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged wtc 7 building a number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building the appraisals indicated that the buildings integrity was in serious doubt
5394653 silversteins inability to get anything built on the site during the past five years leaving a gigantic bomb crater screaming silently to the world that the wtc was destroyed by bombs not by planes is another far more eloquent confession
5394654 and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
5394655 larry silverstein the leaseholder for all three buildings essentially admitted to demolishing the building

5394681 i remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
5394682 the biggest decision we had to make was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged wtc 7 building a number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building the appraisals indicated that the buildings integrity was in serious doubt

5394690 even at this point i dont believe the secretary rumsfeld was confident that in fact a civilian airliner had hit the building i think they still speculated about a bomb a cruise missile a small aircraft but
5394691 the secretary was essentially incredulous but then again maybe that was just his manner he asked me if i was sure and as i said i was close enough to look into the windows of the airplane as it flew past there was no doubt in my mind what i had seen

5394720 from a total cost of ownership comodos authentication system provided rapid integration with minimal rollout dependencies which was a major advantage over any other solutions considered
5394721 our original two factor solution was somewhat cumbersome so we are very excited about the multiple solutions provided by comodo the addition of the comodo ev ssl certificates and comodo content verification certificates solutions to their two factor authentication solution allows us to stand by our commitment to offer our customers user friendly state of the art security solutions for their online transactions

5394731 with the generating reserve margin in the midwest regional market expected to decline to less than 5 percent by 2015 we believe it is prudent now to start planning additional clean sources of electric supply
5394732 while energy efficiency and renewables can provide some of the answer additional sources of generation will be needed as customer demand grows and older less efficient generating units are retired
5394733 legislative action this year is critical to the development of new energy sources and we will continue to support the general assembly in this effort
5394734 as the availability of power in the region declines we need to protect our customers from the increased price volatility that inevitably comes with tighter supplies long term contracting and the addition of new generation will be far less expensive over time than continuing to rely so heavily on the annual wholesale market
5394735 adequate electric supplies at predictable prices are a key to economic development
5394736 we will be unable to sell southwest ohio as a great place for businesses to prosper if we cannot assure them that we can meet their supply needs our comprehensive plan of energy efficiency and new sources of generation provides that surety

5394746 hello from charlotte i have now been back home from our trip to nepal for three weeks the first thing i did when i got back was have a bath and some pizza we got back on sunday evening and i had to go to school straight away on the monday and the first week i got back i kept waking up really early due to the time difference it was great to see my friends again even though some of the boys in my class called me a guinea pig and a lab rat because of all the medical testing we did charlotte patrick and some of the team high up in the himalayas my favourite bits of the trip were seeing all the wildlife and knowing i was in the himalayas my dad is still there helping with the adult medical study so now i am look forward to him coming back from nepal too we had the experience of a lifetime in nepal and i would love to go again hopefully when im older
5394747 hi its charlotte here and we are now back in namche we arrived back today and i was surprised to be met by my mum she had been walking higher up with patrick but he had got a bad headache at lobouche 4 900m and so they had to come down patrick was upset because he was not allowed to go any higher because of this even though everest base camp was only 400m higher but one of the scientists aiden also had a headache and had to come down so that made him feel a lot better every night weve been staying in lodges with small rooms with very thin walls like cardboard and dont get me started on the loos they are holes in the ground i know they are environmentally friendly but i dont like them you have to hold your nose when you go in i cant remember the last time i had a shower it gets very cold at night and more so the higher up the mountains you go the highest we got was tengboche 3 800m it is easter sunday tomorrow but we dont have any chocolate eggs which i am cross about most of the people here are buddhists and dont celebrate easter so well just have some normal chocolate bars instead
5394748 its charlotte again we are still having lots of fun in namche the village where the medical base is and the food is lovely noodle soup chapattis rice but all a bit spicy weve been getting up early 4 30am one day and 5 30am another it is still really cold then it has been lovely and warm during the day but freezing at night when we are trekking it gets hot but we have lots of rests and if we get really tired the sherpas who are the porters guides with us carry our rucksacks sometimes even the younger children get carried themselves lucky them we are still doing medical tests every day but now we are higher in the mountains it is getting harder to breathe when we do the exercises we can see everest from here and also an amazing mountain called ama dablam as today is aprils fool day we painted on our cousin williams face at 2 30am whilst he was asleep tomorrow we leave for our next base i cant wait but i am missing home a bit especially my friends hello izzy and emma and id love to eat some chips
5394749 hello from lottie the trek from kathmandu was tiring but we saw some beautiful sights as we walked higher we had to go over some quite scary rope bridges but we also saw everest on the final walk up to our next base it looked amazing when we got to namche bazaar i was also really excited as i finally saw my dad again this is where he is working and testing adults for the medical study weve done some more medical tests up here but i think we are now going to go to a nearby market im missing home a bit but it is wonderful here
5394750 hi its patrick again after doing a difficult walk going higher and higher from a height of 2800m to 3400m we have arrived at our next base which is called namche bazaar the last day and a half weve been acclimatising enjoying the sunshine and getting used to being at a high altitude laboratory where they are doing the medical tests and weve been doing more testing like we did when we first got to kathmandu yesterday i saw mount everest for the first time and it made me feel really excited knowing im going to trek to it tomorrow we will be walking up another 500m so i hope we will get even better views of it and then we will be walking to tengboche and going to a place called kalapathar which is even higher at 5545m which is meant to have great views of everest i still really hope that i can trek to everest base camp this would be the highest place i can go before it gets too dangerous for my age as there will be far less air i will keep you posted
5394751 hello from lottie im now in kathmandu which is the capital of nepal we arrived on sunday and have already have seen some sights and some monkeys which made everyone laugh so far ive enjoyed everything especially the nepalese dinner last night the rice and chips were yummy today ive done lots of tests and had a swim which was fun its all been amazing so far and cant wait for more
5394752 hi its patrick here we all arrived safely with loads of luggage in kathmandu and we are already enjoying the culture and food last night we had a traditional nepalese meal i tried roasted boar we have been spending today testing memory tests and breathing tests we have to do these every day the doctors want to see if anything changes when we go higher in the himalayas where there is less air but we managed to fit in a bit of sightseeing too tomorrow we will be starting the trek first we fly to a place call lukla and then start to trek to phakding i hope to tell you more soon

5394757 the allegations are not new and the iranian government knows well that they are untrue
5394758 the documented plan of the iranian government has always been to destroy the bahai community and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan
5394759 the group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners the zionists in particular
5394760 the best proof of this is the fact that time and again bahais have been offered their freedom if they recant their bahai beliefs and convert to islam an option few have taken

5394762 most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the bahais as agents of foreign powers whether of russia the united kingdom or the united states and now israel all of which are completely baseless

5394770 we were digging through debris we thought might be from near the towers bottom that was in fact from near the top mr
5394771 already working around the clock 1 300 construction workers and other personnel including 160 firefighters and 90 police officers have removed an extraordinary volume of debris 290 000 tons of the estimated 1 2 million at the site work crews from bovis lend lease a contractor excavating a sector that includes the south tower recently went looking for part of a lower floor said peter marchetto a bovis executive burrowing in at the spot suggested by the fire department they found instead signs for the 86th floor mr marchetto said
5394772 the fire department is also adjusting its operations at the site some underground smoldering continues at isolated spots particularly below where the north tower once stood but almost all the fires are now extinguished and active firefighting has all but come to a halt
5394773 the operation has been winding down in recent weeks there is one truck every 20 minutes the sooner its all over the better for me at its peak there would be 20 trucks lined up sometimes 40
5394774 red hot debris the removal of debris from the collapsed areas requires the safe lifting and maneuvering of very heavy steel beams often twisted and tangled from the force of the collapse some beams pulled from the wreckage are still red hot more than 7 weeks after the attack and it is suspected that temperatures beneath the debris pile are well in excess of 1 000 f one group of beams fell end first embedding themselves deeply into the subway system below the removal of these beams one of which struck an electrical equipment room is a delicate operation requiring close coordination with new york city transit although the 1 9 station below the trade center is heavily damaged 1 200ft are intact liro is working with new york city transit to shore up the station so that there will be no further damage
5394775 at ground zero the csu is responsible for photographing the site recovering physical evidence documenting body parts and any other physical evidence like weapons or a wallet manning the temporary morgue at the site as well as the city morgue up on 28th street inspecting debris that leaves the site and inspecting debris as it gets sifted out at staten island all evidence is documented airplane parts were essential to the beginning investigation but now they look for hair fibers glass particles semen ballistics we id every part pillars and beams are swiped for hair tissue and blood evaporated body evidence we have two police officers with mortuary degrees and they are either in the medical examiners office or the police lab because you must be a sworn police officer to take evidence if you step on a fly ten times there will be nothing left and here we have no couches no computers no chairs no glass any small trace of anything is evidence anything to bring closure to the families human body part clothing jewelry equipment and tools anything if there ever is a trial we will be prepared weve been here from day 1 and well be there well after the regular police officers go home when everyone is packed up and gone
5394776 law enforcement authorities survey the material for evidence only then is it released to a scrap processor under an existing long term contract with the nyc department of sanitation to purchase and then recycle scrap metal
5394777 as in a stubborn coal mine fire the combustion taking place deep below the surface is in many places not a fire at all
5394778 but the fire wont give up it is just a constant fight
5394779 the rescue workers soon started referring to the ruins of the world trade center as
5394780 when the world trade center towers fell the buildings became a heartbreaking mass grave and at a coldly physical level 1 2 million tons of tangled debris if a plan for removing that debris was going to be devised responsibly engineers and government officials needed to be much more specific about what materials lay in the wreckage leslie e robertson associates a structural engineering firm involved in building the trade center developed a more accurate assessment estimating that each of the twin towers contained 3 881 tons of steel reinforcing in the concrete floor slabs 47 453 tons of vertical steel columns 8 462 tons of aluminum and glass 2 531 tons of ceiling materials 4 218 tons of flooring and 31 350 tons of partitions or walls the total came to about 1 176 000 tons of debris including about 285 000 tons of steel a tightly controlled system of transportation disposal and recycling was developed with virtually every piece of the trade center now having a prescribed destination tracked at checkpoints the materials are shuttled from cranes to trucks to docks in manhattan and brooklyn and from there to investigation sites landfills and scrapyards nearby scrap recyclers have begun cutting shearing shredding and shipping the biggest volumes of metals they have ever faced recycling the steel and other metals could net a few tens of millions of dollars

5394800 ku berikan kepada laki laki tanggung jawab penuh sebagai pemimpin keluarga sebagai tiang penyangga agar dapat dipergunakan dengan sebaik baiknya dan hanya inilah kelebihan yang dimiliki oleh laki laki walaupun sebenarnya tanggung jawab ini adalah amanah di dunia amp akhirat
5394801 kalau saya mengikuti kemauan maia itu sama saja saya mengakui kalau mereka mereka artis wanita di mrc adalah penyebab keretakan dan kerusakan dalam rumah tangga saya yang jelas bukan mereka penyakit dan penyebab perusak rumah tangga saya
5394802 november 2006 maia tidak pulang ke rumah dan saya menemukan bukti bukti maia selingkuh dari situ maia sudah durhaka sebagai istri

5394861 many of the mistakes that were made by companies entering virtual environments in the past
5394862 were rooted in the way that they approached their involvement as a marketing exercise one where its all about promoting a product what makes virtual worlds unique though is their ability to immerse people in an experience and while we can try to find creative ways to immerse people in a product such as a soft drink makeup or computers the real connection comes from interacting with people
5394863 apart from pretend sex there is a lot to do in second life there are classes and lectures to attend at universities including yale and harvard news coverage and discussion from reuters design and architecture experiments films both showing and shooting art galleries and a shape matching game called tringo that was developed specifically for virtual world play big name companies are using the space to promote products toyota adidas general motors and sony bmg all preview their latest offerings there and ibm has commandeered a huge space largely cut off from the outside world for internal communication
5394864 trucking companies for instance are teaching drivers how to parallel park their vehicles using simulations built in second life hilton the hotel chain is collaborating on a tool to train receptionists in virtual lobbies and energy giants are developing applications that can help them to train staff on how to deal with a hostage situation on an oil rig
5394865 american media giant cbs ran a report on the way people with disabilities interact in the world businesses such as cisco and ibm are using it as company meeting and training ground and partially have it as a replacement to the video conference facility meanwhile universities are increasingly setting up shop there seeing second life as a much richer form of distance learning than has previously been possible
5394866 in addition to helping individual patients virtual worlds are being used for a host of other health related purposes medical schools are using them to train doctors health departments are using them to test first responders researchers are using them to gain insights into how epidemics spread health groups are using them to educate the public and raise money
5394867 at the ut dallas center for brain health some patients with aspergers syndrome are using virtual worlds to help acclimate them to the real world aspergers syndrome a form of autism is described by symptoms like a lack of demonstrated empathy which causes some difficulties in social interaction linden lab has been working with asperger patients for some time and several prominent second lifers like linden lab community teams torley linden and blogger tateru nino have aspergers as well
5394868 take harvard university which has offered for credit classes in second life for more than a year instructor rebecca nesson told me that virtual worlds when compared with earlier distance education technologies are a giant leap forward in their ability to enable communication class participation and certain types of simulated activities more than 100 other schools and universities have also held classes or sessions in second life
5394869 people spend over 1 5 billion on virtual items every year pets coins avatars and bling these virtual objects are nothing more than a series of digital 1s and 0s stored on a remote database somewhere in the ether what could possibly possess people to spend real hard earned cash on objects that have no tangible substance themselves with mocking the absurdities of some of these virtual worlds the reality is that there are many businesses out there making meaningful amounts of money in virtual goods

5394875 so far in my activities in the peoples republic of china i have come across no truly serious funds so i doubt that the water and sewage business in china will bring the yields the funds demand

5394924 he knew he wasnt a good teacher he had neither the vocation nor any particular abilities but this much was clear if gauss didnt go to high school he b ttner would have lived in vain he looked at him up and down eyes swimming then presumably to control his emotions grabbed the stick and gauss received the last beating of his life
5394925 people were acting or following some ritual that always obliged them to pause before they spoke or did something sometimes he managed to accommodate himself to them but then it became unendurable again only gradually did he come to understand that they needed these pauses why did they think so slowly so laboriously and hard

5395099 coach mckillop has done a terrific job stressing that all these guys are going to play as a team
5395100 all these guys are terrific high school basketball players and theyre going to be terrific college players team usa needs guys who are going to sacrifice maybe points and give themselves up on defense and the little things in the game

5395134 it is an extremely talented group of people who work as a team to advance the institutions interests they are responsible for the effectiveness of the office and deserve credit for the gains we have made over the past eight years
5395135 their experience and skills will allow the provosts office to run smoothly and effectively through the transition to a new provost and beyond
5395136 my term as interim provost wont in any way affect the initiatives already in place they have already been approved and set in motion i have no plans to implement any particular new initiatives it would only create unnecessary problems
5395137 it doesnt seem smart to me to push forward any new changes when in three or four months the new provost could disagree with my decisions we want to keep pushing the initiatives we are already committed to
5395138 i will continue to work on the social sciences albeit in close collaboration with others it would not be good if we let that just sit for several months we need to continue building on the momentum that has been created in recent years we are all making sure to work very hard and importantly together
5395139 pell will be superb for the job ive worked with her over the past several years she has extraordinary international experience her work with ciifad and bahir dar will prove beneficial she has done consulting in afghanistan and africa shes extremely knowledgeable in international issues shell be dynamic and very productive
5395140 because of the breadth of cornells programs from veterinary medicine to the humanities to programs in the social sciences and a long history of working internationally we have huge potential and i hope we can come together and realize that potential

5395176 it was a very creative a very exciting time to be living in london it almost seemed natural to be living with a lion and to have him sitting in the back of a car going up and down the kings road
5395177 there was such trust between today christians former owners had been told the lion wouldnt recognize them but the video shows the lions obvious joy at being reunited with the two men us and such love he ran toward us with such love and excitement in his eyes and we felt exactly the same way we were just so excited to see him looking so big and healthy the story had just turned out so beautifully when it could have had a very different ending
5395178 when he first starts seeing us hes looking looking is it us is it us and then suddenly he says right this is them and down he comes and there wasnt a moment that we ever doubted that it was going to be a wonderful greeting we never doubted it
5395179 he was with wild lionesses he had a litter of cubs and his genes had been passed on back into the wild after that time we saw him he was never seen again it was like a final farewell he was completely integrated back into the wild

5395226 completely failed to address the concerns of the appellants with respect to the fact that the city of oaklands gay straight employees alliance was openly allowed to attack the bible in widespread city e mails to deride christian values as antiquated and to refer to bible believing christians as hateful when the plaintiffs attempted to refute this blatant attack on people of faith they were threatened with immediate termination by the city of oakland the ninth circuit did not feel that the threat of immediate termination had any effect on free speech
5395227 google has set its sights very very high with android to build the first complete open and free mobile platform
5395228 however by involving more than 30 technology and mobile partners the android birth was never going to be smooth or timely as there are just too many voices to be heard
5395229 the carriers have a certain set of requirements the handset manufacturers another set and the developers another set
5395230 true they might be all playing off the same hymn sheet but certainly theyll be playing their own instruments and trying to make theirs sound the loudest
5395231 contrast the android development process with that of the iphone apple built the hardware the software sold the product and selected the carriers this was the key to its quick development and its early success
5395232 hoping to shore up the future mobile operating system space much like microsoft with ms dos in the late eighties and early nineties

5395240 marketers already recognise that online advertising must be incorporated into any comprehensive ad strategy this will continue to drive growth in online ad spending well beyond the forecast period

5395247 this session provided some remarkable insights into the green supply chain interconnections complexities and bottlenecks those insights will be extremely valuable to the forums ongoing sustainable development workstreams and initiatives
5395248 i read anne enrights novel the gathering for ireland in the challenge here is a link to my review
5395249 i want to read the book now after reading amys review which ends with a fascinating quote
5395250 theres a growing storehouse of intellectual property ip in our third level institutions which has the potential to create vibrant new products services and businesses
5395251 however it is also vital there are those within the academic community who devote some of their energies to commercialisation of new discoveries and there is huge satisfaction to be had from seeing an idea turned into a product or service which others want to buy
5395252 given that significant investment in developing a strong innovation and commercialisation system only really started at the turn of the century the progress made to date has been remarkable
5395253 in the three year period 2005 07 the third level sector produced 95 licences 26 start up companies along with hundreds of patents and invention disclosures
5395254 media companies can distribute content to where their readers hang out
5395255 ireland has long been a hub for innovation in e learning
5395256 we see a unique opportunity to position ourselves as the next generation of personnel e learning solutions provider
5395257 we believe there are many opportunities to harness complementary technology some in conjunction with our own technology and we are keen to license such suitable technologies from irish universities
5395258 the net impact for our region last year was 21 replacement jobs within the tssg in fact we hired several more and 61 jobs in companies that we spun off last year
5395259 if you look at the knock on impact we reckon we created about 200 jobs last year as a result of our work
5395260 its substantially more effective than the best universities in the world
5395261 if you look at what makes a product great it has to hit a need seeing a business problem and having the right features to address it
5395262 if companies dont have the skills in house to build it they can look outside for technology that adds value
5395263 most software firms dont have resources to direct relatively esoteric research so its best done at universities

5395273 for a long time the mahindra group has aspired to become the number one tractor manufacturer in the world with our alliance we will achieve the goal in a much more rapid way
5395274 we dont want to jump the gun on us becoming the number one now we are waiting for this year to get over and then see the results
5395275 consolidation will happen over a period of time and not from day one however there will be synergy between the operations

5395280 i thought the wailings we heard at night were the coyotes barking at the moon
5395281 i didnt know until later that those sounds were the cries of women being raped in the mexican desert some less than 100 yards away from the border there was absolutely nothing anyone could do about it
5395282 nonprofit groups and even the u s office of refugee resettlement which has custody of unaccompanied children estimate that the vast majority of women and female children encounter some sort of sexual assault en route to the united states
5395283 its become the norm and in many cases with female children they just assume that theres been some sort of incident
5395284 a lot of times women because they know whats coming will align themselves with one man in the group
5395285 whether you consider that assault or not i guess its a blurry line
5395286 we know this kind of thing is happening and it gets reported every once in awhile
5395287 the degree to which it happens is not well known but women are particularly vulnerable when they come into contact with agents
5395288 congress did an investigation and found thousands of cases of misconduct and that getting green cards for sex was a very common form of bribery
5395289 you have women who are very vulnerable in every sense of the word they may have young children with them maybe theyre trying to reunite with family members on this side of the border officials doing this bribery know that theyre in a complete position of power
5395290 anyone from coyotes to u s officials they all have the upper hand here
5395291 our society takes rape seriously but it doesnt take this type of rape seriously in all of our national discourse around securing our borders rarely if ever do you hear about any kind of protection for people who might be crossing largely thats because the discussion has been framed around protecting us protecting the u s and once you get into that framework what happens to the other person is not even on the radar

5395294 during a recent google search i ran across a blog by me where i had mentioned a book two years ago the hidden diary of marie antoinette by carolly erickson its a novel about france in the time of louis xvi the last king of france both he and his wife marie antoinette died on the guillotine during the french revolution heres my review
5395295 this was one case where the diary format really didnt work for me i did find that it worked in sandra gullands trilogy about josephine bonaparte which would also be another excellent choice to read about france
5395296 what is the best country in the world in environmental performance
5395297 the fact is people can dispose of old or broken electronic equipment free of charge rather than paying to get rid of such equipment by disposing of it in the black bin in a skip or at the local dump

5395305 stunned at the number of phone calls i got prosecutors saying they had been in trials where the words murderer and crime scene had been removed
5395306 rape is a crime of power not about sex so when a victim has to get up and talk about when she had sexual intercourse with the accused its just wrong
5395307 there is only a crime scene if there is a crime which is a question for the jury to decide
5395308 to permit witnesses to call the complainant a victim where the whole issue is whether or not the complainant has been victimized is inconsistent with the presumption of innocence that every accused person is entitled to
5395309 this takes away the victims right to say it so the jury only has his word
5395310 there is something profoundly disturbing about a judge telling a citizen that she cannot say she was raped when testifying as a victim in a criminal case particularly when the victim is presumably trying to do nothing more than describe what happened to her this brings to mind the blue burkas of a distant place
5395311 i just dont want the language ban i just dont want to call it sex it wasnt sex
5395312 rhodri morgan has clearly panicked and bowed to pressure from backbench labour mps and parliamentary candidates
5395313 long suffering patients across wales will be relieved that jane hutt is no longer in a position to reap further misery and mismanagement on the nhs
5395314 this is clearly a move to shore up labours crumbling support ahead of the general election rather than a well thought out policy to improve standards in the health service
5395315 there is widespread distrust in new labour across wales because of its handling of the health service
5395316 however any change in personnel must be accompanied by a willingness to move away from a failing policy
5395317 the problem was never jane hutt personally but her and her governments ineffective policies
5395318 her strategy was to enhance local accountability through local health boards and increase their working relationships with the unitary authorities in relation to social care through co terminosity
5395319 this strategy has been successful in some areas of wales but not in others
5395320 jane hutt worked closely with a variety of organisations throughout the nhs including bma cymru wales and we hope that the new minister will continue to forge strong links with the professions
5395321 it now seems to be an appropriate time to hand over the responsibility of the nhs to a fresh mind
5395322 weve had concerns about the health service in wales for some time but its a difficult portfolio

5395363 he was a man of great character faith and genuine good will to all his optimism and love for life his family and country should be an example to us all
5395364 he passed away with honor something you and your fellow scumbags will never achieve

5395390 we are assessing the global status of the loggerhead turtle identifying unique population segments and determining how each population contributes to the species ability to survive is a key factor in the assessment
5395391 the observed decline in nests over the past two decades represents a loss in the number of hatchlings that will enter the population which in turn may further reduce the adult population over time
5395392 with fewer breeding adults the decline in nests may continue and affect the species ability to survive and recover

5395395 the college republicans engaged in unequivocally protected political expression and it strains all credibility to think the sfsu administration does not know this
5395396 there is nothing to try or investigate here other than protected expression
5395397 sfsu has a duty to uphold the first amendment rights of all of its students even if their expressive activity offends the religious sensibilities of some
5395398 to give all parties the confidence that they will be heard and fairly treated by a panel that includes representatives of all the universitys key constituencies
5395399 if you continue to ignore your constitutional obligations you risk personal liability for depriving your students of their rights
5395400 the first amendment protects using or destroying flags in political protest and even sfsu administrators must realize that they cannot prosecute students for failing to respect a religious symbol

5395615 the issue here is consensual sex involving two youngsters under 16
5395616 there might be some circumstances where you would want to mark that this was a gross breach by one child of another childs rights and safety
5395617 but mostly under age sex is between consenting young people who have probably not been properly guided and have not been given proper adult supervision and support who are in need of care and welfare rather than prosecution
5395618 often parents abdicate their responsibility and leave it up to schools health professionals and others
5395619 perhaps as a society we need to help parents more to have the tools to have these discussions with their children

5395627 the magic of pauls intelligence is that he has more patience than anyone ive ever met and with it he simply wears problems down to count a hundred million stars he told me once at the rate of one per second sounds like a job that no one could possibly complete in a lifetime in reality it would only take three years the key is focus a willingness not to be distracted and that is pauls gift an intuition of just how much a person do slowly

5395649 in general healthy economic growth depends on well functioning financial markets
5395650 consequently helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority
5395651 many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress in part because the outlook for the economy and thus for credit quality remains uncertain

5395665 intentional coordinated and calculated acts to get around the system of regulatory safeguards
5395666 i do agree that we need to keep burlesque and bellydance separate not associated at all
5395667 it is another shackle fastened on dancers who are burdened with quite enough already i fear it is a shackle that we in the west all will come to feel as well meanwhile from an artistic point of view i always assume when a dancer resorts to this sort of approach it is because that dancer lacks the talent to get attention in any other way it is too bad those limitations can and will hurt others
5395668 no different than presenting belly dance together with samba or polynesian or salsa or any other form of dance or performance
5395669 didnt have much respect for them but loved the show and had lots of fantasies read stupid grin on face as well
5395670 the show of mine in the uk a few weeks ago that was referred to in the gilded serpent article the shimmy shake show in london actually did not include belly dance burlesque fusion but merely presented the two together
5395671 look im dancing and enjoying what im doing its ok for you to look look right here
5395672 here i enjoy dancing see how i control my movements my body and yes its alright for you to watch
5395673 i dont see many belly dancers who come across as if they are
5395674 yeah im up here maybe portraying a fantasy or maybe portraying something silly or strange and i want you to know im ok with it and its ok if you watch because i embrace my sensuality
5395675 here i am im shakin it i like shakin it and look i want you to like that im shakin it and youre invited to watch in fact im going to insist that you watch
5395676 well im wearing this costume that makes you think of a minsky review but ill get upset and indignant if you compare it to that because im just not that kind of girl
5395677 then again buttering a slice of toast could be about sex if someone wanted to make innuendo and present it that way
5395678 and when i say sensuality im not talking about lascivious thoughts im talking about the senses being engaged
5395679 most of us realize that the success of bellydance as an art form will reflect on the plight of bellydancers in the arab world who are often regarded as prostitutes
5395680 the aoualem are professional singers and dancers apparently there are two kinds those who conduct themselves with decency and have earned the respect of honest people and those who have no modesty and inspire only disgust the first are much vaunted for their songs and the art with which they are executed but we were not able to see or hear them they left cairo we were told when the french captured the city only at the end of our stay did they venture back to the capital but they remained hidden and we were unable to overcome their repugnance of singing in front of men and particularly in front of the french
5395681 um who in the hell thinks belly dance is stripping a moron that doesnt need to be educated anyways
5395682 nude sex bombs of exotic dance the hottest show around
5395683 i said bellydance in the bedroom it isnt usually in the bedroom thats the fusion so by telling them it would be in the bedroom i was making it clear they are two separate things
5395684 please understand i am only doing this tongue in cheek fusion for you guys moves 5 10 are bellydance the rest is a fantastical idea i had after watching late night television do not try this at home
5395685 i think that you should produce your own shows that focus on your vision
5395686 i know people at my work who saw me reading a book on burlesque were surprised by the very things listed in the webster dictionary description they thought it was all stripping and shaking the tatas
5395687 as i said before and i still think spoon said was i right
5395688 why we should expect that the art form either actually be held in higher esteem here than in its home countries is beyond me
5395689 this may seem incredibly obvious but i certainly hope that the role of women in society is much more highly elevated and respected here and that the movement and display of the human body as well as the role of entertainers within society at large both male and female is more frequently experienced and more appreciated here in the us among many many other differences between the two cultures i would certainly hope that this dance would be treated differently here in the us than in its native lands
5395690 there are also other principles to consider here which are quite universal
5395691 feminine power is threatening to those especially men who do not feel empowered themselves
5395692 if it is of god it will succeed if not it will meet its own end
5395693 the issue is not the goodness or badness of sexuality if we are whole unstifled humans our sexuality will be part of everything we do
5395694 while im not interested in going back and forth with you spoonie i would like to correct a couple of your assertions
5395695 feminine power is threatening to those especially men who do not feel empowered themselves
5395696 its kind of flirty sexy and fun and you wont even have to take any of your clothes off
5395697 coming of age belly dance class for teenage girls because something positive has to be done to help them learn to love and respect their changing bodies
5395698 while she is doing a burlesque fusion there is no nudity or overtly sexual content
5395699 the question is how many mothers would send their daughters to a bellydance class if the general impression of bellydance is that it is too
5395700 intelligent people can make a distinction between burlesque and bellydance even if the two are side by side
5395701 and i personally do not want bellydance associated with fishnets ruffle panties peekaboo skirts gaudy bras with boobs spilling out of them and oversexualized camp that is the realm of burlesque
5395702 ok there will be burlesque and there will be bellydance so obviously im going to see some of both and maybe some fusion
5395703 burlesque might not reqire nudity but it does by definition require sexualisation overt sexual teasing and an element of ludeness
5395704 depending on who you ask belly dance is adult entertainment at least in most middle eastern countries
5395705 why some arabs consider the dance to sometimes be not family friendly
5395706 why are you suggesting i posted a dead link on purpose
5395707 heres a link with a pic from a now defunct youtube video
5395708 depending on who you ask belly dance is adult entertainment at least in most middle eastern countries
5395709 she was not just making up arguments that suit her needs
5395710 children do belly dance and children do not do burlesque
5395711 i would argue that any sex brought into the art comes from the individual dancer and not from the art itself
5395712 americans see a dancer and say lets see her dance
5395713 i would argue that any sex brought into the art comes from the individual dancer and not from the art itself
5395714 motherpuffer that is also a really good point sexy is in the eye of the beholder
5395715 the twinkle in fifi abdos eyes when she dances arent reflections from the spotlights ya know and she was also known for telling bawdy jokes full of innuendo during her private party shows sahar hamdi wasnt a fragile flower when she danced she got rather crude dina makes orgasm faces theres something sometimes its subtle sometimes its almost indefinable
5395716 i believe that bellydance is an art that can have a role to play in enhansing the status of women and their freedom to express their femininity to a greater degree in the middle east if it becomes a prestigeous respected art to the western mainstream
5395717 fusions that potentially cause belly dance in its entirety to find itself eventually under state law as adut themed after we have come so far thus requiring permits
5395718 the genitals pubic region and areola of the female breast as well as portions of the body covered by supporting straps
5395719 unfortunately they still have the power to shape what we are and are not able to do
5395720 lots of the posts on this thread have been really amazing and i think this makes 200 so guess its time to get that t shirt made

5395724 were entering a new age of understanding climate change by adding more sound reliable data about whats really happening in the atmosphere and on the ground
5395725 very high accuracy in the data collected is the key to getting a feel for the national trend thats what the climate reference network is doing
5395726 all the stations are strategically placed in rural environments away from the influences of nearby urban areas that would confound the interpretation of any changes observed
5395727 monitoring and understanding climate is a long term endeavor we need to have updated systems such as the historical climatology network in place for the long haul
5395728 help explain whats happening with the climate at the regional and local level and serve as a baseline for evaluating other meteorological data

5395741 declining lake levels have slowed slightly due to further reductions in hydro station flow releases and water conserved through broad implementation of mandatory water use restrictions this past week
5395742 if you think of the river as a glass of water its still just over half full when normally it would be around three fourths full however we can tell people are conserving and its making a difference
5395743 duke energy along with major public water system operators encourages everyone to continue conserving water following mandatory use restrictions and sharing the responsibility as stewards of this regions limited water supply

5395835 dhani masih dipandang sebelah mata dhani juga masih berusaha membangun image lewat bandnya
5395836 bakat dhani sudah kelihatan sejak dia yunior saya dulu sebagai anak sma yang nggak hanya mampu nyanyi tapi juga bikin lagu kan hebat tuh
5395837 kami tidak pernah memiliki perasaan cinta apa pun apalagi saat itu usia kami cukup belia untuk mengenal cinta
5395838 tapi tentu wajar sebagai orangtua meragukan musikalitas dhani apalagi waktu itu kan belum ada musisi yang sukses seperti sekarang
5395839 jadi sebetulnya bukan karena dhani cuma lulusan sma tapi lebih pada keraguan kemampuan dhani yang hanya anak band
5395840 ada awal dan ada akhir ada bahagia dan ada kesedihan kita hidup selalu di beri pilihan kebahagiaan didapat dari bgymana kita melihatnya memory tdk bisa di hapus tp dijadikan pegangan dan pelajarn yg berarti ada beberapa bagian yg bisa di pahami free your heart from hate free your mind from worry live simple give more expect less mudah2an bermanfaat good luck

5395844 apa yang menyebabkan engkau menangis wahai fathimah semoga allah swt tidak menyebabkan matamu menangis
5395845 ayahanda penggilingan dan urusan urusan rumahtanggalah yang menyebabkan ananda menangis
5395846 ayahanda sudikah kiranya ayahanda meminta aliy suaminya mencarikan ananda seorang jariah untuk menolong ananda menggiling gandum dan mengerjakan pekerjaan pekerjaan di rumah
5395847 ya rasulullah saw demi allah tuhan yang telah menjadikan baginda dengan kebenaran sebagai nabi dan rasul nya kalaulah baginda menyuruh hamba menggiling syair dari masyriq dan maghrib pun niscaya hamba gilingkan semuanya
5395848 hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya adalah manusia dan batu penjaganya para malaikat yang kasar yang keras yang tidak mendurhakai allah terhadap apa yang dititahkan nya kepada mereka dan mereka mengerjakan apa yang dititahkan
5395849 bergembiralah karena engkau adalah salah satu dari batu mahligai fathimah az zahra di dalam sorga
5395850 jika allah swt menghendaki wahai fathimah niscaya penggilingan itu berputar dengan sendirinya untukmu
5395851 teruskanlah amalmu maka allah swt telah mengampunimu akan sesuatu yang telah lalu dari dosamu dan sesuatu yang akan datang

5395854 termasuk pengakuannya via telepon dengan seseorang bahwa dia pernah melewati masa masa indah bersama orang kuat tersebut
5395855 dalam rekaman yang kami miliki maia mengakui perselingkuhannya dia bilang demi allah jangan diceritakan ke orang saya sudah making love dengan bang x itu direkam februari 2007 kemarin
5395856 kalau memang perlu kami akan memutar rekaman pengakuan perselingkuhan maia agar orang tidak menduga duga apa yang terjadi sesungguhnya
5395857 karena istri saya sudah melakukan upaya hukum dan telah dipublikasikan oleh pengacaranya sehingga timbul opini yang memojokkan saya dan mengarah pada character assasination pada citra diri saya maka dengan terpaksa saya akan mempertimbangkan untuk melaporkan balik perzinahan yang dilakukan istri saya
5395858 tidak lain agar sebagian masyarakat yang selama ini telah menempatkan saya sebagai suami yang jahat arogan tidak tahu perasaan perempuan tidak bertanggungjawab dan setumpuk predikat busuk lainnya dapat juga memahami serta memaklumi saya
5395859 marilah memulai hidup yang lebih baik dengan tetap berpegang teguh kepada ajaran agama yang kami yakini bersama ingat selamanya perang tidak akan menghasilkan apa apa melainkan kehancuran jangan menunggu hikmah dengan pengorbanan apapun yang tidak sepadan
5395860 ahmad dani dan bala pengacaranya gemar menjelek jelekkan maia menuduh maia bekerjasama dgn infotainment tapi yang lebih banyak di infotainment nongol dengan hal hal silly adalah dani kerja sama dgn stasiun yg setia itu tuh tadi pagi nonton dani maksaaaaaa banget ngekor anaknya dul yang sedang field trip ke sea world lalu sok pamer kemesraan bapak anak dengan mencium cium si dul padahal jelas dulnya keliatan ogah dan malu ya eyalah temen teman yang lain ortunya enggak ada yang ikut mungkin hanya dhani aja yang ujug ujug nongol sama crew sctv was was lucunya narasi waswas malah menyebut bahwa pihak sekolah sebenarnya agak keberatan dengan kemunculan dani yang membuat suasana kurang tenang text writer nya bodoh ya dan mungkin maksud narasi itu mau menekankan bahwa dani tu saking topnya buat suasana fieldtrip itu jadi heboh krn dani kan bintang top lalu intinya mau nunjukkin dani yang dekat dan perhatiaaaaaan sekali sama anak tapi kesan yang dihasilkan malah silly dani nih kesan saya setelah nonton infotainment yang kamu udah dibayar itu kamu terlalu desperate mau show off ke publik bahwa kamu lebih deket sama anak2 tetapi malah membuat acara yang seharusnya jadi sarana anak mendapat pengetahuan menjadi tidak seharusnya pake melayani foto2 dengan orang orang di sana konsekuensinya dul mungkin jadi tidak konsentrasi dalam mengerjakan tugas yang diberikan guru pihak sekolah dan para guru juga kemungkinan besar kurang setuju dengan kehadiran infotainment yang jelas menimbulkann suasana yang tidak kondusif ngga semua orang mau disorot serta mengganggu konsentrasi murid murid lain terlalu egois dengan kepentingan sendiri kamu tidak perduli kepentingan umum kepentingan sekolah murid lain dan kepentingan anak kamu sendiri duh dani kalau anakku sekolah di situ sdh aku perkarakan kamu acara tersebut ga ngaruh ke aku sbg audience karena jelas sekali unsur rekayasanya kamu malah keliatan super silly dengan keliatan menyetir infotainment kesimpulannya dan walau bagaimanapun kamu ingin nunjukkin ke publik betapa dekatnya anak2 ke kamu seorang ibu adalah figur yang tidak bisa dipisahkan dari anak2 denger ya aku juga wanita pekerja suami membiarkan aku bekerja aku juga kerap ke luar kota dan luar negeri tetep aja anak anak ku lebih dekat ke aku dari pada suamiku tetep aja aku yang paling besar andilnya pada urusan sekolah anak kalau ada pelajaran susah serta tes dsbnya aku yang mengajarkan semua teman teman wanita aku juga begitu baik yang sibuk bekerja atau tidak merekalah yang lebih punya andil urusan anak jangan coba meremehkan peran ibu apalagi mencoba mengambil alih quality over quantity juga berlaku di sini ngapain juga ngekor ikut field trip anak bawa infotainment eh tapi di rumah anak anakmu kamu cuekin terus mereka out of control malah download file2 yang tidak semestinya jangan salahin istri ya justru kamu tuh mesti rangkul istri kamu dalam keadaan jadi bercerai atau tidak kalian berdua harus kerja sama jangan coba melakukan yang impossible dilakukan maia you are a yummy mummy dari cerita no 511 marina kayanya jangan2 si ad itu terinspirasi sama cerita di blognya maia yang lagi2 bagi2 jam ke tiga anak2nya chia

5395868 domain name a year later they incorporated the company but given that its an internet company i reckon its appropriate to mark the anniversary on the day the domain name was registered
5395869 burton group believes many enterprises will begin investigating saas offerings for collaboration and content due to googles industry influence but recommends organisations wait for market maturity or look to more sophisticated offerings
5395870 they are cars but they are a step up from a motorcycle
5395871 it is the difference between walking and driving a car
5395872 it failed to meet u s emissions and safety standards geely would have to restructure and rebuild the vehicles to meet our specifications the vehicles were less than overwhelming
5395873 i found it surprising i have a wonderful working relationship with katherine it was surprising katie is an outspoken person and we know that already
5395874 cifrado de las conversaciones desde l neas de telefon a cableadas
5395875 aaaah naaan mais on devrait dire n gre passque cest plus proche du latiiiin
5395876 its about doing the hard work of information gathering understanding the labor market and what are the opportunities for entry level as well as incumbent workers and getting the lay of the land in terms of whats already in place what are successful institutions or programs we can build on and its really important to develop the relationships and get buy in from the key institutions
5395877 weve had some strong leaders in this town who refused to let colquitt become a statistic
5395878 its been our mission statement from the beginning that swamp gravy was to raise economic development sustain itself and colquitt and empower individuals in the process
5395879 but i think theres a better working relationship because you are together as a team onstage
5395880 both groups come to the theater not knowing exactly what to do so theyre learning together everybody is required to be there during rehearsals and do their part
5395881 it doesnt matter what color you are what age you are even the children are held to the same responsibilities of the adults
5395882 this is about our town and our people when you tell a story you have to put everything else aside to give respect to that story and to the people who told it and that takes time and effort
5395883 its located right off the town square and the whole town pitched in including prison laborers and cleaned out the warehouse piece by piece raising money to pay for it as they went along they got a concrete floor air conditioning and plumbing
5395884 they come from different family backgrounds and financial backgrounds but they all come together for a common purpose which is to do swamp gravy for the town
5395885 a restaurant a hotel a childrens art center a retail store and a theater
5395886 swamp gravy is the engine that keeps everything else running people come into town eat in your restaurant shop in your shops theres a place for your kids to go after school all those things come together to make it work
5395887 you can wear out your volunteers in a town of 2 000
5395888 they spend four to five months a year in practice and rehearsal so asking them to do another couple of months can be pretty exhausting
5395889 she always had to be on the bottom floor of the stage
5395890 this year the play was written so she could make it to the top of the stage a temporary ramp was built for her to get to the top of the stage in hopes that we could get a permanent ramp
5395891 they may not be in a wheelchair but they have other challenges in life
5395892 but i think other cast members have empathy for her knowing how important it is to be at the top of the stage the story in the play is her story its not necessarily to get to the top of the stage but to get somewhere that she had never been able to get to before she does that in the play and i think it was a real eye opener for the cast
5395893 its important that all stories are told not just one group of stories
5395894 the characters are of all races and backgrounds and they have an importance to the play that gives people ownership of their story and being able to share that with other people they want to be involved in that process
5395895 many of the people in the play give their own stories its a collaboration
5395896 they have their characters and it goes along with black white young old its important for the young people to be able to tell their stories also so that they feel a part of the process they are our future so we want to make sure that they feel open enough to tell their stories
5395897 we have a joke that if you put a mirror under their nose and it fogs up theyre in the play
5395898 anyone who wants to participate is incorporated if a child is too small to have a speaking part well have him doing something on the set
5395899 some of the people involved with swamp gravy always encourage people to move here weve become an arts magnet henny penny video television production company is a spin off of community people developing their own business this little town has a lot of heart and spirit and theyll make it work
5395900 youve got to have strong leadership to help move those folks in the right direction have some structure in place and have professionals deal with it
5395901 sometimes its easier for an outsider to give you a suggestion than it is for one of your own
5395902 were not making big oodles of money but we are holding our own
5395903 in the future we hope to make a larger profit its a real challenge to keep up those businesses when swamp gravy is not going on that was one of the reasons for incorporating the professional productions
5395904 also when swamp gravy started in the beginning it was so hard to get tickets
5395905 it got to the point where people wouldnt even try anymore by having things at cotton hall all the time people are getting the message we have tickets to more things
5395906 thats one of the benefits the cast has they have opportunities they may not otherwise have
5395907 some of the kids and adults have never been out of colquitt for them to be able to go to savannah and stay in the nicest hotel and eat in the nicest restaurant or go to washington is a great experience for them most of them have never seen anything higher than a two story building and for them to be able to go out is great
5395908 were always checking with other theaters how do you do this and that
5395909 weve gone through a lot of trial and error because there is no other project quite like this
5395910 weve made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election
5395911 its not an easy decision and especially because i support a robust system of public financing of elections
5395912 the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken and we face opponents whove become masters at gaming this broken system
5395913 john mccains campaign and the republican national committee are fueled by contributions from washington lobbyists and special interest pacs and weve already seen that hes not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so called 527 groups who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations
5395914 from the very beginning of this campaign i have asked my supporters to avoid that kind of unregulated activity and join us in building a new kind of politics and you have
5395915 instead of forcing us to rely on millions from washington lobbyists and special interest groups youve fueled this campaign with donations of 5 10 20 whatever you can afford
5395916 and because you did weve built a grassroots movement of over 1 5 million americans
5395917 the sure sign youre being condescended to nor do i think that there is anything about that post that suggests condescension
5395918 his campaign never good at setting expectations shouldnt have promised something that obama is apparently incapable of delivering
5395919 i see that obama has retracted his pledge to use public financing personally i think it was overzealous naive idealism for him to have promised it and in view of the expensive primary campaign and an increasingly realistic sense of what it will take to beat the corporate institution that is the gop and clean elections cheater john mccain in particular hes making what i think is the right decision the rightwing is already making hay with this so perhaps we can leave the bashing about it to them
5395920 if hillary was now our candidate whether or not she wouldnt do exactly what he is doing i know what i think
5395921 for most of his campaign big donors have been obamas mainstay
5395922 to work for the global removal of non human great apes from the category of mere property and for their immediate protection through the implementation of basic legal principles designed to provide these amazing creatures with the right to life the freedom of liberty and protection from torture
5395923 a rich emotional and cultural existence in which they experience emotions such as fear anxiety and happiness
5395924 this is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defence of our evolutionary comrades which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity
5395925 pilate having scourged jesus delivered him to them to be crucified and they crucified him
5395926 and being in agony he prayed the longer and his sweat became as drops of blood trickling down upon the ground
5395927 father forgive them for they know not what they do
5395928 i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels
5395929 my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of death
5395930 sacar a la ciudad del estado de postracion y miseria bla bla bla etc es pan comido a piece of cake
5395931 new york is the most dynamic city in the world but when it comes to the internet were stuck in the dial up age
5395932 i want to figure out ways to change that and to use broadband to bring in jobs help schools and make the city safer there are over 1 1 million schoolchildren in new york city public schools shouldnt they all have access to the vast information resources of the internet in the home as well
5395933 for new york to remain competitive in the global market place we must ensure that every new yorker is given access to high speed and reliable internet connections
5395934 these hearings are critical to focusing broad political attention and building consensus for the need to guarantee all new yorkers an opportunity to participate in the 21st century economy
5395935 today one of the greatest catalysts for fostering economic opportunity and opening up new worlds to young and old is access to the internet for many people especially those in underserved communities the digital divide has not been closed in order for people to realize the benefits of this technology for education employment and training they must have the infrastructure in place we must help bring the power of technology into peoples lives especially in underserved areas like the bronx with the hope that every family can have the tools for success in todays technology rich economy
5395936 in a world that is increasingly reliant on high speed easily accessible internet not having high speed internet access is like not having air to breathe
5395937 broadband technology is the lifeblood of the new economy and to keep new york city at the forefront of the 21st century global market it is vital that residents businesses and visitors in the city have access to high speed quality universal internet to connect them wherever they may be
5395938 the digital divide is a serious issue facing our society so i applaud the attention council member brewer has brought to this issue here in new york city many underserved communities wont survive in this new information age without the technical knowledge many of us take for granted the bottom line is we need to use out of the box thinking to ensure that todays technology is used to improve the future of new yorkers this broadband advisory committee hearing and the ones to follow in the coming weeks is the first major step toward truly bridging the technology gap
5395939 this must be a high national priority if our communities and our country are going to be competitive and successful in the 21st century
5395940 those with less education those with lower household incomes and americans ages 65 and older are less likely to have embraced broadband than those who are younger and have higher socio economic status
5395941 was bugs meanie behind the stolen cookies wikipedia brown checked twitter
5395942 i received your letter but unfortunately there is nothing i can do
5395943 this willingness to sacrifice oneself as a korbun for hashem is not a good trait a rabbi has to be like a father to his talmidim the situation of a rebbe giving his talmidim as a korbun bears a remarkable resemblance to molech an avodah zarah involving a parent sacrificing a child
5395944 i wonder if anybody ever asked rav simcah if he thought that his father had taken the correct course

5395949 58 of adult americans have used a cell phone or personal digital assistant to do at least one of ten mobile non voice data activities such as texting emailing taking a picture looking for maps or directions or recording video
5395950 yeah yeah sounds good but im still going to send all my email in html because it lets me run a big pretty product picture
5395951 this message contains a rich text html portion consult your mail clients documentation for information on how to view it
5395952 the only candidate who isnt just talking about cracking down on china i have a specific plan
5395953 there are two kinds of people living in finland those who have citizenship and those who dont
5395954 unless you plan to commit suicide the moment the net worth of what you have produced outweighs the cost of your keep so dont do it to others
5395955 finns get really upset if anybody hints at the possibly that we allied with germans
5395956 its funny nobody ever tells me to go back where i came from
5395957 you yourself question the right of some people to live in finland but you dont question my righ to be here
5395958 finland later also earned respect in the west for the strength of its democracy and its refusal to allow extension of nazi anti semitic practices in finland finnish jews served in the finnish army and jews were not only tolerated in finland but most jewish refugees were granted asylum 8 of the more than 500 refugees were handed over to the nazis 8 the field synagogue in eastern karelia was probably unique on the axis side during the war in the few cases in which jewish officers from finlands defence forces were awarded the german iron cross they declined 9
5395959 2 finlands actions did contribute to the siege of leningrad
5395960 the point here isnt that finland was uniquely evil it wasnt but that finns like irish people should face up to their states murky past
5395961 yes finland was ally of germany during the world war ii yes we handed 8 jews to germany yes we allowed germans to attack on soviet union from our soil were sorry sorry forgive us pleaaaaaaaase
5395962 you must admit this and that about alliance with germany
5395963 is improving the last key aspect of its ability to attack the u s the identification training and positioning of operatives for an attack in the homeland
5395964 that al qaeda cannot conduct large scale coordinated simultaneous operations on multiple targets of the scale of 9 11 anymore especially in the u s i base this on my own debriefing of al qaeda detainees
5395965 five years ago the nation rallied around a president who promised vengeance against those responsible for the atrocity of 9 11
5395966 in interviews saturday and sunday commission members said they were never told about the meeting despite hours of public and private questioning with ms rice mr tenet and mr black much of it focused specifically on how the white house dealt with terrorist threats in the summer of 2001
5395967 i hope our members and supporters will welcome yet another development towards enhancing our communications work we believe a new title clearly identifies both the organisational dynamic and marks the ultimate destination where we want to be we also believe the thematic approach which has already proven to be popular with our readers will continue providing added value for all who are interested and passionate about equality issues we are proud that the first edition of our magazine focuses on transgender peoples rights this edition provides a variety of articles covering many aspects of trans peoples lives and rights from stories of humiliation intrusion and abuse to stories of hope and inspiration
5395968 despite a challenging economic environment and significant increases in commodity costs we are achieving our strategic objective of becoming a growing and profitable digital company
5395969 the startup phase is behind us and we are now ready to put in place investments that will deliver higher volumes than previously planned in 2009
5395970 while theyre growing in digital cameras and inkjet printers theyre not making any money in those new businesses
5395971 thats the fundamental problem and it doesnt seem like theres much to change the profit outlook for the segment in the next six to 12 months
5395972 i will go as far as martin luther in that strong assertion of his where he says if any man doth ascribe of salvation even the very least to the free will of man he knoweth nothing of grace and he hath not learnt jesus christ aright it may seem a harsh sentiment but he who in his soul believes that man does of his own free will turn to god cannot have been taught of god for that is one of the first principles taught us when god begins with us that we have neither will nor power but that he gives both that he is alpha and omega in the salvation of men
5395973 does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth
5395974 that they did not cloth the poor feed the hungry visit the prisoners etc
5395975 the synod of dort adjudged arminianism a k a semi pelagianism to be heresy
5395976 but he who in his soul believes that man does of his own free will turn to god cannot have been taught of god for that is one of the first principles taught us when god begins with us that we have neither will nor power but that he gives both
5395977 scriptures do not consider a calvinist who dares to confront and refute him or her to not be acting in love
5395978 in conclusion the general issue is how important is truth and doctrine
5395979 scriptures deal with the issue of false teaching and the need to oppose refute and correct false teaching much much more than it deals with the issue of clothing the poor feeding the hungry and visiting the prisoners etc
5395980 tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine
5395981 the danger of making such an obvious statement that neither the three forms of unity nor westminster confession are in any way co equal with scripture is that such a statement tends to marginalize and minimize the importance of all creeds
5395982 tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine
5395983 jesus spent little to know time dealing with calvinism or arminianism or any other ism
5395984 i value learning from other professing christians but if all who disagree with your christian tradition are heretics it is difficult for any of us to learn from eachother
5395985 its not about accepting other views as true its about how we treat those with whom we have disagreements
5395986 dont ask me why we need to write a compiler in cobol im just a code monkey
5395987 its for people who like to post status updates about them doing everything from going to the bathroom to what theyre having for dinner
5395988 thats neat and all but duh ever heard of habbo hotel noob
5395989 you have to watch it it isnt that good but i am totally sucked in
5395990 capturing in detail the processes behind this large and surprisingly rapid transformation is a unique opportunity for understanding climate changes occurring elsewhere
5395991 this is our first airborne deployment of a powerful new suite of instruments in the arctic
5395992 when we analyze all the data well be able to piece together the equivalent of a high def movie of the atmosphere as springtime sunlight warms the region and sparks a chain of chemical reactions
5395993 the interesting aspect of digitization is not just how people access and use the information but how they network with others and create their own content
5395994 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
5395995 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports

5396067 there was a severe lack of oversight when it comes to incidents of sexual assault and harassment within the academies
5396068 its kind of hard to act on a problem when you dont know you have it or the extent of it
5396069 over the past year there have been increased requests for sexual assault data by dod leadership and lawmakers
5396070 we have full support of dod leadership and are moving forward to begin this project
5396071 we have spent a considerable amount of time trying to make sure that women who are usually the victims of sexual harassment feel welcome and feel safe at the academy

5396081 it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence
5396082 if we can show that we have significant oil reserves off our coasts that will clearly affect the futures market and affect the price of oil
5396083 if offshore drilling would provide short term relief at the pump or a long term strategy for energy independence it would be worthy of our consideration regardless of the risks

5396093 estamos en un momento en el que por la cantidad de futbolistas que hay en la plantilla hay que dar muchas salidas y nuestro principal objetivo es tratar de mantener a estos dos jugadores y recuperar a algunos de la pasada temporada que bien estaban pero no ofrecieron su mejor rendimiento o bien no estaban y este a o pueden ser muy importantes

5396145 all new ventures were established in the areas in which analysts specialized suggesting that analysts attempt to leverage sector specific skills in their entrepreneurial ventures
5396146 we believe that the decision to become an entrepreneur in a talent based occupation is closer to the idea of mastering the environment instead of triggered by the comfort of a wealthy position new ventures in a professional setting do not require great investment they require a great deal of personal confidence and client market understanding

5396164 i conclude that complete failure to publish a regulation or an integral part thereof in violation of article 254 ec constitutes a violation of an essential procedural requirement resulting at the very least in invalidity
5396165 it seems to me that the irregularity that taints regulation no 622 2003 as amended persistent and deliberate disregard of the mandatory publication requirements in article 254 2 ec in respect of the whole substance of the regulation is one whose gravity is so obvious that it cannot be tolerated by the community legal order

5396182 the collaboration with 24 other public water users is significant and we appreciate their cooperation and participation in moving from voluntary conservation to mandatory water restrictions
5396183 some people are already conserving and we want them to continue but the call today is for more people to conserve and to follow the mandatory conservation requirements in their communities it makes a difference and buys the region time until rain arrives
5396184 it was a classical mccain move dissing us by going behind our backs
5396185 he turned down repeated cpac offers to speak but then tried to get around us by having his office call the hotel to rent a room for a reception for cpac attendees without first seeking approval of cpac organizers
5396186 called us a long time ago to arrange for a hospitality reception he will give for cpac attendees
5396187 we would have still allowed mccain to do something at cpac but by the time his folks approached the hotel everything was in concrete and there was no facility available for what he wanted

5396189 reagan attended every cpac from the first one in 1974 when he gave his famous city upon a hill speech until his last year in office in 1988
5396190 the exceptions were 1976 and 1980 when he was campaigning in new hampshire for the gop nomination
5396191 the very first cpac reagan brought as his guest a young severely wounded navy pilot who had been a pow in hanoi john mccain iii
5396192 are the people who knock on doors for candidates they support and make up the core of the ground troops on whom any candidate has to rely
5396193 by simply dismissing them as senator mccain has done he is telling them more about himself than perhaps he wants them to know
5396194 mccain alienates the left by calling for the repeal of the roe v wade decision but he then alienates the right by dissing their organizations refusing to speak at the recent national review conference the house republican study committee retreat and now cpac
5396195 any gop politician who doesnt understand this and the importance of this conference doesnt understand conservatism
5396196 most conservatives disagree with his positions on a number of issues like campaign finance reform gun show loopholes taxes and global warming
5396197 but many like his stand on earmarks and his support of president bush on iraq and almost all respect the sacrifices he made for his country during the vietnam era

5396253 i can guarantee you that there are people in the bush administration who are studying the use of surveillance technologies being developed here and have at least skeletal plans to implement them at home
5396254 we can already see it in new york with cctv cameras once you have the cameras in place you have the infrastructure for a powerful tracking system im worried about what this will mean if the u s government goes totalitarian and starts employing these technologies more than they are already im worried about the threat this poses to american democracy

5396275 your site must be able to withstand a very sophisticated group of consumers that will be online in droves this holiday season theres so much competition out there that you only get one chance

5396283 there are at least 200 reasons why the next election for president of the united states is going to be a critical one and the most important one that we have in our history now i know we say that all the time that every presidential election is the most important one that we have in our history but actually its a truthful statement isnt it because every presidential election the next one is the most important because it determines the future course of this country there are a lot of issues there are a lot of differences but im going to give you 200 reasons why the next election is really important its the 200 federal judges that the next president of the united states will likely appoint over four years in the white house thats roughly the average that a president gets to appoint
5396284 the common and systematic abuse of our federal courts by the people we entrust with judicial power
5396285 would serve as the model for my own nominees if that responsibility falls to me
5396286 elections have consequences one of the consequences is the president of the united states gets to name his or her nominees to the bench
5396287 the constitution can be interpreted in so many ways and one way is a cramped and narrow way in which the constitution and the courts essentially become rubber stamps for the powerful in society and then there is another vision of the court that says that the courts are the refuge of the powerless because often times they may lose in the democratic back and forth they may be locked out prevented from fully participating in the democratic process
5396288 the next president wont be in a position to make this a liberal court but he can prevent it from becoming reactionary and moving to unreviewable executive power

5396293 w hat the cross points to is the very thing that seems to stand in the way of realizing who you are
5396294 i thought jesus came died on the cross that jesus being here was about his death and dying on the cross when it really was about him coming to show us how to do it how to be to show us the christ consciousness that he had and that that consciousness abides with all of us
5396295 the symbolic significance of the cross is changed from being a torture instrument to a symbol of the divine
5396296 t he very suffering that comes with being here in this physical realm because eventually some form of suffering comes to everybody can become an opening into that which we call the divine

5396341 hadley expresses temperature changes in terms of deviations from the 1961 to 1990 average in 2002 the rounded global temperature for land and sea was 0 46 above that average in the next five years it was 0 46 0 43 0 48 0 42 and 0 40 the figures for the date centre are calculated slightly differently but they too show no trend over the period in question what does this mean some global warming sceptics say these figures disprove the basic hypothesis of global warming that rising greenhouse gas emissions automatically produce rising temperatures some have looked back to 1998 an unusually hot year 0 52 on hadleys list and said that global warming actually stopped back then they conclude that after 10 years we can now say global warming is over and we face the possibility of global cooling
5396342 what duffy did is look at his data and try to find a way of presenting it that appeared to support his pre selected conclusion and he managed to find one he didnt show a complete analysis he couldnt because a complete analysis would have refuted his argument so he selectively chose a way of analyzing the data that would produce the desired results he looked at the data to find the longest period where trend analysis would show what he wanted and he stopped there
5396343 the study will focus in particular on short lived pollutants that may be contributing to the accelerated warming in the arctic relative to the global average warming

5396359 thank you for inviting me here to washington to share my views on how we can work together to slow stop and eventually reverse this countrys greenhouse gas emissions
5396360 one of my first jobs after law school was as a consumer advocate in kentucky i challenged rate increases proposed by utility companies in the 1970s
5396361 today i am here as an advocate for duke energys 4 million electricity customers in five states in the midwest and carolinas these customers rely upon coal fired generation for 70 percent of their electricity
5396362 i am also here to advocate for the tens of millions of electricity customers in the 25 states where more than 50 percent of their electricity is generated using coal to address climate change we must have a bridge to a low carbon economy to
5396363 a cap and trade program with appropriate allocation of allowances will protect consumers as we develop technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
5396364 in 1990 congress provided a similar bridge when it passed the clean air act amendments legislation that has dramatically reduced sulfur dioxide emissions this bridge has been a transition mechanism of allowance allocations
5396365 as ceo of a legacy duke company in indiana in 1989 i advocated for so2 cap and trade legislation
5396366 during this period we were given permission to emit so2 from our existing generation fleet this allowed us to use these plants to produce electricity while advanced emissions technology was developed and installed
5396367 as demand grew we purchased allowances to serve our customers also over time as our allocation was reduced we purchased additional allowances
5396368 while customers bore the cost of buying these allowances and paying for so2 retrofits the cap and trade program protected them from major rate shock and unnecessary economic harm
5396369 some have suggested that co2 allowances should be auctioned but an auction approach would unfairly and disproportionately harm regions that depend on coal especially the 25 states in the midwest southeast and great plains
5396370 forcing customers in these regions to bear the cost of buying allowances for existing plants while at the same time bearing the cost of retrofitting and replacing existing plants would result in a double hit paying twice for the bridge
5396371 additionally it is unfair to allocate allowances based on megawatt hour output as some suggest this would give permits to power plants such as nuclear or hydro that have no co2 emissions these plants were conceived and built decades ago long before anyone raised carbon concerns
5396372 duke energy is the nations third largest coal generator fourth largest nuclear generator and is planning to build two new nuclear units
5396373 from our perspective there is simply no economic justification to give allowances to nuclear and hydro plants that will not incur any costs to comply with the program
5396374 doing so would be like giving these companies a printing press to make money at the expense of other regions of our country there is no justification for such a windfall
5396375 it is also important for us to acknowledge that if we are not serious about building more nuclear generation in this country then we are not serious about climate change
5396376 nuclear energy has a demonstrated safety record it is efficient and economical and the basic technology is available today there is no way that we can realistically attain significant levels of carbon reduction and achieve our countrys economic goals without expanding its use

5396378 the toll on women and girls presents africa and the world with a practical and moral challenge which places gender at the center of the human condition the practice of ignoring gender analysis has turned out to be lethal what has happened to women is a gross and palpable violation of human rights
5396379 women and girls are vulnerable to aids not because of their individual behavior but because of the discrimination and violence they face the unequal power relations even being married is a risk factor for women female hiv infections are on the rise in asia eastern europe and latin america as well as in africa and aids is the leading cause of death for 25 34 year old african american women in the united states only by addressing the needs and human rights of women and ensuring their full participation will we change the course of this disease
5396380 the key question is whether african leaders and elite are ready to make hard choices that would slow down the rate of infections among women the key is to focus on practical solutions to a problem that can only get worse if nothing is done

5396406 today bill donohue issued a set of frivolous comments on rev michael pflegers recent inappropriate remarks about hillary clinton instead of focusing on the nature of pflegers remarks mr donohue chose the unfortunate path of using the incident to question the character of sen barack obama catholics united is concerned that donohues comments appear part of a systematic campaign to influence the outcome of the upcoming presidential election by maligning sen obama to catholic voters
5396407 this pattern of partisan rhetoric is nothing new to the catholic league under the leadership of mr donohue donohue has targeted senator obama and his advisors in recent months over similarly petty issues earlier this year he let john mccain off easy over an endorsement from the anti catholic john hagee while in 2007 he vowed to make john edwards hiring of two anti catholic junior staffers the central issue of the election in 2004 donohue pursued a relentless campaign to challenge the credibility of democratic presidential candidate sen john kerry by painting him as a bad catholic and we know from deal hudsons book onward christian soldiers that donohue participated in at least one campaign meeting with karl rove during the run up to the 2000 election
5396408 catholics united wholeheartedly supports the catholic leagues noble mission of defending the right of catholics lay and clergy alike to participate in american public life without defamation or discrimination it is difficult however to understand how donohues own political activity as catholic league president is consistent with this mission or the organizations 501 c 3 nonprofit tax status
5396409 we are also concerned that donohues media profile risks creating an appearance of partisanship on the part of the entire catholic community although he often seems to pretend otherwise mr donohue has absolutely no authority to speak for catholics or the church institution

5396457 the biggest decision we had to make was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged wtc 7 building a number of fire officers and companies assessed the damage to the building the appraisals indicated that the buildings integrity was in serious doubt
5396458 the most important operational decision to be made that afternoon was that the collapse of the wtc towers had damaged 7 world trade center which is about a 50 story building at vesey between west broadway and washington street it had very heavy fire on many floors and i ordered the evacuation of an area sufficient around to protect our members so we had to give up some rescue operations that were going on at the time and back the people away far enough so that if 7 world trade did collapse we wouldnt lose any more people we continued to operate on what we could from that distance and approximately an hour and a half after that order was given at 5 30 in the afternoon 7 world trade center collapsed completely

5396485 let us try to remember how fancy works in children with what selective partiality it reads leaving often the bulk of the book unrealised but fixing on the rest and living it and what a passionate impotence it shows what power of adoption what weakness to create it seems to be not much otherwise with uneducated readers they long not to enter into the lives of others but to behold themselves in changed situations ardently but impotently preconceived the imagination save the mark of the popular author here comes to the rescue supplies some body of circumstance to these phantom aspirations and conducts the readers where they will where they will thats the point elsewhere they will not follow when i was a child if i came on a book in which the characters wore armour it fell from my hand i had no criterion of merit simply that one decisive taste that my fancy refused to linger in the middle ages and the mind of the uneducated reader is mailed with similar restrictions so it is that we must account for a thing otherwise unaccountable the popularity of some of these great ones of the dust in defect of any other gift they have instinctive sympathy with the popular mind they can thus supply to the shop girl and the shoe black vesture cut to the pattern of their naked fancies and furnish them with welcome scenery and properties for autobiographical romancing even in readers of an upper class we may perceive the traces of a similar hesitation even for them a writer may be too exotic the villain even the heroine may be a feejee islander but only on condition the hero is one of ourselves

5396522 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
5396523 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
5396524 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
5396525 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
5396526 likewise i see no reason why the list of books determined to be canonical or the doctrine of sola scriptura itself cannot be such items of knowledge arrived at by sound arguments and the use of god given reason
5396527 thus you are basing your argument for what is the highest authority on a different authority
5396528 the doctrine may not be stated in one sentence but it was developed because the saints found reason s within scripture to think a certain way have you read yeagos article on theological interpretation im going this direction in a sense in other words we dont have a full blown doctrine of the trinity in scripture but those who helped develop it saw scripture thinking a certain way about god because of jesus and the holy spirit and they continued down that road
5396529 as a side note its worth pointing out that whatever can be said in favor of church infallibility can likewise be said in favor of the infallibility of scripture and whatever can be said against the doctrine of sola scriptura can likewise be said against the infallibility of the church
5396530 the word of god alone is the final authority in all matters of christian faith and practice
5396531 hold fast to the traditions that you have been taught whether orally or by letter
5396532 furthermore why was the church seen as so authoritative in the early church they had bishops who knew or were trained by the apostles and therefore kept the tradition s of interpretation alive among other important things but again why were these bishops authoritative i believe this is because their interpretations were handed down from the apostles themselves or those who knew them and the apostles beliefs were based on scripture
5396533 if i have good reason to believe based on the best evidence both historical and logical that the bible in its final canonized form is the infallible word of god and moreover if i likewise have good reason to believe based on the best evidence that no other earthly institution bears the mark of divine infallibility then sola scriptura follows quite naturally
5396534 so are you all saying that doctrinal differences dont matter
5396535 you talk of good reason but where is the reason in the fact that the
5396536 you have rightly pointed out a need for an infallible interpreter but is that necessarily any human
5396537 the disciples werent sent out as infallible interpreters they were sent out as very very good ministers by the infallible one himself
5396538 what is the source of the people in both cases
5396539 but belong body and soul to our lord and savior jesus christ
5396540 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me jesus
5396541 go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i christ have commanded you
5396542 whats good for you may not be good for me
5396543 believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved
5396544 how can one be sure he has the correct interpretation
5396545 questions like baptism and which creeds we use are small concerns in the grand scheme of things
5396546 i will believe x y and z but will reject a b and c
5396547 dont confuse me with the facts my mind is already made up
5396548 to read deeply into history is the cease being protestant
5396549 not 100 people hate the church but millions hate what they mistakenly believe to be the catholic church
5396550 however the main problem i have is that all the attributes for an infallible interpretive authority pope and magisterium you by
5396551 i will believe x y and z but will reject a b and c
5396552 i will believe a and reject x because best reason tells me to
5396553 i will believe a and reject x because i am an infallible interpreter
5396554 not one proponent of ss has cited one scripture or church father as an argument in favor of the doctrine of sola scriptura
5396555 there has been a bunch of rhetoric and arguments about
5396556 i am not relying on my own intellect because it is flawed i am relying on the promise of christ that the holy spirit will guide his church in all truth
5396557 again this brings us back to the original question that you have yet to answer how can one be sure he has the correct interpretation
5396558 uncertainty is an unfortunate reality of this world fallibility is an unfortunate essence of our creatureliness the natural discomfort and tension generated by the very question dave c continually raises is evidence of the longing for the eternal which rests in the hearts of men it is one of the curses of living in the already not yet times we inhabit we must simply do the best we can and like the bereans continually return to scripture to test everything that we hear
5396559 you may not have explicitly condoned relativism or defined the chuirch as a dismembered body but your acceptance of the disunity implicitly condones that former and defines the latter
5396560 if you believe that all christian denominations are following the truth as they understand it and you are
5396561 whats good for you may not be good for me
5396562 basically god did all the creating christ did some of the saving and the hs is the waterboy for now empowered man
5396563 we must simply do the best we can and like the bereans continually return to scripture to test everything that we hear
5396564 look at the damnation that john holds out in revelation for adding or subtracting one thing from scripture
5396565 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me jesus
5396566 i can know i have the correct interpretation just like i can know anything else
5396567 does this give me 100 certainty that i am correct no and that is why i humbly allow for the possibility that those who disagree with me may in fact be right
5396568 yet those things which are necessary to be known believed and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of scripture or other that not only the learned but the unlearned in a due use of the ordinary means may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them
5396569 those things which are necessary to be known believed and observed for salvation
5396570 are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of scripture
5396571 the whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends whether something is proposed for belief for hope or for action the love of our lord must always be made accessible so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love
5396572 stand firm in one spirit with one mind struggling together for the faith of the gospel
5396573 1 i am asking that you extend me the same consideration that i may in fact be correct according to your rubric my stance has just as much of a possibility of being correct as yours in fact i would argue that i have more of a chance of being correct
5396574 2 how can you say that scripture interpretation can be known the same way that one can know anything else truth is truth we can know for sure that a pizza is a pizza there is no option that it may be something else i dont need to look at all the arguments and based on my flawed logic come to a conclusion
5396575 what you are really saying is that there is in fact no way to be sure
5396576 yet those things which are necessary to be known believed and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of scripture or other that not only the learned but the unlearned in a due use of the ordinary means may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them
5396577 however i struggle with the notion that god has revealed truth to us but according to your estimation there really is no way for us to know it for sure
5396578 so far we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in
5396579 when officers went there they said it was like stepping into a place frozen in time
5396580 the cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades nothing had been disturbed for decades even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there

5396618 undisturbed birth is exceedingly rare in our culture even in birth centers and homebirths two factors that disturb birth in all mammals are firstly being in an unfamiliar place and secondly the presence of an observer feelings of safety and privacy thus seem to be fundamental some writers have observed that for a woman having a baby has a lot of parallels with making a baby same hormones same parts of the body same sounds and the same needs for feelings of safety and privacy how would it be to attempt to make love in the conditions under which we expect women to give birth

5396625 seem to expect that km practices are less explicitly related to competitiveness than what one would expect
5396626 do not anticipate concrete results that are consistent with the competitive advantage potential associated to firm specific knowledge
5396627 the kind of km initiatives that managers talk about and the kind of results that they seem to expect from them are also less consistent with that competitiveness potential

5396635 bill donohue criticizes catholics that dont agree with bill donohue nothing more to question whether someone is catholic because they dont agree with you is simply wrong and is a page straight out of karl roves playbook
5396636 ironically the catholic league for religious and civil rights pays bill donohue over 343 000 a year to defend the rights of catholics lay and clergy alike to participate in american public life without defamation or discrimination

5396865 thursday afternoon searchers said they received a signal from one of the black boxes of the airliner crews will not be able to retrieve the black box which could contain information about the last minutes of the plane until they are able to enter the collapsed area of the building where the planes fuselage rests they were to begin moving into the collapsed area sometime thursday night said arlington county fire capt scott mckay
5396866 spotted an intact seat from the planes cockpit with a chunk of the floor still attached
5396867 we discovered cockpit wreckage at our feet while attempting to rescue people from a navy operations area
5396868 shaeffer stood on a service road that circled the pentagon between the b and c rings a chunk of the 757s nose cone and front landing gear lay on the pavement a few feet away resting against the b ring wall
5396869 in the last 10 minutes or so they started a second evacuation of the pentagon area were told that theres another aircraft thats been hijacked and its 20 minutes outside washington d c
5396870 there was a report of an inbound aircraft so we had to evacuate we had to shut down everything and we moved to the other side of washington boulevard
5396871 once they confirmed that the threat was no longer a threat about the time the plane crashed in pennsylvania then we went back to work
5396872 a dark grey plume of smoke rises from the south side of the pentagon building normally the symbol of american power a few hundred metres away rich brown cowers behind a low stone wall a snapshot of fear as terrorism brings the world superpower to its knees
5396873 we have just been told theres a helicopter with a hijacker and we have been told to get away
5396874 right as we were getting in the ambulance they announced there was a second plane inbound very scary moment there
5396875 theres another plane 20 minutes out we dont know if its hijacked or not but its not responding so it probably is
5396876 ok 20 minutes lets see who else they can get out
5396877 oh 20 miles is a big difference a plane could cover 20 miles pretty quick
5396878 we cant confirm that were told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that they did it
5396879 the width of the severe damage to the west facade of the pentagon was approximately 120 ft from column lines 8 to 20
5396880 about 96 feet wide across the first floor about 18 feet wide across the second floor about 26 feet high at the center
5396881 why isnt there more video without telling too much of what i know of pentagon security you would be surprised how few cameras there are outside the building humans actively patrolling a buildings perimeter are a tad more effective than dozens of monitors which may or may not be watched at any given moment
5396882 the secret service and customs had teamed up in atlanta to provide some rudimentary air defense against an aircraft flying into the olympic stadium they did so again during the subsequent national security special events and they agreed to create a permanent air defense unit to protect washington unfortunately those two federal law enforcement agencies were housed in the treasury department and its leadership did not want to pay for such a mission or run the liability risks of shooting down the wrong aircraft treasury nixed the air defense unit and my attempts within the white house to overrule them came to naught the idea of aircraft attacking in washington seemed remote to many people and the risks of shooting down aircraft in a city were thought to be far too high moreover the opponents of our plan argued the air force could always scramble fighter aircraft to protect washington if there were a problem on occasions when aircraft were hijacked and in one case when we erroneously believed a northwest flight had been seized the air force did intercept the airliners with fighter jets we succeeded only in getting secret service the permission to continue to examine air defense options including the possibility of placing missile units near the white house most people who heard about our efforts to create some air defense system in case terrorists tried to fly aircraft into the capitol the white house or the pentagon simply thought we were nuts

5396886 jothi yang baru saja terbentuk pada 9 juli 2008 memang memiliki visi dan misi untuk mengkritisi dan memberikan advokasi terhadap kasus diskriminasi atau pengenaan stigma terhadap pengidap hiv
5396887 sesuai visi kami yakni penegakan ham untuk orang yang terinfeksi hiv tanpa stigma dan diskriminasi
5396888 memang jumlah diskriminasi sudah jauh berkurang termasuk dalam pelayanan kesehatan namun memang harus diakui masih ada itu karena masih ada tenaga medis yang belum paham mengenai penanganan pasien yang mengidap hiv
5396889 saya pernah ke poliklinik gigi dan menyatakan status saya yang mengidap hiv nyatanya saya dilempar ke sana dan sini sebelum diperiksa gigi saya
5396890 jejaring orang orang yang terinfeksi hiv perlu diperkuat untuk ikut dalam penanggulangan dan pencegahan hiv aids
5396891 beberapa masalah lain adalah lemahnya program program penanggulangan aids oleh lembaga donor belum adanya sinergi program dan pendanaan lemahnya kendali hukum dalam membela posisi orang yang terinfeksi hiv pemanfaatan kelompok orang terinfeksi hiv sebagai alat untuk mendapat pendanaan oleh lembaga swadaya masyarakat tertentu
5396892 sampai akhir tahun 2006 belum ada jaringan yang dibutuhkan untuk mengisi tempat itu jejaring itu baru terbentuk pada 9 juli lalu
5396893 jadi meskipun arv nya gratis tapi kalau terlambat datang bisa bahaya bagi penderita aids
5396894 saat ini timbul kekhawatiran di antara rekan rekan yang sudah mengikuti terapi arv atas menipisnya persediaan obat tersebut padahal obat tersebut sangat besar artinya bagi orang yang hidup dengan hiv
5396895 bila sampai terlambat meminumnya akan menjadi resistance kebal dan harus naik ke obat lini dua yang lebih mahal
5396896 obat arv yang ditaruh di dinkes minimal merupakan persediaan arv selama enam bulan
5396897 aids is not only a health problem it has become a social and cultural issue because of the stigma and discrimination against infected people
5396898 we want to be more than just a symbol in a counseling or discussion session on hiv aids we want to be involved to fulfill our rights as human beings
5396899 we appreciate the establishment of jothi because our efforts in tackling hiv aids have yet to yield significant results we need to cooperate with the key population the people living with hiv aids so they can also play vital roles in the issue
5396900 hiv aids patients still get rejected by health workers in hospitals and clinics
5396901 hopefully through jothi we can get easier access to antiretroviral drugs by lobbying the parties responsible for the procurement of the drugs and so ensure a continuous supply
5396902 the drugs are crucial we need to keep taking them for the rest of our lives unfortunately it is very difficult to get an uninterrupted supply

5397687 turned out to be one of the hardest things i have ever done
5397688 i will continue to paddle long distances for sure but the format of the big moo canoe will evolve into a more approachable family and or paddling club focused event next time
5397689 we had so many people who wanted to paddle along this year logistically i just did not have a large enough crew to mix the 250 mile challenge and try to keep track of other participants
5397690 next year we have contemplated having a saturday event packed with river related activities and races that would culminate in a free heifer themed party at the saratoga river park with a free band i will work with my denver based canoeing contacts to try to get them to host a 5 and 10 mile race and also have a 10 mile family flotilla the evening party will be designed to offer an alternative for our non boating friends who still want to enjoy the day and learn about heifer
5397691 many parents are very worried about their children who are well past the marrying age many singles are feeling pressured by their parents
5397692 i had so many parents coming in asking for advice that i started a little party for them to get together and discuss their problems
5397693 people who can marry for love are lucky for others its more difficult matchmaking is not about passionately falling in love its about slowly growing to love someone
5397694 if you are pushed out of your home and forced to take care of yourself as young people are in europe and the united states it is natural to think of doing so with another person to make your load easier
5397695 baby boomer era parents in their 50s and 60s grew up and worked in the bubble economy and they do not fully understand that young people are less likely to be hired as a full time worker nowadays
5397696 parents with single daughters keep on looking for high earning husbands
5397697 they want someone who is handsome and with a very good income there are mothers who come to meetings looking for a man who earns up to 10 million yen 92 650 annually
5397698 i come to these parties to find someone for my daughter but she is difficult to please
5397699 we created the comodo forum hoping that it would evolve into a strong knit community that consisted of both our customers and others interested in online security

5397701 rescinding health care coverage is a serious action placing the enrollee at financial risk for the full amount of billed medical charges and potentially rendering the enrollee uninsurable
5397702 blue cross has a rigorous and thoughtful process it follows in every case where rescission review occurs because health insurance is so critically important to each and every one of our members
5397703 a 1 million fine for 100 cases makes business sense for blue cross because of the profit levels of the company
5397704 blue cross is reaping millions in savings by not paying for care

5397707 cork trees can live up to 600 years but you kill them by taking the bark off
5397708 this is the biggest violation of the cease fire in the last five years
5397709 more research needs to be done to confirm these results especially since it was a small study
5397710 but these results should also get the attention of women with migraine and their doctors since topiramate is also used for preventing migraine which is an even more common condition that also occurs frequently in women of childbearing age
5397711 all women should clearly understand the risks and benefits of their therapy
5397712 until more information is available topiramate use in women who plan on conceiving should be restricted to those in whom the drug is definitely needed for seizure control or other indications also the mother should be informed of the potential risks to her child
5397713 women with epilepsy if they depend on this drug to control their convulsive seizures they should definitely continue it
5397714 if they are taking it for migraine prevention chances are they would want to discontinue it before conception

5397717 the earliest work yta ii 1985 takes its title from the swedish word for surface hes written a series of three yta s for different instruments written mostly in the 1980s for friends while he was still based in finland he writes in his notes about how surfaces for a finn are often snow covered and can appear either blurry as in a blizzard or clean and sparkling as in ice that imagery appears in the music i also find a great deal of humor in yta ii and cant help but imagine a high strung little creature that goes through a transformation into something rich and beautiful by the end of the piece
5397718 dichotomie the major piece by salonen on this disc was composed in 1999 2000 the first movement m canisme is just a romp and ive confided to esa pekka that i find this movement to be all about misbehaving laughter its like a kid who insists on jumping on the bed and making all sorts of trouble but every so often has to come back and behave and does so with passages of great eloquence
5397719 the last of the three invenzione a due voci is the hardest piece ive ever laid eyes on with two independent lines that are parallel and yet not unrelenting gnarly and requiring a sound that is completely effortless and relaxed

5397725 these findings will be very concerning to these adept marketing companies as it demonstrates the risk to the value of their brands clearly they are not connecting with their local marketplaces as well as they could
5397726 this is why we are currently developing a brand barometer together with gmi to allow companies to monitor on a regular basis how they are perceived around the world they can then act on the insights about their brand perceptions and implement more focused local marketing programs

5397734 the g8 promotion of the development of open and efficient agricultural and food markets has denied poor people the chance to feed themselves today it treats food as a mere commodity
5397735 the g8 also seem to be pressing for a quick fix trade negotiations which we believe would be devastating no deal is better than a bad deal
5397736 tragically market driven development one of the principle causes of the present food crisis appears to be the solution offered by the present g8 leaders this is appalling
5397737 the rhetorical commitment on the mdgs as expressed in this communiqu are shown hollow when the g8 has not been able to come up with a solution to mdg1 dealing with hunger
5397738 we were desperate to see an end to market speculation from the g8 but there is nothing in there
5397739 there is no urgency in the 2050 emissions target we wanted a clear baseline for this and a 2020 target not a deadline thats set for when these leaders will be consigned to history
5397740 the g8 insistence on passing the climate investment funds solution is worse the than problem the institution the world bank which has been mainly responsible for destroying the climate cannot be charged with managing the fund its like cleaning the floor with a dirty cloth
5397741 the g8 want a sectoral approach but its doomed because it doesnt acknowledge the effect on women and marginalised groups it wont have a positive impact on the lives of poor people
5397742 the journey to school for the worlds poorest people has been set in slow motion whilst we welcome the pledge of 1 billion to education its less than 10 of what they ought to pay for everyone to have a quality education
5397743 hopes for a breakthrough in the global sanitation and water crisis were dashed as the g8 delivered a communiqu largely devoid of concrete actions to help the 2 6 billion lacking access to a safe toilet and 1 1 bilion people lacking access to clean water
5397744 the reiteration of past commitments to developing countries 50 billlion are welcome but the g8 continues to use deliberately loose language that ties them to no binding commitments
5397745 most disturbing is that the new timeframe for delivering the 60 billion on health has stretched to 5 years meaning the net worth is reduced significantly
5397746 this g8 communiqu is a statement of aspirations and wishful thinking more than any concrete commitment being put on the table at this crucial mid point in the mdgs its not acceptable when many parts of africa and asia are lagging so far behind
5397747 one of the problems with the g8 is that all the decisions are taken by consensus so the final communiqu s end up being the least common denominator position the worst positions on each issue are the ones that end up being adopted
5397748 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go
5397749 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5397750 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5397751 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the authenticity hes not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5397752 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5397753 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5397754 i think what hes trying to do is create a bigger body image maybe he uses bigger shoulder pads but i think it makes him look smaller
5397755 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5397756 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5397757 i know its not my place but on a hot day like this that dog should be at home
5397758 i am devastated i am very worried that such incidents will make parents very scared to send their children to school
5397759 this has worked quite a bit when the insurgents see that the local community is protecting the school they usually dont challenge
5397760 when i went to the school in logar to meet parents after the recent attack the first thing that they told me was please do not close the school down
5397761 how much can villagers do in fighting armed insurgents it is ultimately the governments responsibility to secure its children

5397767 two of probably the top five defensemen that were entering free agency
5397768 they kind of raised me in the nhl and i definitely couldnt see myself playing anywhere else you can go to free agency and see whats out there but i really did not have the desire to do that
5397769 were going to prepare ourselves to ice the best team possible with the hope that some time in the upcoming weeks or months that hell decide to come back
5397770 but if he doesnt were going to be ready for that eventuality
5397771 one of the luxuries that we have i think in peter budaj we have a very capable goaltender
5397772 we know that we have an insurance policy that we felt pretty comfortable about were not going to overpay in our mind to re sign theodore
5397773 we would like to get another goaltender of quality to come in i imagine the scenario would be that peter and another guy would come in but i would think peter would be the guy kind of with the reins but we wouldnt mind if theres a challenge there
5397774 if we cant get jeff done well see what direction we go from there

5397823 more than 1 billion people today are between 15 and 25 years of age and nearly 40 per cent of the worlds population is below the age of 20 eighty five per cent of these young people live in developing countries where many are especially vulnerable to extreme poverty
5397824 he asked us if we did we held up our cards that say i do he pronounced us man and wife then we took off our regulators and we kissed
5397825 i presented the idea to christina on tuesday and we got married on friday
5397826 the more we planned the more excited we got about getting married underwater
5397827 were both previously married with kids and we were thinking why do we want to have a traditional wedding
5397828 christinas family was a little nervous about it because shes still a novice at diving
5397829 i told her cant you get married like normal people
5397830 game shows are a great business model because the math just makes so much sense
5397831 weve heard of one hour dramas typically costing between 3 million and 5 million while these game shows can be produced at the network level in the 700 000 and up range
5397832 plus a typical drama is shot over multiple days while we can sometimes shoot two and three episodes of a game show in one day you can do the math
5397833 what youre seeing from this most recent crop of game shows is that in order to connect with network audiences the shows have to be cranked up a couple of notches its not just about being the most cost effective
5397834 with the added competition now you have to make them bigger and sexier
5397835 we already used models in deal so we wanted to evolve things and since show me the money is at abc the network that brought us dancing with the stars we thought that using dancers would be a nice tie in with their brand
5397836 when you look at the audience for these 8 oclock game shows what you see is that instead of everyone in the family going to their separate tv sets in the house its that one time when teenagers are watching with their younger brothers and sisters and watching with their moms and dads
5397837 no ones ever programmed anything original on christmas day this way but these shows lend themselves so well to such event programming for those times when the whole family is watching
5397838 as terrific as game shows are in terms of cost effectiveness and flexibility in scheduling they also notoriously have a short shelf life
5397839 it remains to be seen where this latest cycle that started with deal or no deal will go
5397840 but every show that has come down the pike in the previous cycle who wants to be a millionaire weakest link greed and 21 had a life cycle in prime time of a year and half at most i love them theyre great and i hope rich list is a hit but history says dont bet the whole bank on them
5397841 even where astrology is explicit in lewiss work it has received surprisingly little attention
5397842 he was not prepared to write off a view of the cosmos as his schoolmasters had written off paganism simply because it had been shown to be factually inadequate ideas could be entertained for their beauty not just their truth
5397843 the characters of the planets as conceived by medieval astrology seem to me to have a permanent value as spiritual symbols to provide a which is specially worth while in our own generation
5397844 i am religious and i am a priest but i am not doing this to convert people to christ to faith or the church but for them to try to understand life to be able to enjoy it nothing more
5397845 this pilot program will be extremely helpful by applying military capabilities to support ongoing civilian efforts in preserving and protecting valuable marine resources found in the sanctuaries
5397846 we hope that this is the beginning of a long standing relationship with noaa we can provide noaa with needed engineer diving support and they provide us with real world missions to keep the u s army dive company trained and ready for deployment around the world in support of the global war on terror
5397847 i would like a better split also but i think it is reasonable
5397848 it would be three four times what manny has ever made i think worldwide manny is more popular than mayweather i dont think it would do two million but it would be very close we all know oscar is the draw
5397849 the only reason im taking this fight is because manny can win it
5397850 it puts him at a new level and a level he wants to be at i know we would have to fight a perfect fight to do it but i know he is capable of doing that
5397851 if we dont fight de la hoya they want to fight soto
5397852 i say soto the pound for pound best guy fighting soto that doesnt do much business if manny doesnt fight oscar i think he should sit out and fight ricky hatton next year
5397853 i think the oscar deal is a no lose situation and i strongly feel manny can win the fight and if he doesnt win the fight he doesnt have to pay me
5397854 first time vernon underestimated him and i think this time he is not going to do that this is like do or die for vernon
5397855 is he mora a possibility yes frankly so are a lot of other guys just about everybody you could think of is calling me and trying to make a case for their guy being the best opponent for de la hoya

5397894 squibs horizontal puffs of smoke and debris are observed emerging from wtc 7 in regular sequence just as the building starts to collapse see http tinyurl com 7drxn yet the floors have not moved relative to one another yet as one can verify from the videos so air expulsion due to collapsing floors is excluded i have personally examined many building demolitions based on on line videos and the presence of such squibs firing in rapid sequence as observed is prima facie evidence for the use of pre positioned explosives inside the building i conclude that the evidence for pre positioned explosives in wtc 7 also in towers 1 and 2 is truly compelling

5397927 that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
5397928 because of simple math the five extra combat brigades which were deployed to iraq with the surge each have 15 month tours of duty the 15 months will be up in july and the u s army and marines have no combat brigades ready to replace them

5397944 there is no scientific basis for the conclusion that explosions brought down the towers that representation of our work is categorically incorrect and not in context
5397945 several demolition teams had reached ground zero by 3 00 pm on 9 11 and these individuals witnessed the collapse of wtc 7 from within a few hundred feet of the event
5397946 we were all standing around helpless we knew full well it was going to collapse everyone there knew you gotta remember there was a lot of confusion and we didnt know if another plane was coming but i never heard explosions like demo charges we knew with the damage to the building and how hot the fire was that building was gonna go so we just waited and a little later it went
5397947 engineers later discovered that the building survived the fire with surprisingly limited structural damage credit was given to especially thick layers of a relatively heavy cementlike fireproofing that had been applied to structural steel the world trade center had the much lighter easily dislodged fireproofing on the floor braces whose failure probably initiated the collapse

5397986 mark roberts deserves to die a traitors sic death for trying to suppress 9 11 families from seeking the truth
5397987 mark roberts does deserve to die a traitors death i will not apologize for it this time i will be there for his death should america fall into civil war that is not a threat that is a promise if he gets in my way of defending our constitution it will be my pleasure to put a bullet in his head to defend our constitution from enemies foreign or domestic
5397988 when the truth comes out that mark roberts twat deserves to be executed certainly not for being a danger to the movements progress but just for being an inherently loathesome bile inducing shill twat hes a dirty shill and all shills will be covered in piss and petrol and shot when the truth comes out
5397989 merry kristmas gravy you slimy treacherous shill sorry the present is a bit late but its the thot wot counts

5397992 dylans headline saying hes cia wouldnt surprise me mark roberts seems to be a genius on all the facts
5397993 mark roberts is either the most ignorant gullible person in the world or an agent and considering hes a grown man that should have a wife and kids and you know a hobby of some kind besides harassing us im going with agent mark roberts has nothing on this movement he never has and he never will and he knows that deep inside thats why he results to attacking our character and insinuating

5397995 the man was a ringer for robert de niro only taller and younger les speculated he was his brother he looked so much like him you couldnt believe he could be merely a nephew or son
5397996 scholars for 9 11 truth creator of the conspiracy video
5397997 this interview is to allow you to hear the government story by a slick professional true cointelpro roberts roberts who is
5397998 if mark roberts is a person let him identify himself and provide background about himself and his many sources if not a person then let the group identify itself and its many sources until then i urge you to pull the link any link unless the source can be reasonably verified as being who or what it purports to be
5397999 anna marky write only lies that is all they have that is all the bushiebot apologist shills have
5398000 mark roberts why dont you debunk all the satanic symbols in the dollar bill or in the street design of washington you fucking snake oil piece of shit
5398001 maybe we can set up a pudding wresting match between you and roberts naaa on second hand it would be a lot funnier just to toss him in a giant bowl of chocolate pudding and watch him try and eat himself out of the giant morrass of pudding
5398002 roberts predictably appears to be very well rehearsed and highly informed on every detail of every red herring the government has spewed since 9 12
5398003 mark roberts is insane he has been sent insane by unscrupulous psychiatrists who have got to work on him and exploiting him these psychiatrists more than likely work very closely with jref i urge people on this board to ask mark roberts about his background and whether he has had a history or is currently seeing such practitioners maybe if he is forced to consider his situation he may break out from the wicked spell he is under a spell that has done untold damage to this movement
5398004 the guy is just a purchased flake with zero integrity there are plenty of disreputable characters pushing the official conspiracy theory for a buck lets go with occams razor on this one the guy is not sick the guy is a simple slug
5398005 i dont know if hes an mkultra victim but he is a piece of shit one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet imo i cant wait until 9 11 inside job is proven in everyones eyes gravy will go down in history as the guy who defending the corrupt regime who murdered 3 000 of its own people to then go on to murder hundreds of thousands possibly millions abroad the blood of all those innocent people will be on gravys hands too
5398006 oh stop asking such questions us lot only get together on here to pull each others legs
5398007 you made me spend 5 minutes of my time on this ridiculously stupid disinformation document which is clearly
5398008 how does a tour guide know so much 9 11
5398009 mark roberts is a cia cointelpro agent and a paid liar a good one at that
5398010 you cant debunk the people in the basement who were blown up
5398011 the idiot host and his grotesque sidekick are beneath contempt
5398012 he looks very hard though im guessing ex military maybe ex special forces
5398013 well theres the fact that i think arrowhead pointed out in another thread that the name
5398014 mark roberts was the name of the black villain hero and special ops agent in the movie us marshalls
5398015 im undecided as to whether gravy is just another asinine fool with emotional problems or if he is a self centered simpleton who cannot accept an explanation that violates the emotional blanket afforded to him by the government propaganda
5398016 special forces do you mean special like retarded or do you really mean the military sf btw that guy doesnt look very stable to me id hate to be alone in a room with him after bush declares martial law and makes him a camp commander ph43r
5398017 i can virtually guarentee that gravy is some type of cointelpro operative
5398018 suppossedly roberts is also a freemason i know of a few oithem and they do indeed seem to suffer from mental problems
5398019 hey mark i was just wondering are you a mason someone here said you were after you shilled here the other day

5398028 for one thing my personality and temperament make me quite unfit for the demands of political life being overly individualistic and solitary not to mention opinionated and stubborn i would find it very hard to submit to party discipline and consensus
5398029 im sure if i joined any party i would be booted out within a month i can claim only two abilities being able to speak and write but thats okay as i can make reasonable use of them in my role as political commentator
5398030 i believe that much of the fear we singaporeans experience is unnecessary and self inflicted which of course suits the pap fine since it makes its work of control that much easier
5398031 there is one special group im interested in those who follow political developments keenly and are now wondering whether they should move from being passive observers to active participants in public discussion and debate for them i have an urgent message if you have the following reservations you can overcome them as i have
5398032 see i can just as well come up with reasons not to do something
5398033 there is one special group im interested in those who follow political developments keenly and are now wondering whether they should move from being passive observers to active participants in public discussion and debate
5398034 i have been challenged as well as invited many times to get into the political arena but my answer has always been no for i am aware of my limitations pretty serious ones at that for one thing my personality and temperament make me quite unfit for the demands of political life being overly individualistic and solitary not to mention opinionated and stubborn i would find it very hard to submit to party discipline and consensus
5398035 for them i have an urgent message if you have the following reservations you can overcome them as i have
5398036 my reason for not wanting to join a political party
5398037 so my rallying cry to singaporeans is this think through speak out stand up and try not to be too afraid
5398038 you will notice that my operative words are honesty sincerity conviction and good intentions ultimately these are the most important qualities to bring to any relationship in any sphere political business or professional in the public or private domain
5398039 the fact that legal threats exist is a reality to remove the legal threat you either have to overthrow the pap and change the law or expect a miracle
5398040 let me ask you this consider if i am a non swimmer i decided to overcome my unnecessary and self inflicted fear of the water by learning how to swim in the pool i finally can do 20 laps in the pool however i am still unable to overcome my unnecessary and self inflicted fear of the sea
5398041 oh i have asked several political partiess chief but they turned me down
5398042 however i am still unable to overcome my unnecessary and self inflicted fear of the sea if i am to ask people to take up swimming in the pool because i overcame that fear but unable to overcome the fear of swimming in the sea should i be considered to be inconsistent do i need to overcome the sea first before i can encourage people to swim in the pool to be seen to be consistent
5398043 this is my experience as you can see it is not a easy one i cant say you will or will not have an easy ride if you chose to do what i do i have been lucky i have not been dealt robustly by the government
5398044 i believe that much of the fear we singaporeans experience is unnecessary and self inflicted which of course suits the pap fine since it makes its work of control that much easier
5398045 she ends with the guideline on what should be observed when speaking up which is honesty sincerity conviction and good intentions
5398046 the point i am trying to point out is that her excuse not joining could just as well equally apply to people who chose not to speak up
5398047 freedom of speech does not mean 100 freedom in uttering rubbish the way csj is doing now freedom of speech does not mean making poking fun at politicans including president or pm the way the taiwanese have been displaying a circus of sorts for many the world over to watch
5398048 i am for freedom of speech for a good cause but not for freedom of speech the way csj is advocating
5398049 the difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug
5398050 the st has not much of a choice but to publish the said article the st has to pre empt the back lash of lack of freedom of speech f it were not to do so also the st does not want the toc to scoop it
5398051 if ure not happy dnt complain join a political party and den complain
5398052 find it very hard to submit to party discipline and consensus
5398053 rallying cry to singaporeans to think through speak out stand up and try not to be too afraid
5398054 t hink through speak out stand up and try not to be too afraid
5398055 what catherine is suggesting is that you can somehow be a complainer and not expecting people to challenge you to cook a better mee goreng
5398056 remember it was she who set herself up as an example for people to follow its a bit like in the army if the pti is only as good as the men he she is training than what good is a pti after all isnt a pti supposed to be one step better than the men he she is training
5398057 catherines article is all about speaking out in a pap controlled singapore politics
5398058 if no opposition stand in your constituency can you vote no mee goreng store can you buy mee goreng
5398059 if an opposition party member commenting on a policy and you not an opposition party member commenting on a policy are both of you not involved in politics if you want to comment on something do you not hope to bring about change when a politician comment on a policy is he she not hoping to influence change so what is the difference between the two both cases
5398060 thirdly you fear that as a political critic you will bring upon yourself the wrath of a powerful and implacable government perhaps even strong punitive action wrong again

5398073 these industries also rely strongly on word of mouth good contractors do really well and get lots of work

5398075 the lack of competitive options for the big railroads translates into higher volumes and higher prices
5398076 exposure to tributyltin is increasing the number of fat cells so the individual will get fatter faster as these cells produce more of the hormones that say feed me
5398077 once these genetic changes happen in utero they are irreversible and with the individual for life
5398078 these in utero effects are lifetime effects and they occur at phenomenally small levels
5398079 our conclusion is that there is no risk to human health
5398080 they work virtually the same way in fish as they do in rodents and humans
5398081 tributyltin is the only endocrine disrupting chemical that has been shown without substantial argument to have an effect at levels at which its found in the environment
5398082 our job is to follow the science and based on these animal studies this is worth taking a look at
5398083 theres too much confusion i cant get no relief businessmen they drink my wine plowmen dig my earth none of them along the line know what any of it is worth
5398084 there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke but you and i weve been through that and this is not our fate so let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late

5398087 our study will investigate a key issue behind cerebral palsy whether genetic factors make women more vulnerable to environmental risks that affect the brain of their unborn child these risks such as prematurity and infections combined with genetic susceptibility mean that babies could be at double jeopardy of cerebral palsy
5398088 recent studies by our group suggest that cerebral palsy may be associated with genetic and other mutations that may increase blood clotting within the brain
5398089 an association between cerebral palsy and different types of herpes virus infection such as cold sores and chicken pox has also been discovered in south australian studies the next step is to see if this is true in a much large population comparing the genetics of both mother and child
5398090 obstetric care and caesarean deliveries have increased sixfold over the last 50 years but the incidence of cerebral palsy cases has remained the same most of the cases are associated with problems during pregnancy and possible genetic susceptibility currently there is no cure or way to prevent cerebral palsy

5398093 we got the call about 9 58 this morning from a male passenger stating that he was locked in the bathroom of united flight 93 traveling from newark to san francisco and they were being hijacked
5398094 we confirmed that with him several times and we asked him to repeat what he said he was very distraught he said he believed the plane was going down he did hear some sort of an explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane but he didnt know where and then we lost contact with him
5398095 for example in the days following the crash the associated press interviewed glen cramer a westmoreland county emergency services supervisor who told ap and other news agencies that he had read
5398096 there was no mention of white smoke or an explosion
5398097 i saw the plane flying upside down overhead and crash into the nearby trees my buddy doug and i grabbed our fire extinguishers and ran to the scene
5398098 it was low enough i thought you could probably count the rivets you could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly it was on its side there was a great explosion and you could see the flames it was a massive massive explosion flames and then smoke and then a massive massive mushroom cloud
5398099 there was a crater in the ground that was really burning
5398100 i just watched with my mouth open as this yellow mushroom cloud rose up just like an atomic bomb over the hill where i like to go hunting
5398101 when the plane hit it sounded like something just fell on the roof everybody sort of panicked
5398102 i went to the window and saw all this smoke coming up and i just pointed and screamed
5398103 i heard it for 10 or 15 seconds and it sounded like it was going full bore
5398104 i saw the top of the plane not the bottom
5398105 so fast that you couldnt even make out what color it was
5398106 it just went flip to the right and then straight down
5398107 it was moving like you wouldnt believe next thing i knew it makes a heck of a sharp right hand turn
5398108 there was an incredibly loud rumbling sound and there it was right there right above my head maybe 50 feet up i saw it rock from side to side then suddenly it dipped and dived nose first with a huge explosion into the ground i knew immediately that no one could possibly have survived
5398109 there was no smoke it just went straight down i saw the belly of the plane
5398110 it came in low over the trees and started wobbling then it just rolled over and was flying upside down for a few seconds and then it kind of stalled and did a nose dive over the trees
5398111 i looked out the window and saw the plane nose dive right into the ground
5398112 it was just a streak of silver then a fireball shot up as high as the clouds there was no way anybody could have survived i called 911 right away
5398113 shanksville volunteer fire company assistant fire chief rick king and three firefighters were the first responders on the scene with an engine and a tanker shanksville fire chief terry shaffer also responded from 10 minutes away

5398115 he saw a wiring harness and a piston none of the other pieces was bigger than a tv remote he saw three chunks of torn human tissue he swallowed hard you knew there were people there but you couldnt see them he says
5398116 we arrived in the immediate area and walked up to the crater and the burning woods my first thought was where is the plane because most of what i saw was this honeycomb looking stuff which i believe is insulation or something like that i was not seeing anything that was distinguishable either as human remains or aircraft debris
5398117 we were so early that they hadnt had a chance to set up a barrier for the press i was able to get right up to the edge of the crater all i saw was a crater filled with small charred plane parts there were no suitcases no recognizable plane parts no body parts
5398118 several trees were burned badly and there were papers everywhere we searched i was told that there were 224 passengers but later found out that there were actually forty i was stunned there was nothing there
5398119 those who were there moments later say the smoking wreckage looked like a pile of scrap metal in a pit until you focused more closely and saw the other kinds of fragments among the debris
5398120 king said the red cross has been on the scene from the beginning providing food and water to more than 600 exhausted workers from local fire departments fbi atf ntsb fema state police and coroners offices from around pennsylvania

5398127 we havent wanted to bother the families with the return of property without the return of remains

5398133 comodo firewall pro represents a paradigm shift in the way we protect our pcs from security threats such as viruses trojans and malware of all sorts
5398134 today most security solutions are detection based and detection can no longer be the first line of defense rather prevention must become the first line of defense in computer security and comodo firewall pro was engineered with that capability we need to start denying malware access to the cpu and proceed from the position of allowing only trusted applications cpu access the comodo companies are able to deliver this breakthrough approach because we leverage our certification authority heritage to authenticate trusted applications and executables

5398137 an unusual use of the funds and an important precedent for future projects was the construction of a velodrome bicycle racing track in the atlanta suburb of east point the velodrome was completed in 1975 at a cost of 200 000 shared with the state staff of hcrs heritage conservation and recreation service were instrumental in arranging the funding to complete the velodrome which had been planned in that area for some time initial concern that the facility would lie unused proved unfounded the complex which includes a 330 meter bicycle track jogging track concession building with lockers and bleacher seating for 1500 is heavily used by sports enthusiasts of all ages
5398138 we want people to participate in outdoor recreational activities but we want people to recognize that theres cause for concern and people can and do get injured
5398139 it could be that males are more risky or it could be that males just participate more than females or a combination of both
5398140 it makes perfect sense to me that snowboard injuries rank high
5398141 some activities have risks and you cant take all the risks out of the wilderness
5398142 but what youd like to do is take the unnecessary risk out

5398149 apis change when major versions of the software are released
5398150 luckily asterisk is an open source project which means that when asterisk does evolve that the changes arent made in secret any third party developer who wants to make sure his code remains compatible with the latest version of asterisk can do so at any time he doesnt have to wait until 1 6 0 is released to find out that his code will have to be changed to fit the new apis the asterisk code is always available to test play with qualify against etc so that the developer can update their code to be compatible so that when the time comes that real users want to use it their applications will be ready
5398151 you break it you fix it i break it i fix it
5398152 the next point id like to address is that of responsibility
5398153 last but not least lets talk directly about your bug report in it you claim that lack of native support for either flite or cepstral tts breaks thousands of existing text to speech asterisk applications asterisk has never had native support for either cepstral or flite for text to speech so im not sure how not having it in asterisk 1 6 breaks anything im afraid that if i were to follow your logic to its logical conclusion it would be better to write that as since the developer that wrote app swift wont update the code for asterisk 1 6 its digiums responsibility to do so again ive got to point out that flite and app swift are totally outside the control of the asterisk development team
5398154 i have stopped updating because i am concerned that updates may cause downtime to insulate myself from this problem i am building a second machine to run the upgrade on before attacking my production machine
5398155 it wasnt implemented well so were just going to remove it rather than fix it besides you can probably cobble up something similar with a bunch of dialplan stuff anyway
5398156 name an open source project that maintains source level api compatibility as a guarantee between major releases
5398157 each module to be removed needs to have a justification as to why it should no longer be distributed with python
5398158 we know the atms are better but we still want tellers because its what were used to
5398159 these companies are still going strong and fortune 500 medical and government sectors still use them i think it s a bit premature to think that asterisk will fall flat on it s face for making some radical changes that might result in incompatibilities

5398189 i mean i guess when he had it on he was okay
5398190 well apparently if i ever met batman in real life id be smitten
5398191 who is so secure in his heterosexuality that i can work a bathroom full of strangers with ease establishing eye contact and chit chatting shaking hands and slapping backs grabbing biscuits and poking at biceps and abs all in a totally non gay way

5398202 oh it sold because it was too difficult well just make it easier
5398203 were still not entirely sure why it didnt sell could be marketing the strange characters the cartoony style yeah right the non genre specific nature of it or any combination of all of those but were sure people will like it this time

5398224 this study informs us about the pathway to becoming sexually deviant for females
5398225 with that knowledge we can improve treatment and reduce the likelihood of future sexual assaults on children
5398226 weve pretty much known that the majority of women in prison have had bad childhoods and that many suffered childhood sexual abuse
5398227 but the subgroup of female sex offenders has suffered significantly more abuse particularly sexual abuse

5398231 but among the smallest cars the engineers of the smart did their homework and designed a high level of safety into a very small package
5398232 the big question from consumers is how safe is it
5398233 all things being equal in safety bigger and heavier is always better but among the smallest cars the engineers of the smart did their homework and designed a high level of safety into a very small package
5398234 people base their buying decisions on a lot of factors
5398235 if you drive only in congested urban areas where speeds are low a small car may be more practical than a big one we conduct crash tests so people who want small cars can choose the ones that afford the best protection
5398236 we recorded a high head acceleration when the driver dummys head hit the steering wheel through the frontal airbag
5398237 you dont have to buy the smallest lightest car to get one thats easy on fuel consumption
5398238 the toyota prius for example earns good front and side crash test ratings it gets better fuel economy than a microcar but its bigger and weighs more so we would expect it would be more protective in serious crashes
5398239 all things being equal in safety bigger and heavier is always better

5398256 think about what it would say if you had a group of cardinals patriarchs the head of the methodist church the evangelicals coming together and themselves issuing a statement with regard to islam think about the way in which people in the muslim world would look at that statement and the impact it would have

5398347 were in a period of extraordinary change to the built environment massive amounts of capital is going into new housing just as in the 21st century you need to be ultra aware of carbon its vital to be aware of how people use spaces especially as life expectancy surges to the 90s and 100s
5398348 the housing industry has been extraordinarily slow to grasp how fundamental these changes are
5398349 im not that keen on more bureaucracy id rather the industry took the lead itself one of the reasons the industry is so vulnerable to cyclical swings is it is so bad at planning ahead you dont need everything spelled out in regulation
5398350 in china there is rapid growth of cities based on tower blocks based on cars and theyre finding all sorts of social problems and the environmental cost

5398355 youve been conned youve been scammed by the system by a bunch of manufacturers a whole lot of big business and a good dose of government corruption thrown in to protect the system and make sure you never find out what is going on youve been scammed
5398356 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand we should take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
5398357 this woman is tremendous she is a great woman but obama how many mentors did he need before he became a man i dont think he has reached that point yet
5398358 in mccains past record he has been rather liberal he has liberal qualities
5398359 do i think hed be another george bush absolutely not
5398360 well this isnt exactly the party i planned but i sure like the company
5398361 my commitment to you and the progress we seek is unyielding
5398362 i ask all of you to join me in working as hard for barack obama as you have for me
5398363 just think how much more progress we could have made over the past 40 years if we had a democratic president
5398364 think about the lost opportunities of these past seven years on the environment and the economy on health care and civil rights on education foreign policy and the supreme court
5398365 there was no hesitation there was no bitterness there was no anger
5398366 there was sadness but then there was just lets move forward for the good of the country so i felt very good about it
5398367 well you know look hillary is telling her supporters gather behind the obama banner ninety nine percent will
5398368 there may be a few that are bitter but what i have found in most of these campaigns one good thing is democrats do come together because the difference between hillary clinton and barack obama is not close to as great as the difference between either of them and john mccain and we cannot afford another four years of bush like policies
5398369 if we can blast 50 women into space we will some day launch a woman into the white house
5398370 were very fortunate weve had people come to conshohocken to invest and develop
5398371 because of the success of conshohocken our change from a blue collar to a white collar community weve lost some things towns can be a victim of their own success its time we add something for the residents
5398372 and we may still move the borough offices in there theres been no decision
5398373 they showed me their badges and said they were from the illinois department of revenue
5398374 i came out of the bathroom i thought good god we paid our taxes the check didnt bounce
5398375 they told me i am required to have a license and am obligated to pay a motor fuel tax
5398376 mr may also told me the tax would be retroactive
5398377 i would agree that the bond is not acceptable 2 500 bond
5398378 his car gets 46 miles per gallon running on vegetable oil we all should be thinking about doing without gasoline if were trying to end foreign dependency
5398379 i think its inappropriate of state dollars to send two people to mr wetzels home to do this they could have done with a more friendly approach it could have been done on the phone to use an intimidation factor on this who is he harming two revenue agents youd think theres a better use of their time

5398382 we are in the process of creating a way to simplify the registration process and self assess the tax
5398383 you hear the president saying we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
5398384 im disappointed that the illinois department of revenue would go after mr wetzel
5398385 i dont think it is a situation that merits him being licensed and paying fees
5398386 the people at the department of revenue apparently feel they need to regulate him in some way we want to make sure that he is as free as he can be to use vegetable oil hes an example of ingenuity instead of being whacked on the head he should be encouraged
5398387 the gall peters achieved considerable notoriety in the late 20th century as the centerpiece of a controversy surrounding the political implications of map design
5398388 its possible however and sometimes very useful to redraw the map with the sizes of countries made bigger or smaller in order to represent something of interest such maps are called cartograms and can be an effective and natural way of portraying geographic or social data
5398389 worldmapper is a collection of world maps where territories are re sized on each map according to the subject of interest there are now nearly 600 maps

5398392 those who tried to get out somewhere safe were being bombed they didnt care if it was women children or old men
5398393 they just came into to the womens part of the house so we women went to the elders and we told them if you dont stop this we women will stand against them
5398394 when the americans came the people started fighting them back and then the planes came and started bombing us
5398395 even under the russians we havent witnessed bombardments like it before
5398396 we have no reports that confirm to us that non combatants were injured or killed out in shindand
5398397 if there are insurgents that are effectively engaging our forces and they happen to be coming from a building we would make every use we can of technology we have and precision weapons to eliminate the threat and minimise the effects of collateral damage
5398398 in all of these incidents it was the coalition forces or their special forces that were involved rather than nato
5398399 if something like that happens then the honour of the family and of that man would be under question
5398400 it makes those men who are very very conservative very upset and very angry and they would be ready to do whatever they can do to stop it or to prevent it or to regain their honour that was lost
5398401 we know that the presence of foreign troops some times makes problems but imagine if these troops were not in afghanistan
5398402 dont you think there will be a government in every street wont we go back to years of hunger devastation and miseries foreign troops are like powerful drugs that cure a disease but have side effects as well

5398407 mechanism that allows your body to manufacture sugars all by itself
5398408 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5398409 mindless eating author appointed usdas new director of nutrition policy and promotion
5398410 christines triglycerides plummet 55 in just six weeks on a truly low carb diet
5398411 when we eat protein we will use it to repair tissue damage or poop it out there is no storage shelf for protein so the protein part of the burger most of it would be eliminated in the stool
5398412 its interesting because while the glycemic index sounds good in theory it does not work clinically any diabetic who attempts to use the glycemic index as a guide will have elevated blood sugars as a result i read one book about the glycemic index written by a group of australian researchers after getting about a third of the way through the book i threw it out the book stated that eating things like potatotes and whole wheat pasta would not raise the blood sugar much as the sugar is released more slowly through digestive processes what happens in reality is that one may not see an immediate rise but the sugar does rise a few hours after eating the low glycemic index foods and can stay elevated for many hours thereafter can i hear a great big oops
5398413 why is the fats so low on the lowcarb pyramid
5398414 blood glucose remained unchanged in the controls but rose on an average 13 mg 100 ml in insulin requiring diabetics
5398415 why is the amount they prescribe in the food ladder so low little
5398416 if a type 2 diabetic has higher insulin levels wouldnt this prevent the body from utilizing fat for fuel
5398417 fatty acids can still be used to create atp as fatty acids use a different transport mechanism to get into the cell
5398418 if youre going to follow me you gotta take up your cross deny yourself and follow me
5398419 well if you just pray and love people and preach the word your church will grow
5398420 prayer alone isnt going to grow any churches you have to actually get out there and work at it and that takes skill we cant be a bunch of unskilled people who merely claim that if we pray and preach that our churches will grow or flourish
5398421 john piper preaches and prays but he is also very good at what he does we could say that he has skill yeah
5398422 they forget 95 of what they hear within 72 hours well if youre forgetting 95 of everything youve heard in your lifetime that is not going to produce spiritual maturity
5398423 the heart of what warren seems to be getting at is that preaching and praying dont grow churches relationships do
5398424 i seriously doubt warren would say that warm and inviting relationships is the power of salvation
5398425 the gospel is a message and a message is given through preaching
5398426 how then can they call on the one they have not believed in and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them
5398427 the fact is that god doesnt call the qualified he qualifies the called
5398428 a lot of people simply cant think well about theology so they need someone else to think for them who should it be
5398429 i have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
5398430 the majority of what the fathers did was to present the best possible case from scripture to defend their beliefs
5398431 i would not believe in the gospels were it not for the authority of the catholic church
5398432 isnt it ironic that the doctrine of sola scriptura isnt actually found in scripture
5398433 so my questions would be how do we know which books are to be included in scripture
5398434 as far as i know ss means only that the bible is the final not only authority for christian doctrine and practice
5398435 it doesnt seem as though the church simply divined the answer to this question but rather the issue was debated
5398436 but i also realize that we are finite and fallen human beings and any kind of infallibility should not reasonably be expected in this life
5398437 why cant the holy spirit protect the church that christ founded from error
5398438 rc sproul as great a teacher as he may be doesnt have that kind of authority
5398439 there were multiple councils multiple debates the best arguments won out
5398440 and interestingly i think that rationale was deviated from when the catholic church officially declared the apocryphal books to be inspired scripture
5398441 first of course its possible that the holy spirit do this but as a protestant looking at catholic doctrine through what i believe to be the eyes of scripture i think i see pretty clear errors
5398442 well for one thing i look at that process and i cant detect any errors
5398443 second im not sure how the holy spirit could guard the church completely from error given free will
5398444 im not sure i understand your comment about authority though
5398445 i hope that you arent hearing me say that there was some divine table of contents that fell from the sky or god spoke from heaven
5398446 what is it about philemon or 3john or ruth that make them obviously scripture while the letters of clement or the didache or letter of barnabas among others are not scripture
5398447 if we dont have an infallible church then we cant know with absolute certainty that the bible is infallible
5398448 if this is correct then i simply havent heard any good arguments for why the church cannot fall into error as i said from a protestant perspective it appears that the church has indeed fallen into error from time to time citing passages where jesus appears to give authority to the apostles doesnt show that the same authority was meant for future generations of the church
5398449 but that isnt really an argument for thinking that the church actually is infallible it would simply make things more convenient if it was in other words it sounds a bit like adding a safety net but if i think that all the evidence leads persuasively to the conclusion that the bible we have today is the inspired word of god then there isnt really an urgent need for this safety net
5398450 as i said he doesnt seem to have done so with the jews and yet we have no problem accepting the old testament as inspired
5398451 1 one must be able to deduce the doctrine of ss by exegesis alone
5398452 2 the general public must be able to access scripture
5398453 if the oral teaching were not infallible then there would be nothing to record in scripture
5398454 the best argument didnt necessarily win out jerome was pretty smart and he ultimately submitted to the pope
5398455 looking at israel actually works in favor of accepting the authority of the church much of what israel did was handed down by oral tradition
5398456 this isnt unrealistic as that is how the church functioned from the beginning history is on our side
5398457 as for you stating that there are clear errors in catholic doctrine i would ask you to provide an example of these errors
5398458 you have said many times that the best arguments won out lets suppose that is true then what keeps us from allowing those arguments to resurface and make changes to the cannnon
5398459 quite right that we all must accept the word of some authority for most of what we believe
5398460 you and i have had this discussion for a while and we could go point counterpoint forever which of us is correct
5398461 the final authority scripture isnt even consulted when one decides that he is going to follow this doctrine this argument may not be circular but it makes no sense
5398462 the roman pontiff by reason of his office as vicar of christ and as pastor of the entire church has full supreme and universal power over the whole church a power which he can always exercise unhindered
5398463 the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god whether in its written form or in the form of tradition has been entrusted to the living teaching office of the church alone its authority in this matter is exercised in the name of jesus christ
5398464 tradition x is likely the one that paul was referring to in 2 thess
5398465 the church is infallible because the tradition of the church which was later recorded as scripture says so
5398466 the church is chronologically prior to any scripture the oral teaching preceded the written therefore the church was already established by christ and scripture was intended to be used within its context
5398467 the magisterium bishops is the office handed down directly from the apostles every bishop in the catholic as well as orthodox church can trace their succession all the way back to one of the apostles this office was handed down literally by the laying on of hands
5398468 has it ever occurred to you how few are the alleged failures of infallibility i mean if somebody propounded in your presence the thesis that all the kings of england have been impeccable you would not find yourself murmuring oh well people said rather unpleasant things about jane shore and the best historians seem to think that charles ii spent too much of his time with nell gwynn here have these popes been fulminating anathema after anathema for centuries certain in all human probability to contradict themselves or one another over again instead of which you get this measly crop of two or three alleged failures
5398469 wherever the bishop appears let the people be there just as wherever jesus christ is there is the catholic church
5398470 he who hears you hears me and he who rejects you rejects me and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me
5398471 we commit ourselves to any wrong or degradation or injury when we do not protest against it
5398472 it has a flat floor to allow exit from either side of the vehicle
5398473 one of the greatest advantages of the web is something that your average dedicated print designer or software developer cant get their arms around the idea that its a fluid medium that information can be experienced in as many ways as there are users
5398474 on the web all that goes out the window users could be running anything from a text to speech browser to the latest version of internet explorer with javascript disabled their systems can be anything from the newest version of beos to an old amiga and monitors can range from old 14 inch bricks running 16 colors at 640x480 to the latest flat panel running at 32 bit and 1 600x2 000 pixels ultimately the user has control and no matter how much the designer or developer wants to wrest that control it just cant be done
5398475 the web is a flexible medium designed to accommodate different types of users and a variety of display devices
5398476 it is possible to create flexible layout tables that resize gracefully without sacrificing the integrity of your design but if you are turning to layout tables for precision you will need to use fixed width layout tables
5398477 for web designers the monitor screen does not have fixed width or height because these variables change at times in unpredictable ways
5398478 create documents that do not rely on one type of hardware pages should be usable by people without mice with small screens low resolution screens black and white screens no screens with only voice or text output etc

5398482 weve identified a general corridor where the rail spur could be located but the exact route is still undefined
5398483 when it comes to mapping the route were somewhat limited by the location of the former railroad and other engineering constraints but we would like to get input to reduce any farming environmental and community impacts wherever practical
5398484 in addition to using the rail spur to move equipment during construction we may also use it to transport fuel or other plant byproducts if we build the plant weve not made a decision yet however on whether to transport coal by train or truck to the plant it will mostly depend on the economics of train and truck transportation at the time

5398487 the levees are not going to hold that much water
5398488 its so much easier for them to go now instead of us having to pull them out later
5398489 we believe that those levees will be breached if it continues on the same track so please stay away from those levees
5398490 if my house floods well just run to the roof

5398493 i would love you a lot more if you brought in more money
5398494 i was praying for a situation to happen so that id be able to go home
5398495 in the course of our search we found that there was trafficking going on in the united states that nobody was talking about
5398496 told me the next time i leave hes going to put me in a suitcase
5398497 i am his investment i am his way of getting money at the end of the day if you think about it a pimp does nothing more but collect the money
5398498 our primary competition is pimps theyre spending 110 percent of their time and energy on recruiting on brainwashing on making this girl feel loved and special and pulling her back in every time that she almost leaves this has been four years of her life from 12 to 16 hes 35 he basically raised her
5398499 when its happening two blocks away from this auditorium when its happening in bedford stuyvesant or hunts point or queens plaza we look the other way

5398501 there really isnt anything there that the federal reserve can do
5398502 sometimes the federal reserve chairman is there not because he can do something but to serve a foil in this particular case to frame the issue on mortgage relief in a more favorable light
5398503 the federal reserve has perhaps legitimized such aid because of its move with bear stearns

5398590 this generation of albertans has a unique opportunity to build for tomorrow and an important part of that must be ensuring that ideas and innovations developed in our province are commercialized in our province
5398591 for the next generation economy were tapping into the resource that never depletes knowledge our broad range of actions will ensure alberta is well situated in the global knowledge based economy and will create opportunities for generations to come
5398592 were building on our success to create an environment where technopreneurs thrive and new companies grow quickly producing technologies and products that are successful in global markets this plan focuses on the right mix of environment support mechanisms and incentives for our high tech entrepreneurs to break through in global markets with the next big idea
5398593 getting a return on innovation in global markets is all about commercialization the transformation of research discoveries into valuable market driving products and services
5398594 this plan is a positive stimulus to albertas innovation ecosystem at all levels once up and running it basically means early stage technology based companies will have little reason to leave the province to succeed they can reach out globally from a solid alberta base that has a mandate to establish financial and technology linkages worldwide

5398615 the trace metal compositions of the dust and girder coatings likely reflect contributions of material from a wide variety of sources possibilities include metals that might be found as pigments in paints such as titanium molybdenum lead and iron or metals that occur as traces in or as major components of wallboard concrete aggregate copper piping electrical wiring and computer equipment further detailed sem studies of dust and beam coating samples are needed to develop a better understanding of the residences of metals in the samples a detailed review of the materials used in construction and the elemental composition of materials commonly found in office buildings would also be useful to understand more completely the potential sources and compositions of the materials in the dusts
5398616 the levels of many of the elements are consistent with their presence in building materials including chromium magnesium source p 709
5398617 separate from the wtc towers investigation nist researchers estimated that at least 0 13 pounds of thermite would be required to heat each pound of a steel section to approximately 700 degrees celsius the temperature at which steel weakens substantially therefore while a thermite reaction can cut through large steel columns many thousands of pounds of thermite would need to have been placed inconspicuously ahead of time remotely ignited and somehow held in direct contact with the surface of hundreds of massive structural components to weaken the building this makes it an unlikely substance for achieving a controlled demolition analysis of the wtc steel for the elements in thermite thermate would not necessarily have been conclusive the metal compounds also would have been present in the construction materials making up the wtc towers and sulfur is present approx 19 by weight in the gypsum wallboard that was prevalent in the interior partitions

5398634 is there anything you wish you had done differently in the design of the building
5398635 the world trade center was a team effort but the collapse of the world trade center is my responsibility and thats the way i feel about it
5398636 i was the designer of the world trade center although that was wrong actually i only assisted on the team that designed it but thats who i was
5398637 a womans cell phone rang and she said an airplane had hit the world trade towers i thought it was an accident one of the helicopters that were always flying overhead a short time later my wife called me and said the second plane had hit and i went upstairs and turned on the television i knew both buildings were hit by planes both on fire i had no idea whether there were a thousand people or fifty thousand people at risk i knew the fire was burning out of control i knew people were jumping to get away from the heat
5398638 did any part of your brain calculating say theres probably this amount of jet fuel this amount of fire protection the building has this long to last
5398639 i cant i think there are times when logic just isnt the right way to think
5398640 this all took place in an hour and a half the tv was on i dont know if what i saw was the buildings falling down on rerun or whether it was live i was just focussed on getting back to new york city i remember packing my bags and when the building collapsed it was totally devastating
5398641 a building like the empire state building is way overdesigned and overbuilt the building didnt need all that support those engineers didnt understand loads the way we understand them they used slide rules to work them out whereas we have computers and so they erred on the side of caution
5398642 i learned that i actually knew how to do things and if i wanted to i could get them done
5398643 these are guys with big egos and things got a little testy between them regarding who was ultimately responsible for the design
5398644 skilling said it was me robertson said it was me but i think the truth is that both of them made a significant contribution
5398645 im sort of a methodical person so i listed all the bad things that could happen to a building and tried to design for them i thought of the b 25 bomber lost in the fog that hit the empire state building in 1945 the 707 was the state of the art airplane then and the port authority was quite amenable to considering the effect of an airplane as a design criterion we studied it and designed for the impact of such an aircraft the next step would have been to think about the fuel load and ive been searching my brain but i dont know what happened there whether in all our testing we thought about it now we know what happens it explodes i dont know if we considered the fire damage that would cause anyway the architect not the engineer is the one who specifies the fire system
5398646 ninety nine per cent of all buildings would collapse immediately when hit by a 767
5398647 floor beams or trusses will heat up faster than columns because theyre thinner pieces of steel
5398648 the weakest link was definitely the connections of the floor trusses to the vertical members
5398649 if you knock it that spray on protection will come off when i visited the site i went through the american express and the bankers trust buildings and i saw large chunks of the fireproofing in those buildings knocked off and that was only by falling debris not by an airplane hit i think we can assume there was a lot of unprotected steel in the towers after the planes hit
5398650 once the collapse started it was essentially a free fall
5398651 youd need a graduate degree in engineering to know exactly where to hit those buildings to make them fall hit them higher and the weight above the crash sites might not be enough to bring the whole thing down hit them lower and the core columns might have been strong enough to stand up
5398652 of all the buildings in the world the closest to being pure tube buildings
5398653 on the other hand there were other fires in the buildings over the years and one quite serious one and the fireproofing on those rods did o k
5398654 we had no idea of the extent of the damage and certainly none of us had the information to make a decision to keep the rescue workers who entered the buildings out of them
5398655 i do think it may be a good idea in the event of something like this happening in the future to have a structural engineer on the scene who arrives with the firemen and makes that cold objective decision to send people in or not send them but first of all that person would have to have no emotional relationship to the people inside or to the building i mean for us this was our second home and secondly that person would have to be absolutely liability free because thats one hell of a decision to make
5398656 i thought somebodys got to tell the fire department to get out of there
5398657 i picked up the phone dialled 411 got the number and tried it busy
5398658 first of all youve got the obvious damage to the exterior frame from the airplane if you count the number of external columns missing from the sides the planes hit there are about two thirds of the total and the buildings are still standing which is amazing even with all those columns missing the gravity loads have found alternate pathways o k but youve got fires jet fuel fires which the building is not designed for and youve also got lots of paper in there now paper cooks a paper fire is like a coal mine fire it keeps burning as long as oxygen gets to it and youre high in the building up in the wind plenty of oxygen so youve got a hot fire and youve got these floor trusses made of fairly thin metal and fire protection has been knocked off most of them by the impact and you have all this open space clear span from perimeter to core with no columns or partition walls so the airplane is going to skid right through that space to the core which doesnt have any reinforced concrete in it just sheetrock covering steel and the fire is going to spread everywhere immediately and no fire protection systems are working the sprinkler heads shorn off by the airplanes the water pipes in the core are likely cut so whats going to happen floor a is going to fall onto floor b which falls onto floor c the unsupported columns will buckle and the weight of everything above the crash site falls onto what remains below bringing loads of two thousand pounds per square foot plus the force of the impact onto floors designed to bear one hundred pounds per square foot it has to fall
5398659 the top part of the south tower almost did fall off which is what would happen in most buildings did you see how when that top part started to fall it began to rotate if that piece had kept going out it probably would have pushed the rest of the building the other way as it fell but those long trusses saved the day they gave way guided that top downward just like a bullet through the barrel of a gun and mitigated the damage
5398660 let me tell you something far more people would have died if those buildings had been built differently a conventional frame building would have fallen immediately no question only a tube structure could have taken that hit and survived
5398661 the technology of building high rises has got way ahead of the ability to fire protect them adequately
5398662 no one wants to be alarmist but we in the fire service know that in any high rise building built since 1970 the fire safety is questionable
5398663 look from a fire chiefs perspective and im not an engineer but as a fire chief i know buildings the world trade center buildings were not well constructed
5398664 id call them fragile buildings there were no internal columns supporting the floors and those floor trusses were very lightweight essentially it was a pinned construction where the exterior walls are the bearing walls thats the way the old cast iron buildings in soho were built and as every firefighter knows in those buildings the floors collapse in fires in my opinion a skeleton steel building would have stood up better yes you get sections falling off the building maybe even the top part of the building falls off but you dont get pancaking floors that bring the whole structure down
5398665 i can understand where the fire department is coming from they dont build em like they used to
5398666 and thats true but in many ways people are safer in high rise buildings than they are at home
5398667 high rise buildings have performed amazingly well over the years in fires although this event will cause both researchers and public officials to take another look at the performance of these buildings
5398668 i dont care how strong they were if youve got buildings collapsing on firefighters theres something wrong with the way those buildings were built
5398669 if we could learn why the buildings collapsed there would be value in that
5398670 but that other event in oklahoma city that was more quantifiable this is a huge probably an impossible task now to sort out all the proper evidence
5398671 but we figured out that that piece of steel was from the fortieth floor well below either crash site
5398672 i said that it was not necessary to design buildings with the idea of planes running into them its prudent to see what we could do to make things better but you cant design for every eventuality
5398673 i suspect tall buildings will always be with us people need to be close to each other in order to communicate effectively but builders and architects are going to have to make the argument for why tall buildings should be built and why people should move into them
5398674 one of the things youll hear is should we use more concrete
5398675 thorntons firm did the structural engineering for the petronas towers in kuala lumpur currently the tallest buildings in the world those buildings have a concrete core and concrete perimeter columns but that decision was based in part on the fact that malaysia had no steel industry and imposes high tariffs on imported steel
5398676 should we at least require the cores of tall buildings to be reinforced in concrete which would give them more fire protection and give people a better chance of getting out in a fire
5398677 should we have refuge floors spaced every ten floors or so which would allow people some protection from smoke
5398678 thank god we didnt have refuge floors in the world trade towers people might have stopped there to regroup rather than getting out of the buildings as fast as they could
5398679 we have a predicament not only for engineering but for planning and design in general developers and many designers participate in the economy of wealth image and fame and so they press against that minimum
5398680 the building laws will change more redundancy stronger interconnection of parts all attributes of good seismic design by the way as they have after every disaster
5398681 a lot of things worked well people got out i suppose im proud of that
5398682 its a very imperfect process its not so beautiful as science
5398683 i have a lot of tough nights im still not sleeping i go to sleep for a little bit but i wake up thinking i have so many thoughts
5398684 my family thought it was very important for me to do well on this test and i basically obtained nearly every sat study guide out there by the time i was a junior in high school
5398685 for christmas one year i received an electronic device that allowed me to practice the sats on the go
5398686 removes the barrier for those students who had everything else
5398687 not only is the sat a critical tool for success in college but also in the workforce and in life
5398688 the real basis of their concern however is that they have no way of knowing what the sat measures and therefore have no basis for assessing its fairness or helping their children acquire the skills to do better
5398689 it shows whats important to schools if theyre really interested in increasing diversity
5398690 applicants may take too much time on prepping for this test and their time can be better spent dedicating themselves to other activities that could show colleges what the applicants really find meaningful in their lives

5398730 lift the stay in the case and proceed with targeted discovery in order to help protect the integrity of the 2008 election
5398731 we anticipate mr rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in ohio
5398732 be providing copies of document hold notices to the u s chamber institute for legal reform and the u s justice department for karl rove emails from the white house
5398733 a fraud investigation in a bank but it doesnt when it comes to our vote
5398734 this entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody
5398735 w e anticipate mr rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in ohio
5398736 works for credit card companies chasing data thieves identity thieves around the globe and also consults with government agencies including the secret service the pentagon and the federal bureau of investigation in criminal matters hes really one of the top and in fact the top private cop in the world on the subject of data security
5398737 whether the rights privileges and immunities guaranteed to plaintiffs by the civil rights act and the first thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the u s constitution have been violated by the past and ongoing conduct of secretary of state j kenneth blackwell in connection with past elections in ohio
5398738 this was interrupted when the secretary wanted to bring all the ballots that had been ordered preserved by judge marbley bring them in to one location when the ballots came in there was significant omissions and reports of the destruction of some of the ballots
5398739 bobs fitrakis and harvey wassermans book on what happened in ohio documentation of the exit poll discrepancy and john conyers report to the congress which was the factual basis for the challenge to the electoral votes of the ohio vote in january of 2005
5398740 concept of looking at this from a criminal standpoint was not to convene a grand jury and cast the net broadly and use the grand jury process to investigate and narrow the focus into the question of who may have tampered with those votes but rather they wanted us to come to them with a more focused case
5398741 could proceed with the civil case in order to collect discovery to do that
5398742 to go after the issues of election integrity in a very targeted way as opposed to a casting of a fishing net
5398743 we think rove is an individual who has been at the center of both the use of corporate money to attack state attorneys general and their elections and candidates for the supreme court and their elections in the states and also in the manipulation of the election process
5398744 we expressed concern about the reports that mr rove destroyed his emails and suggested that we want the duplicates that should exist be put under the control of the secret service and be sure that those are retained as well as those on the receiving end in the justice department and elsewhere that those documents are retained for purposes of this litigation in which we anticipate mr rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in ohio
5398745 to go after the issues of election integrity in a very targeted way as opposed to a casting of a fishing net
5398746 d esigns websites and he manages the information technology interestingly hes done this for the bush campaign of 2000 and the bush campaign of 2004 simultaneously he was doing it work for the state of florida in 2000 and for the office of the ohio secretary of state in 2004
5398747 and just think of this heres a person who is an instrument of a major presidential campaign simultaneously setting up the hosting of the votes in the ohio election
5398748 were not saying that he connell did anything wrong in the sense of his conduct but were saying that these conflicting roles raise some issues
5398749 mr connell also worked with the various front groups for the us chamber tobacco industry front groups and starting in 2000 after the new hampshire primary there was an unleashing of a variety of these washington based lobbying groups that created these phony grass roots groups that attack candidates supposedly independently we believe there is clear evidence of a coordinated campaign in which mr rove is involved in which mr connell is an instrument and this emphasizes his value of a witness in bringing some of this together
5398750 he by virtue of his involvement in a variety of these roles that were concerned with as a witness he can provide a perspective hes the one person who can bring a great deal of information together to better inform folks of what happened and what some of the vulnerabilities are and where some of the data security breaches may have occurred
5398751 you cannot secure electronic voting you set up a bunch of grandmothers to put together a bunch of computers once every two years basically those machines are architected in such a manner to maximize their capacity for fraud
5398752 in the 2004 election from my perspective on any of the programs we run for any of my credit card clients the results from the 14 counties those are the sort of results that would instantaneously launch a credit card fraud investigation or a banking settlement investigation
5398753 if you adjust for the connelly anomaly or that situation its enough votes to have changed the outcome of the election so the focus of our efforts in cooperation with the secretary of state would be to find out who is responsible for that
5398754 if its the rapp family and the programming of the triad tabulators
5398755 we need to know that so that the rapp family will be closely monitored if not put in jail before the 2008 election
5398756 i am extremely confident in our analysis of the 2004 election anomalies because of the way the tabulators were programmed and all were programmed by the rapp family on triad systems so in my opinion there should be an investigation launched into exactly what happened
5398757 there was an enormous number of strange activities in which triad and the rapp family were running around the state taking hard drives out of computers putting in new hard drives and posting poll results and the reason all this was going on im quite confident was that the hard drives they were pulling out had fraudulent coding simple as that
5398758 certainly if that happened at one of our banks you could be arrested
5398759 when in the green party recount all of the sudden people are driving around the state pulling and swapping hard drives they should have been in handcuffs that day
5398760 has never been interrogated under oath in either a civil or a criminal context to the best of our knowledge there was an fbi investigation launched at the request of john conyers and very shortly a letter coming back from the fbi stating that they had found no problem but it was very minimal and it appears to have been a politicized investigation not a normal serious investigation by the fbi
5398761 quite well and they were certainly never involved in the investigation conyers requested there was no hardware ever involved so whatever investigation was launched it was topical but they never examined the equipment
5398762 focus on corrective actions that are necessary for the protection of the 2008 election
5398763 what happens at the end of the day all those votes are thrown into a magic box with one troll inside the troll jumps out and says here are your results ta da thats it theres no validation of the code theres no authentication
5398764 with the connelly anomaly if that was in a banking environment instantaneously instantaneously the entire system inside that box would be frozen any programmer who reviewed any of that code would be alerted all the executives assisting in that process would be alerted the hard drives would be frozen in place extracted and immediately placed in forensic analysis cause somebody did something major
5398765 none of us the american people really want to confront the fact that there appears to be an extremely coordinated effort by a very small group of people to rig elections and take control of the executive branch
5398766 you can spend all day every day looking at this stuff and saying well that would certainly launch a fraud investigation in a bank but it doesnt when it comes to our vote why
5398767 this entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody in my opinion both sides democrats and republicans have no friggin clue what theyre talking about
5398768 no its not its not a bi partisan system this entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody in my opinion both sides democrats and republicans have no friggin clue what theyre talking about
5398769 the person who programs the code inside the machine will decide the results
5398770 yes ive been a life long member of the republican party sadly
5398771 karl rove was involved in the bush campaign for president in 2000
5398772 at the time the tobacco industry was fighting the clinton administration 260 billion class action rico case
5398773 they turned these groups loose in south carolina they won south carolina with a lot of independent expenditures and dirty tricks
5398774 rove was the architect of a strategy to in effect undo the rule of law turn business loose free of government regulation
5398775 we certainly want to take his roves deposition his deposition has never been taken mr conyers is currently seeking his deposition in regard to what he did in terms of going after governor siegelman in alabama and mr rove is currently evading the congressional subpoena for his testimony

5398797 umpcs ultra mobile pcs have been around for 2 years or so in the relative mainstream long enough that weve seen several very different designs from the tiny oqo to the sleek slider sony vaio ux to those that resemble traditional handhelds sans keyboard like the raon vega but really there have been 3 major design camps the pure slate like the samsung q1 ultra the extremely compact model with a keyboard that slides down from the bottom oqo sony vaio ux and others and more recently the miniature notebook fujitsu u810 and vye htc perhaps the largest manufacturer of windows mobile phones has entered the game late with a design thats truly their own in fact the htc shift looks a lot like a giant htc tilt windows mobile pocket pc phone rather than a notebook or umpc cool the tilt with its slide out and up display is extremely popular and makes even better sense on a vista ultraportable the shift can be used as a slate as a flat slide out keyboard device and in a conventional notebook position with the display upright umpcs attempt to bridge the gap between the mobility of a pda and the power of a notebook and the shift comes closer than most thanks to its relatively large display and borderline touch typable keyboard

5398859 the southern ocean is the largest ocean region where the surface waters directly connect to the oceans interior currents providing a pathway into the deep sea for carbon dioxide released from human activities
5398860 understanding how atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed into these cold surface waters under high winds speeds is important for determining how the ocean uptake of carbon dioxide will respond to future climate change
5398861 our ongoing effort to understand the global carbon cycle will benefit from the data this cruise will produce about the mechanisms that govern gas transfer in this remote part of the worlds ocean
5398862 and nasas global satellite observations of ocean color that reveal so much about the health of our oceans will also be improved in this region as we validate what our space based sensors see with direct measurements taken at sea

5398882 due to the recent controversy and heinous allegations that the o face magazine llc its owners contributors and sponsors
5398883 the o face magazine llc writes its articles as a means of satire and when read in full the article in question openly discusses college themed issues between a male and female perspective in absolutely no way does the article in question claim to inflict rape or sexual violence against women
5398884 we believe it is our constitutional right to publish the college themed issues in a college forum our magazines are clearly aimed at those who have the mental capability and intelligence to read our articles and take them for nothing more than they are pure satire
5398885 many of the stores that were indicated as supporters of the o face magazine llc are not affiliated with the magazine in any way other than allowing us to place magazines in their places of business some of the locations listed never had magazines distributed to them

5399006 my aunt phoned us and told us to turn off all lights at home so that the attackers would think nobody was home we heard that many chinese women became victims of gang rape
5399007 at that time i always brought an islamic veil with me people told me that kind of trick worked to save chinese women from attackers
5399008 otherwise the legitimate process of politics and governance will always be subverted by shadowy forces who rule civil society through the use of terror

5399020 every california child deserves a quality education and parents should have the right to decide whats best for their children
5399021 parents should not be penalized for acting in the best interests of their childrens education this outrageous ruling must be overturned by the courts and if the courts dont protect parents rights then as elected officials we will

5399024 the law is accurate it hasnt changed since the 1950s

5399026 oconnells is an encouraging statement and we think it will have important implications for the court decision

5399209 the entire legacy of a plant hinges on never shortchanging this even with the onslaught of new applications

5399269 fishbein had written an excoriating editorial in jama titled hoxsey cancer charlatan
5399270 when hoxsey employed physicians to give his treatment texas courts revoked their licenses and forbade him from operating a clinic when he turned the clinic over to someone else fda secured a court order requiring the hoxsey clinic to write individually to all patients and inform them that the treatment was no longer available the final blow came on october 29 1958 when the fda simultaneously padlocked his clinics in a single day
5399271 in no way did harry have the money to fight that state by state
5399272 a dallas judge ruled in federal court that hoxseys therapy was comparable to surgery radium and x ray in its effectiveness without the destructive side effects of those treatments hoxsey faced unrelenting opposition and harassment from a hostile medical establishment the ama nci and fda organized a conspiracy to suppress a fair unbiased assessment of hoxseys methods according to a 1953 report to congress
5399273 today substantial laboratory data indicates that the hoxsey herbal tonic could have genuine value against cancer
5399274 thousands of patients believe it saved their lives there is no dispute that the hoxsey remedies for external cancer are effective over the course of this century numerous prominent figures including senators congressmen judges and even doctors have affirmed hoxseys reputed cures and repeatedly called for an investigation why then has it taken so long the answer is buried in medical politics it revolves around a fierce trade war fought over money as well as fundamental conflict of medical opinion its consequence has been the exclusion and outright suppression of hoxsey as well as numerous other unorthodox cancer therapies
5399275 since the early 1970s when president nixon declared the war on cancer two trillion dollars have been spent on conventional cancer treatment and research with the result that more americans are dying of cancer than ever before

5399347 if the powerpoint presentation was the smoking gun that blew away diane byrums and michigan afl cio president mark gaffneys assertion that the ballot initiative was somehow a bi partisan reform proposal the creation date of the powerpoint presentation proves conclusively that rmgn was required to file as a ballot question committee in 2007 not as they did on february 22 2008 when their statement of organization was filed with the secretary of state
5399348 if rmgn had registered back in 2007 as required they would have been required to file an annual report that was due january 31 2008 disclosing their contributors and expenditures
5399349 a research project of that scope has been estimated by other pollsters to cost at least 75 000 100 000 or more well over the 500 threshold that requires registration as a ballot question committee

5399488 police held us and tried to arrest us but other demonstrators came to help and manged to take us away from the police

5399502 i just read the nist report here is my expert analysis of why page x paragraph y is wrong
5399503 i know thats what it looks like but id like to see an analysis
5399504 this is very important im going to take my analysis to the police mainstream media insurance companies etc instead of just anonymously posting on an internet forum
5399505 when you put it that way it does sound a little silly
5399506 whoa i just checked the date on this bbc article its over five years old good thing i caught that before i posted it that would have been embarassing
5399507 so me and my buddies were camping last weekend just for laughs i tossed a beer can into the fire when no one was looking a couple seconds later it went off like a hand grenade and everyone else shat themselves while i laughed my ass off what are you thick or something i said like a hand grenade stop overreacting youre making a fool of yourself
5399508 maybe i should look further by studying the science and not just reading what fellow conspiracy theorists tell me
5399509 holy crap american free press is full of anti semtic gibberish maybe i should stop using it as source material
5399510 you mean someone can actually dislike bush and still think that my 911 theories are junk

5399512 my physics degree really doesnt qualify me to make engineering judgements
5399513 hey librarian could you tell me where to find the peer reviewed journals
5399514 having actually contacted the eyewitnesses to see what the meant when they said
5399515 im letting my hatred of bush get the better of me
5399516 i confess i dont know what the hell im talking about
5399517 ive been wrong 280 times really geez i must think next time before i post
5399518 maybe a structural engineer has a better grasp on how a building would collapse than charlie sheen would
5399519 now that you have defeated one of my arguments i will be sure to not use that argument again as though nothing ever happened
5399520 id like to stick to solid numbers and math instead of just personal incredulity
5399521 im taking all of this undisputed evidence of an inside job to the authorities
5399522 media reports from the day after the attacks shouldnt be quoted as gospel
5399523 asking questions alone is meaningless heres my theory about what happened on 9 11

5399532 if im ever arrested for a serious crime i sure hope the prosecutor uses the same standards of evidence that i do
5399533 i followed up on all that evidence you presented the other day heres what i found
5399534 heres a list of buildings that were demolished with explosives after being heavily damaged and burning for hours
5399535 remember that the executive summaries are only summaries the meat of the evidence is in the other 9 500 pages

5399539 im thankful to live in a country that allows me to fully express my own beliefs about 9 11
5399540 i dont have any background in explosives physics aviation construction so ill defer to the judgment of people whove studied it their whole lives
5399541 im sorry that you disagree with my 9 11 evidence but i respect your right to have a differing opinion
5399542 whew im so busy i dont have free time for anything
5399543 before i post this conspiracy question on an internet forum maybe i should do a web search to see if its been addressed already

5399551 i suppose the phrase pull it could have more than one possible interpretation
5399552 well if you take the basic kinematic equations and plug in the mass and velocity of the jet
5399553 you know maybe shouting through a megaphone at ground zero on 9 11 isnt the best way to attract people to our movement
5399554 maybe i should figure out what thermite and thermate are before i talk about them so much
5399555 maybe there are some federal agents who arent two dimensional villians from a steven segal movie
5399556 to be fair that quote is taken out of context

5399564 oh the cctv cam had a 2 pics per second framerate well that does explain why there are might be no good frames of the aircraft
5399565 yes when we extrapolate from the hole in the wall to the light poles it is consistent with a large aricraft approaching at a flat angle and low altitude i guess we cant take the fdr altimeter readings at face value then
5399566 yes i realize that officials did not have to cancel travels on 9 11 if they were in on it theyd have known which planes to avoid or they wouldnt have booked them in the first place
5399567 no i agree that the fireball is not consistent with a he missile warhead

5399592 zu fragen w re worin oder wodurch antisemitismus berhaupt beweisbar sein kann schlie lich handelt es sich hier nicht um eine mathematische gleichung sondern um eine pathische projektion allein darum weil das identifizieren selbst dem wahnhaften bewu tsein entspringt ist die suche nach den motiven immer mehr als eine detektivische aktivit t als ideologiekritisches und zugleich psychoanalytisches verfahren kann sie von einem spekulativen moment nicht absehen selbst dort wo wirklich alles manifest geworden ist
5399593 denn der antisemit findet immer einen grund sich in stellung gegen die juden zu bringen nicht was der jude tut oder unterl t regt auf sondern dass es den juden gibt
5399594 part of the whole national failure on human trafficking has been the historic approach to prostitution once youve arrested somebody for prostitution too often that represents the end of the case as far as law enforcement is concerned
5399595 usually its not some international multi ethnic ring with hundreds of victims
5399596 usually its a couple of guys and couple of victims typically it doesnt get much attention
5399597 i sort of had an idea what was going on in the world but this was a real shock to me
5399598 it was just so contrary of what i knew of him i knew of him as this anti trafficking hero

5399607 so far we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in
5399608 when officers went there they said it was like stepping into a place frozen in time
5399609 the cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades nothing had been disturbed for decades even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there

5399613 what goes into the ground is very different from the compound in the chicken feed
5399614 that the organic arsenic transforms much faster means we could get a bolus of the stuff going through the groundwater aquifer
5399615 this paper wont convince the fda but the body of work out there may move it to act
5399616 some big u s companies raise chickens without using roxarsone and appear to manage
5399617 theres never been any showings of human health risks from the addition of small amounts of roxarsone to the feed
5399618 we believe roxarsone is safe however public criticism of the product in recent years led to public misunderstanding and prompted us to suspend using it
5399619 we dont want there to be any question about the safety of the food we produce
5399620 im selling a million birds a week and i feed them what i would want to eat
5399621 i am concerned about the potential contamination of groundwater with inorganic arsenic in maryland because we have a lot of poultry farms and most people here get their drinking water from groundwater
5399622 has no data to suggest that there have been any adverse health effects in humans

5399645 tax is addressed to religion not to the public benefice or infrastructures
5399646 this is simply a lie muhammad was very well known for his generosity to all living being including non muslim in one case there was once a blind jewish beggar who kept cursing muhammad in medina and say bad things about him what he did in return was he make sure the beggar is well fed he will even fed the beggar himself all without revealing his identity at all to him when muhammad died abu bakr decided to try to continue his habits including feeding this beggar the beggar however instantly noticed he screamed that abu bakr is not the usual person that the previous one was treating him with more care amp gentleness this made abu bakr to cry and he revealed that it was muhammad who was giving the charity to him its easy to predict that the beggar was deeply touched by all this and at the end he converted to islam these are what muhammad has been teaching to all of us compassion to others excellent manners its a pity that many muslims missed it and therefore causing others to hate us we need to sort out our act and the sooner the better indeed re misinformation against islam there are so many others out there its so easy to create a lie thered be no way id be able to counter all of them but the point of this post is to implore you dear readers to not blindly belief everything god has given us brain for us to use not to be disused to those who doesnt belief in god then please examine the quote from thomas paine which ive mentioned at the beginning in this post it will help ensure our your own well being hope you have found this post useful this entry was posted on friday july 4th 2008 at 8 27 and is filed under misinformation on propaganda against islam

5399649 the source its from many places really cant point to any particular book its mostly from my own experiences dabbling with atheists
5399650 yeah i was curious to find out the mindset of our atheists friends so i decided to hangout in one of its popular forum some people will call it suicide and i did got harassed pretty badly there
5399651 but it greatly opened my eyes i found out that not all atheists are equal some are truly great men i learned quite a lot from them especially in logics amp common sense i learned critical thinking i found new perspectives and many other lessons which i doubt i can obtain from my current environment
5399652 some unfortunately are bullies which enjoy degrading others together with their pack i used to be bothered greatly by them so i can understand tios comment up there but thankfully not so much now these people are not worth your time since most of the stuff theyre spewing are pure crap

5399684 the south american cup competition came hurriedly to life in 2002 in the depths of the continents economic depression the tournament which had previously occupied the second half of the year lost its sponsorship and folded the south american cup began as a quick mend and make do replacement the format then is home and away knockout right from the start and in the first rounds the dominant principle is the need to keep travel costs down the brazilians play amongst themselves as do the argentines all the others face teams from a neighbouring country for example of paraguays two representatives one travels north to meet a team from bolivia the other goes south to uruguay and so on
5399685 je pousse un peu plus mes roughs histoire de pas tourner en rond
5399686 you do not know what a terrible day i have had
5399687 even before the sun begins his day i begin mine walking from village to village plying my trade to anyone who has the time to give me of their time and what do i come home with
5399688 i walked so much i now have to re sole my shoes
5399689 i know that i was there on the donkey when we reached the village to the west all the villagers came out of their homes to see what we had to touch the crockery i had so lovingly made but then i heard one whisper that i should be ashamed of myself for using my donkey to carry my wares and myself and my son i learnt from that and when i traveled into the next village it was different but wife again i heard the whispers that i should be ashamed of myself for walking beside my donkey whilst my donkey carried the weight of my wares and my son i tell you i could not wait until i left that village only a handful of my crockery did i barter before i left for the village to the east when i arrived holding my son in my arms and me walking beside our donkey the villagers there laughed at me for wearing thin the soles of my shoes and not riding with my son on my donkey
5399690 miserable and lost i gained nothing today but sore feet and worn out shoes
5399691 i helped pa tie all the wares to the donkey and pa let me ride him and held onto me when i was scared and then he let me ride him on my own and then he let me walk beside him and we walked so so much ma and my feet dont hurt much do you know why ma
5399692 i knew i needed to gather a lot of information before choosing a school but i really didnt know where to start
5399693 the mba tour gives you enough of the sense of the culture of each school that you can get a good idea whether its right for you
5399694 you can hit a lot of schools in one or two days
5399695 for someone like me who really had no idea where i wanted to go it was extremely helpful
5399696 we find that people think an economic slowdown is a good time to go back to school so they start looking into it
5399697 but it peaks early in a recession if the recession drags on and on as it did from 2001 to 2004 you begin to see fewer full time b school applications because people decide not to leave their jobs
5399698 we find people are very interested in learning about financial aid and scholarships that are available
5399699 its also a chance to meet some alumni of schools you may be considering who often participate in the discussions

5399714 with strong visuals custom artwork and innovative gameplay design arizona stands out not only as one of the best tug of war maps seen yet for world in conflict but also as one of the strongest community projects to date
5399715 because of a strong sense of visuals and a solid understanding of good gameplay this map stands out as one of the best assault maps weve seen so far good use of props and a keen eye for detail lift this above many others and make it a real winner many maps fail by trying to be too complicated this one succeeds because it does a great job of being simple fun
5399716 visual polish and a powerful use of advanced atmospheric effects make this map into something special indeed a lot of effort has been put into making the mood lighting and subtle shifts of battlefield ambience the basis of a terrific play experience all of these things combine to make the best use of directx 10 weve seen in a user made map

5399718 pakistani actions have forced us once again to doubt the sincerity of the pakistani premiers comments because experience has shown that pakistan does the opposite of what it says
5399719 the decision by those countries to use afghanistan as a platform for their long standing hostility is unacceptable and unjustifiable
5399720 uncoordinated and arbitrary operations especially by us troops have spurred feelings against foreign troops in the country and convinced the people to help the taleban

5399734 receding permafrost in russia proof that the planet is warming
5399735 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth
5399736 as they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several years a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part of a global climatic upheaval
5399737 the facts of the present climate change global cooling are such that the most optimistic experts would assign near certainty to major crop failure in a decade

5399744 theres a dearth of good information about iraq given the security situation
5399745 what we really need are iraqis to tell their own stories of survival
5399746 at this point theres really no choice because western journalists cant get around at all
5399747 as iraq becomes more and more difficult to work in and more and more important in the region that information vacuum becomes larger
5399748 theres a lot to be said for that immediate gut reaction
5399749 youve got to realize there is not one perfect school for anyone
5399750 i dont know if this exhibition was for me or someone else in this country since the gas price has been skyrocketed and unimaginable inflation is here we all nepalese live a life that is populated corrupt and toiled to twist anyones brain now its time to not only to boost tourism but boost employment provide some sort of relief to elders such as me and my husband who is in his 70s i alone can not make ends meet and the government needs to do something about elders of this nation many of them abandoned by sons or daughters neglected by the government you ask me have i been to the exhibition why she replied
5399751 they always do one thing or another its all for travellers and those seeking their names in news headlines unless you boost the economy of this nation every exhibition for us is like a slap on our face first we have a new baby a government backed by the people put some money in my old dad and mums pocket then may be i could save money to travel i have to work pay college fee and look after my dad and mum and you expect me to have enough money to goto mustang
5399752 its like a show just like any other placed before solving any problems we face daily like the skyrocketing of cost of living tuition fees and so on
5399753 those who have money dont even know our countrys beauty but our employers dont give us any holidays at all i am hoping our labor board gets serious on private companies that treat employees in inhumane way such as working under a bond no holidays and so on for all year around pension are you kidding me there needs to be a connection between all boards and there is a lack of communication and leadership as well we dont have qualified people on the right chairs to do the job right i am hoping that they pass some kind of bill that makes it easier for all those who work in private companies do you know some of them dont even give sick leaves
5399754 so far we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in

5399756 the cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades nothing had been disturbed for decades even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there

5399758 having its entire output available will be a benefit for electric customers in the carolinas
5399759 if were ever going to slow and eventually reverse global warming the world has got to move to energy sources that dont emit carbon and other greenhouse gases
5399760 nuclear energy is the best commercially available technology today to produce large amounts of electricity with no greenhouse gases

5399779 the rankings show a distinct pattern of insurance industry greed amongst 10 companies that refuse to pay just claims employ hardball tactics against policyholders reward executives with extravagant salaries and raise premiums while hoarding excessive profits
5399780 according to investigations and documents allstate was forced to make public the company systematically placed profits over its own policyholders
5399781 unum one of the nations leading disability insurers has long had a reputation for unfairly denying and delaying claims
5399782 aig executives have also come under fire for opportunistically seeking price increases during catastrophes now the company has been labeled the new enron because of charges of multibillion dollar corporate fraud

5399789 the mccain camp didn t respond instead it leaked mccain s article to the drudge report yesterday with the spin that the times had run obama but would not run mccain
5399790 thus the times and members of its news department and editorial page staff share an interest in avoiding conflicts of interest or an appearance of a conflict
5399791 the clunkiest thing i have heard in a long time
5399792 the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq
5399793 but its not pro obama bias in the news media thats driving the effusion of coverage its the news mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
