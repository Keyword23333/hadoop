4530012 i never walk under or near that building ever since a can of paint fell from above one day while i was under the scaffold and about to cross the street it landed about 3 ft from me and crumpled from the impact last summer frisbee size chunks of drywall were raining down for almost and hour before someone came to inspect and that was only 2 months after large full bottles of poland spring water came falling down onto pedestrians on sixth ave on both sides of the street and 911 asked if i considered it an emergency well if someone gets bonked on the head and passes out does that qualify it there were no wind nets to hold in debris within the building floors does someone need to be crushed by a cement block or loose 3 ton ac unit for them to be even investigated
4530013 i have to laugh a the hypocrisy of state elected officials who complain about fare increases that are largely due to the borrowing they approved during the pataki administration which shifted the mta s capital costs stations rolling stock etc from the state and city and placed it largely on the backs of the farepayers how many people realize that the m t a now has to pay over 150 million each month because of the irresponsible borrowing which like those now famous subprime mortgages began with low up front payments that way the increases didn t kick in until after the 2002 election the real culprit is not the m t a it s the politicians who kick the can down the road for the next administration to worry about
4530014 you would think that in the face of all of this evidence that our economy is seriously failing that the people in leadership positions would stop lying and admit that things are worst than they have been in my entire lifetime i am 28 but they keep telling us that everything is going moderately well we are facing serious and scary times and we are being told that everything is fundamentally strong

4530062 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
4530063 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
4530064 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
4530065 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range

4530067 a lot of people base their opinions on the equivalent of urban legends stories that are so powerful that you assume they are incontrovertible but which may not actually be true
4530068 people are afraid of radioactivity because it is invisible and unknown
4530069 but that doesnt mean that we cant detect and work with it part of this wariness is that people dont trust the government when it says dont worry well they dont have to trust the government they can actually learn what levels of radioactivity are and what they cause and make their own judgment
4530070 is outside the purview of physics but policy should be based on facts and understanding

4530081 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4530082 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4530083 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4530084 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4530085 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired

4530088 youre pitching against one of the best if not the best pitchers in the league when hes healthy thats fun
4530089 it was a fun game to be a part of what a big day for the guys to come back and rally against a guy like ben sheets any time you have a match up like that you know runs are going to be at a premium
4530090 sheets has got real good stuff but in my at bats he gave me some good pitches to hit and fortunately i was able to do something with them
4530091 its been frustrating when our pitchers have had a real good game and we havent been able to support them it was nice to be able to come back score some runs and get jake a win
4530092 i thought it was a great match up of two premier pitchers
4530093 after the first couple of innings jake really started hitting his spots when we strung some hits together that was nice to see we hit the ball good that inning
4530094 they found some holes in the seventh hit a ball or two hard and put it where we werent i was probably off with my location a little bit you cant do anything about dinks and dunks

4530114 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4530115 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4530116 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4530117 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4530118 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4530119 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4530120 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4530121 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4530122 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4530123 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps

4530132 now the bereans were of more noble character than the thessalonians for they received the message with great eagerness
4530133 if all christians were to examine carefully what they read in books or hear even from the pulpit and check it against the infallible scriptures then error would have little freedom and space to circulate we would do well to examine everything we hear for the truthfulness of its content and not allow ourselves to be taken in by the attractiveness of its packaging

4530137 the government is going to help you in the best way possible by doing nothing for you by getting out of your way well i exaggerate but you understand of course we will provide you with infrastructure and help by getting rid of corruption but you have all succeeded by your own initiative and enterprise so you should congratulate yourselves
4530138 the first thing we did a few years ago when i became president we fired the entire police force of the country
4530139 when the soviet union collapsed when the cold war was over when i went to study in the u s and finally i realized my dream i never thought that this evil would come back again i never thought the kgb people would again try to run the world and thats exactly whats happening now what s at stake here is americas americas ideals if it will collapse in georgia it will collapse in other countries and in other places as well

4530157 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4530158 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4530159 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4530160 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4530161 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4530162 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4530163 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4530164 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4530165 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4530183 i dream of climbing denali my whole life was the outdoors before my injury
4530184 all i have done is dreamed about climbing a big mountain and since i got hurt it just made me want to do it even more to prove to myself i can overcome anything i will do whatever it takes to do this expedition
4530185 the most basic of things became a challenge writing my name putting on a pair of pants in the morning tying my shoes cutting a steak
4530186 after putting up a ceiling fan that spring with my 5 year old son i realized that as long as i was patient enough i could do whatever i wanted by the end of the year i was back doing many of the things i had before my injuries
4530187 realizing the deficiencies in arm prostheses i had begun work as an engineer on the darpa revolutionizing prosthetics 2009 program and started a non profit called the shared design alliance open prosthetics project to address the lack of innovation in arm prosthetics
4530188 climbing denali is a task that many able bodied folks would never undertake by being part of a team tackling that task while sharing the additional challenges of disability i hope to inspire others with similar challenges
4530189 i hope as well to remove the limits placed on their expectations of what they can achieve this wont make getting dressed eating or anything else any easier but its my hope that it will make any challenge seem possible and less of a chore to undertake
4530190 my wounds were so severe the average person would not have survived with a severed carotid artery being the worst of a mile long list of other injuries
4530191 the doctors at walter reed thought the left side of my body would be paralyzed because of the stroke i had suffered from my injuries after two weeks in icu and a remarkable recovery i am not paralyzed
4530192 i am not going to let my injuries prevent me from doing what i want to do in the future in the army or in life once my recovery is finished i plan on returning to full duty in the army and taking on whatever life throws at me
4530193 i plan on summiting denali in one years time with fellow warriors wounded in iraq i believe it would be the ultimate challenge for disabled war veterans to summit denali

4530218 if everyones doing rest this year it must be a winner
4530219 ive gathered the metrics that show my software development process is top class
4530220 of course buying that esb to kick start our soa initiative was a sensible thing to do
4530221 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4530222 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4530223 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy
4530224 the integration of peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4530225 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4530226 neil young on an acid trip encountering a far out hip hop dj entrenched in textural sounds and the rhythms of reggaeton garage amp american folk music somewhere out in retro futurist space
4530227 garage and psychedelic rock that is often reminiscent of the 60s and 70s the sampling culture and beat heavy elements of electronic genres and the lyrical style and sensibility of american folk music
4530228 we are trying to describe this answer to you we are trapped
4530229 these matters shook up the community now we are thinking a bit about everything
4530230 matt not that youd ever want to write about september 11th but say you did why would i ever want to hear about what some poet kid who has a garage rock band has to say about it when i could just type phrases into google about it and read everything from thousands of personal experience blogs about the event to government propaganda about it
4530231 sick beats found out about you guys from mariahs page
4530232 come cazzo si chiamava quel sito ricordo che era un acronimo
4530233 they tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow but how am i going to live there being so small and helpless
4530234 among the many angels i chose one for you she will be waiting for you and will take care of you
4530235 but tell me here in heaven i dont do anything else but sing and smile thats enough for me to be happy
4530236 your angel will sing for you and will also smile for you every day and you will feel your angels love and be happy
4530237 and how am i going to be able to understand when people talk to me
4530238 your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care your angel will teach you how to speak
4530239 and what am i going to do when i want to talk to you
4530240 your angel will place your hands together and will teach you how to pray
4530241 ive heard that on earth there are bad men who will protect me
4530242 your angel will defend you even if it means risking her life
4530243 but i will always be sad because i will not see you anymore
4530244 your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the way for you to come back to me even though i will always be next to you
4530245 oh god if i am about to leave now please tell me my angels name
4530246 your angels name is not hard to remember you will simply call her mommy
4530247 the hand who rocks the cradle may rock the world
4530248 have you put aside enough time for her to listen to her blues of working in the kitchen her tiredness

4530253 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4530254 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4530255 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy
4530256 the integration of peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4530257 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4530258 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4530259 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4530260 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4530261 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4530262 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4530263 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4530264 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4530265 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4530266 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4530267 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4530268 that common law right was held only by citizens and those who swore allegiance to the government

4530270 federal law generally bars gun possession by noncitizens who are here under a nonimmigrant visa
4530271 some state laws go further and ban all possession by noncitizens including by permanent residents
4530272 could be challenged even without reaching the question whether the second amendment is incorporated against the states
4530273 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4530274 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4530275 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4530276 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4530277 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4530278 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with

4530436 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4530454 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4530455 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4530508 a comprehensive model of the effect of a major meteor storm on earths ionosphere is presented the model includes meteor stream mass distributions based on visual magnitude observations a differential ablation model of major meteoric metals fe and mg and state of the art modeling of the chemistry and transport of meteoric metal atoms and ions subsequent to deposition particular attention is paid to the possibility of direct ionic deposition of metallic species the model is validated by calculating the effect of annual meteor showers on the background metal atom and ion abundances a metallic ion density increase of up to 1 order of magnitude is observed in agreement with in situ measurements during showers the model is exercised for a hypothetical leonid meteor storm of the magnitude reported in 1966 the model predicts the formation of a layer of metal ions in the ionospheric e region that reaches peak densities of around 1 x 105 cm 3 corresponding to a 2 order of magnitude increase of the quiescent nighttime e region density although sporadic e layers reaching or exceeding this density are relatively common the effect is different in that it persists on the order of days and would be observed over nearly one half the globe the model predictions are consistent with the available 1966 leonid storm data in particular the observation of enhanced predawn sporadic e activity points to efficient collisional ionization of meteoric metals as assumed in the model
4530509 more than 40 rocket flights through the main meteoric ionization layer which peaks near 95 km have sampled the meteoric metallic ion concentrations five of these flights were conducted during or near the peak times of a meteor shower in each of the latter studies the observed meteoric ion concentrations were assumed to be a consequence of the shower these measurements were not complemented by baseline observations made for similar ionospheric conditions immediately before the shower and no rigorous quantitative comparisons were made using average non shower distributions in order to further investigate the impact of the shower on the ionosphere all published ion concentration altitude profiles obtained from sounding rockets in the meteoric ionization regime have been scanned to develop a digital data base of meteoric ion concentrations these data are used to provide the first empirical altitude profile of the metallic ions the average observed mg concentrations are lower than those yielded by the most comprehensive model to date mcneil et al 1996 this compiled ensemble of data provides supporting evidence that meteor showers do have a significant impact on the average ionosphere composition although there is much variability in the observed meteoric layers the peaks in the total metallic ion concentrations at mid latitudes on the dayside observed during meteor showers had concentrations comparable to or exceeding the highest concentrations measured in the same altitude regions during non shower periods

4530904 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4531041 it is an honor to host congressman blunt in the fifth district and showcase the alternative energy initiatives taking place in our area this visit is a perfect working example of an all of the above energy policy that house republicans are working to pass in congress as we speak
4531042 these facilities are just another example of the type of alternative fuels that republicans in congress are on the floor promoting everyday

4531047 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4531048 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4531049 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4531050 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4531051 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4531052 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4531053 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4531054 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4531055 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4531086 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully touch wood i will be able to do that
4531087 its been tough the toughest part of my career so far definitely

4531089 the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt fit at the time
4531090 then he doesnt really know the history of everything that comes with it i admit it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4531091 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4531092 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4531093 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us
4531094 weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it
4531095 there are 38 games and everyone is tough you have to be willing to grind out results when youre not playing so well and get results away from home

4531104 the main thing they are after is to get recognition of olusegun obasanjo presidential library as unesco category 2 which would entitle it to receive funds from nigerian government annual subsidy as well as soliciting funds for cultural affairs from private sector international organisations and so on
4531105 on the transfer of the archives of ulli and georgina bier to a newly to be created ulli and georgina bier centre as part of an institute for black culture and international understanding under the auspices of unesco which was dated 10th of may 2007
4531106 this is the mou signed between dr babalola borishade the then minister of culture and tourism representing the federal government of nigeria and ulli and georgina bier in the process of that mou however one or two interesting paragraphs which are inserted showed that everything had been from the beginning programmed towards this end
4531107 subsequently gen obasanjo then president instructed dr mike omolewa our representative at unesco and one other person to negotiate wi9th ulli biers for the transfer of their archives and incorporate into oopl that to me is an abuse of office it is a clear case of abuse of office
4531108 to order the transfer of materials to be paid for from public funds to some ones personal library i dont care whether it is called presidential library or not is an abuse of office
4531109 until the eve of departure he ordered public servants which omolewa was one to start the process of transferring archives to be paid for from public funds to his personal library
4531110 the understanding with georgina and ulli bier was that their archives should be housed in special centre to be created in oshogbo and called ulli and georgina foundation for international understanding

4531128 it is outrageous that bat is still conducting itself this way just weeks after a bbc documentary revealed how the corporation had been marketing cigarettes to children across africa and how it had used parties and concerts to lure people to smoking
4531129 besides there was heavy presence of bouncers at the venues but girls especially the young ones were allowed to get into the party without any check there were free cigarettes at the gate and young persons were compelled to light and smoke cigarettes before entering while there were many more sticks given out during the course of the party there was also dancing competition with music ipod being the star prize while other consolation prices include packs of pall mall cigarettes and lighters and no one was allowed to enter the venue with a camera we were shocked to discover that people holding the invitation cards were compelled to light up before entering the event venue after which the invitation cards were withdrawn and confiscated there were also scarcely branded girls handing out free cigarettes most of the girls were less than 18 years and were using all tricks to influence people to smoke it is outrageous it should stop this is not what we want for our youths

4531160 i have to keep giving myself chances but it all comes down to putting
4531161 i have to be more aggressive then i was today i played it a bit too safe out there
4531162 i struggled on the putting on the back nine but overall i hit the ball pretty well

4531198 it is simple young spartan you know that ephialtes was killed by a man named athenades some 9 or 10 years after the battle of thermopylae athenades was rewarded by the spartans although he claimed he did not know who ephialtes was and his death resulted in some type of argument i can tell you however that athenades was a close friend of mine i had decided that despite my loathing for the spartans their arrogance and brutality i needed to make amends with my failure towards your father and knowing how spartans prize violence and revenge it became my lifes mission to track down ephialtes he moved around often and tried to not garner too much attention but athenades was remarkably persistent and although we both had nothing to thank the spartans for we were both pleased when athenades finally tracked ephialtes down he had to make it seem that the death was a result of an altercation and not premeditated and he was successful athenades could live with the money that sparta rewarded him with and i could live with the knowledge your father and the comrades he held most dear were avenged
4531199 it seems corydallus your hate of the spartans does not exceed your admiration for our values
4531200 you are wrong dorieus i am not the least bit proud of what i have done since i have dedicated my life to saving others and not killing them i betrayed myself in order to atone for my failure towards your father in the end i failed doubly i know that now live to be old and learn some wisdom with the passing years you are a typical spartan full of supposedly noble values and laws but addicted to violence and with no capacity to think for yourself you will kill many more men after this day but i have one death on my conscience and it weighs more than all the lives i might have saved as a physician lives like in your case that will sooner or later result in more useless deaths it is a vicious cycle that i will now finally end

4531204 i work at a school immokalee high school the reason im writing is about tax dollars being spent for the new astro turf football field there and one other collier county high school im so dissappointed sic with the decision because several buildings on campus including the one the main office is in and the one my classroom is located in have air conditioning that barely works here we are an f school in the middle of being restructured by nclb and i had to buy fans for my room last year because it is so hot in there how can we expect the kids to stay awake be alert or learn when they are miserable i can not believe astro turf is an appropriate use of my tax dollars but especially when the a c need so very much attention there are schools around the country whose athletic booster clubs raised the money for turf why should tax payers be paying for it anyway thanks for letting me vent

4531243 i dont want in any way to seem critical of the generation of leadership who fought so i could be sitting here
4531244 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
4531245 but its like watching something that youve been working on all your life sort of come together right before your eyes and you cant see it
4531246 its like youve been building the great wall of china and you finally put that last stone in and you cant see it you just cant see the enormity of it
4531247 he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
4531248 but youve got to learn one basic lesson youre trying to start at the top and you cant start at the top in politics
4531249 i dont think a group with 435 members can be the top of anything
4531250 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
4531251 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
4531252 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
4531253 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
4531254 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues
4531255 i want people to ask me about nonproliferation i want them to run to me to speak about the situation in the middle east
4531256 i dont want to be the person thats turned to when cnn talks about black leaders
4531257 so obamas the first one out there on the ice
4531258 this campaign is giving other african americans like myself the courage to be themselves
4531259 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
4531260 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
4531261 internal polling in both campaigns after iowa showed obama suddenly garnering closer to 75 or 80 percent of the black vote in primary states
4531262 i grew up in the south where men like barack obama who right now is older than bill clinton was when he ran for president were called boy
4531263 there was something about the condescension on his face when he said it and the dismissiveness in his voice
4531264 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings
4531265 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
4531266 i think there was a lot of sensitivity some warranted and some unwarranted
4531267 its based on your life experience and its generational you know if you have a sore on your arm you dont necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain you can touch another part of your arm youve still got a certain sensitivity to it so if race is the sensitive thing then anything that even gets close to it sounds like it looks like it feels like it is it
4531268 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
4531269 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
4531270 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
4531271 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing
4531272 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
4531273 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
4531274 this isnt a struggle that began in the 1930s or 1960s its a struggle that began in 1620 its a struggle against slavery and its children
4531275 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
4531276 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
4531277 things are changing from where they were 30 years ago the fights are changing and you have an infrastructure thats not producing results look at the incarceration rates the difference between whites and blacks what are the old organizations accomplishing
4531278 there are some members who need to go or to update and be accountable
4531279 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
4531280 shes poised to be one of the most influential people in politics and particularly among african americans in politics
4531281 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
4531282 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
4531283 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
4531284 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
4531285 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around
4531286 youre constantly tested by a whole host of factors to see whether youre speaking for the entire commonwealth or just for one community
4531287 i dont fit in any box and i think thats what the electorate has had to learn about me
4531288 yes but its not good enough for me to have the reaction that you just did to say im the governor not the mayor
4531289 you wouldnt believe how many times in the last few days people have stuck microphones in my face to ask my opinion about jesse jacksons comments
4531290 all i have to be is as good a human being and as good a governor as i can be and the rest will take care of itself

4531315 la supremazia aerea avrebbe permesso di esercitare sul giappone una pressione sufficiente a costringere il paese a una resa senza condizioni e a renderne superflua linvasione
4531316 il giappone si sarebbe arreso anche se non fossero state sganciate le due bombe atomiche anche se la russia non fosse entrata in guerra e anche se non fosse stata pianificata linvasione del paese
4531317 non fu fatto nessuno sforzo e non fu mai presa in seria considerazione la possibilit di ottenere la resa del nemico in modo da non dover usare la bomba

4531326 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4531327 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4531328 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4531329 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4531330 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4531331 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4531332 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4531333 the contract is a broad positive for solar in general where stocks have been in malaise despite what we thought were good earnings as it demonstrates the potential of photovoltaics in the utility market
4531334 the optisolar part of this contract demonstrates amorphous silicon low efficiency can be a utility scale solution and is a longer term positive for applied materials amat
4531335 sunpowers central message for the last two years has been enabling grid parity through 50 to 60 cost reductions by 2012
4531336 signing such a large agreement at apparently very low price levels signals sunpowers high level of confidence that it can sell large volumes of pv systems at prices substantially below current levels and still generate target margins
4531337 we continue to believe that utility scale projects such as this 800 megawatt announcement need initial support in the way of tax incentives to help utilities achieve an increasing percentage of their power deliveries from renewables

4531346 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
4531347 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible

4531403 my daughter is 12 and she has been on bebo for at least 18 months and i think every single one of her friends is and spends hours on it
4531404 i shall plainly have to go and talk to her
4531405 we still need to educate parents and young people about using the internet safely
4531406 its been really exciting to feel like im part of this bigger movement
4531407 the macarthur grants are some of the most prestigious a faculty member can receive this speaks volumes for the quality of professor barabs work and that of his learning sciences colleagues
4531408 the quest atlantis project has certainly had international impact already and it will only grow with this funding
4531409 but then after we used the program we found its so much more valuable than that
4531410 it cuts across all learning styles all levels theres sort of something for everyone
4531411 what are the challenges we will notice if we go to train teachers in north carolina as opposed to a group of teachers in shanghai or a group of teachers in lagos nigeria
4531412 its much simpler if im just going to my backyard and working with teachers and kids i know and i can go sit down and talk with those parents
4531413 but what happens when i take those issues and a child in china is going to take up this story or in bangladesh or in india
4531414 do i really want the storytellers that are educating my children to be sony blizzard and electronic arts
4531415 i think there are a lot of wonderful games out there that have good messages but i think we as educators need to enter that market and start to develop compelling stories that kids will want to adopt
4531416 do i really want the story tellers that are educating my children to be sony blizzard electronic arts i think there are a lot of wonderful games out there that have good messages but i think we as educators need to enter that market and start to develop compelling stories that kids will want to adopt in addition to those commercial ones what this grant allows us is to kind of enter that game to bring up the quality of our software to bring up the quality of our storylines and then ultimately to show to the commercial industry that you can actually develop a space that will not be used by 5 or 600 because no budgets going to allow that but by 30 to 40 000 kids worldwide
4531417 so i think games offer us something that traditional curriculum really is missing and a lot of the way schools are arranged with walls where oh we go in here and were going to do mathematics for 45 minutes and the reasons why we do mathematics well thats somewhere outside thats not here youre going to use it later on so you really should know it but with a game we can bring those worlds into the classroom make those available to kids so we can travel to tanzania or into a van gogh painting within that 45 minutes that they have to do science or to do art
4531418 theyre collecting data and having to make decisions about how to operate in these worlds well the teachers role is incredibly necessary in a lot of the research we looked at what is the teachers role in these spaces because of the big fear of are the games going to replace the teacher what we found is exactly the opposite its really hard to make a game that a kid cant click on and move through and kind of win with a cheat code so what the teachers do is they really get kids to think deeply about what theyre submitting about the questions that are going on in a space about what science is necessary to make sense of it
4531419 whats exciting about being part of macarthurs views on changing part of media literacy is you feel like youre part of something bigger than your own research i just got back from a meeting at the macarthur foundation and there was a sense that we were on the edge of something really big and they were trying to kind of break out of the box to expose the world to new types of literacy to new ways that kids can learn that ultimately could change us from the notion that theres this kind of content that was done by these people who are now dead and your job is to acquire it to switch us to tools to help kids become producers to become critical creators not just simply consumers of information that theyre taught not to question
4531420 continuation of the sense that lower oil and commodity prices are going to drive down inflation
4531421 head off the necessity for the fed to raise rates anytime soon
4531422 maybe theyre just a crew of guys who do this for a living
4531423 our differences made it hard for us to deal with the situations and he decided to take care of it his way
4531424 im living day to day and if i stay at a motel room im lucky to scrape up enough money to pay for the room and not eat for days at a time just cause i need a roof over my head
4531425 the number of homeless is increasing in central florida if you consider the population over the least three years the greatest increase has been in veterans and families with children
4531426 the hardest thing is transportation not having a phone not having contacts and obviously a place to stay cause you know without hygiene no ones gonna hire you
4531427 you still have to have a really competent teacher but what this does is transform teaching practice
4531428 initially there was teacher resistance now there is no resistance because they see technology as a tool
4531429 if you want to improve kids learning theyve got to be interested if you dont have that forget it

4531437 if a bear walks in the office i know what to do
4531438 we have no choice but to change our strategy the alternatives we have are either to use two receivers or one receiver and two opposites we will decide which one to use match after match
4531439 our team is used to changing strategy and switching players as that is what we have done throughout the grand prix this year
4531440 they are in a good mood we have been waiting for the start of the games for a long time not only the match against russia but the start of the olympics in general
4531441 unfortunately it agueros departure has happened now we have to react and to think about what to do to make up for it coming to the olympics after many international successes has already been an amazing result for us
4531442 im glad to be here today our purpose is to see what international competition is like we can learn from this experience for future training we hope we can get good development in the future
4531443 of course it will be very difficult as we dont have any experience but we have our target set on winning a medal we hope to do our very best
4531444 although we didnt get a good result at the most recent grand prix weve recovered weve summarised our problems and recovered our physical strength however kun feng and ruirui zhao havent yet reached their best level after recent injuries
4531445 as there are very strong teams its a good opportunity to gain some experience and i wish all the teams good health
4531446 were very excited for the first match we hope for a great performance for the fans of the world and also we would like to have a great result
4531447 we have had a different preparation compared to athens i started coaching brazil in 2003 so the team that went to athens had been prepared mostly by brazils former coach
4531448 with this group i started a new cycle of work and during these last four years we have played about 140 matches at official and unofficial tournaments after which we have defined this squad
4531449 i think there is balance among the girls we have a strong group and this is positive on one side because you can keep the rhythm beating strong teams from the beginning of the games on the other hand qualifying for the quarterfinals is what counts but to win at the quarterfinals is the most important thing
4531450 we aim for a medal for reaching the podium having performed well at the grand prix doesnt say too much about our level though because many teams were not at full strength italy played without simona gioli and then also without antonella del core cuba played without nancy carrillo and rosir calderon usa were also not competing with the whole team
4531451 i think this team is more versatile than the one that played in athens these girls can play in different roles they are technically more complete this is what we have been focusing on
4531452 she and fernanda have the same level they are both high level players it doesnt change too much for our game
4531453 it is an honour to be here we are a new team so we take it as a good chance to learn from this experience
4531454 im glad to be here i feel satisfied to have qualified for the olympic games our dream is to win a medal but our first goal is to reach the quarterfinals after that we will talk about a medal we hope to do our best
4531455 we are cherishing this opportunity weve made all possible preparations and the team is ready to achieve its best result
4531456 you cannot predict the final a lot of teams here represent very tough competition our aim is to get the gold medal

4531464 we played a very good game today particularly in the first two sets but in the third set our rhythm was not controlled and our co ordination was not satisfactory it was lucky that we recovered our concentration and co ordination in the fourth set
4531465 we went into the game knowing this tragedy had happened and also knew that four years had gone into this we came into the tournament playing wonderful usa volleyball some of the greatest this decade this is about the team not individual people
4531466 its been pretty emotional for the last 24 hours its a game out there nothing compared to what happened to our team the best thing we could do was to come out here and try to play volleyball
4531467 at first we were feeling a little bit nervous but then we could control the situation on the court in the third set we made a lot of mistakes and let our opponents into the game however we defeated them in the end
4531468 we are trying not to create tension in the team i spotted alexey verbov playing computer games before the match of course computer games are not the real thing but i think it gave some players a chance to calm down
4531469 we have to get up at six then we warm up the real awakening comes after the first set of the match
4531470 i think the positive point is that the team played very seriously we concentrated and we rebuilt confidence even if in certain parts we didnt play too well i think we played our average
4531471 today we played a very big match our attack was really good but the key was digging in very balanced moments our setter pawel zagumny played well tactically in his distribution this match was very important our pool is really tough this match means a lot not only because it was the first one but for the qualification now we have two days to rest and prepare the next match
4531472 the world doesnt see us as the favourite anymore but just as a good contender it works in a way because it takes pressure away but the other teams are now more confident in playing against brazil
4531473 weve been dealing with the pressure for a long time there was a lot of pressure we had to deal with before the olympics a lot of demands it was not the right moment to play in brazil in the world league
4531474 we made many changes since the world league and serbia also changed a lot they played the final of the world league very well our defence has returned to a good level this is the most important thing for us because serbia attacks very well
4531475 we need to play the way we know how to play the brazilian press made a big deal about an argument we had during practice but thats the way we push each other to reach our goals
4531476 we are expecting another tough match against serbia maybe 3 2 we must play with patience and take advantage of their mistakes we have to play as a group

4531478 i really truly believe you work so hard and have come so far that nothing is going to get you off of your preparation
4531479 so you cant let any curveball thrown your way become a distraction if you do you will regret it do you really want to get derailed about anything
4531480 hugh is one of the strongest most resilient people i know
4531481 hes dealing with things as it goes along hes there for elisabeth
4531482 obviously to hear mccutcheons voice and get leadership from him hes always the guy steering and leading our squad helped
4531483 hes meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we hear from him
4531484 aguero is an excellent player and she is also very strong she is now in the great pain of losing her mother and she is also striving to recover from the sadness
4531485 i want to stress that she has been going through a hard time both mentally and physically during the past three days she had spent more time in the plane than on the ground but i believe she can recover gradually
4531486 aguero now is back which make us even more confident in the rest of the matches she has always been an important player of the team and we will also give her support to help get over the hard time
4531487 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court
4531488 this game was pretty difficult from the beginning we are very happy with this victory because its not easy to win the first match of the olympic games in the first set we made many net violations so we just tried little by little to make fewer errors
4531489 the first match of the olympic games is always difficult for any team in the first set we made many errors like the captain said we made errors in our attacks and blocking and service reception it took a lot of effort to block such high attacks from poland but we were very lucky to win the game in the end
4531490 this is not the first time for me performing in the olympics but in front of such a large cheering crowd we were very excited of course we still have some pressure on our shoulders but because of the home crowd our motivation is strong
4531491 this was our first match at the games weve been preparing for four years now the day we have been waiting for has finally come so were excited we had a good performance but we also made some errors and we hope to improve upon those in the future
4531492 we had a very difficult situation i told the players to concentrate on the game the game always goes on we have to be strong and make sure we play our game and play for the usa we were lucky because there were many supporters behind us we would like to thank them for that
4531493 i think that we played a very good match because we played with good rhythm the experience of the fivb world grand prix has been very important for us we played we won we lost we have a good rhythm in play im very proud of my players because theyve been able to play a very good match with a completely new formation its important to start the olympic games with an important victory
4531494 at the beginning our coordination was poor and then we improved and played better and better in the third set our concentration was really poor and we lost that set by the fourth set we started to improve at the end the most important thing is that we won this game
4531495 im very happy because my team played in a balanced fashion we were able to maintain good focus on attack and counter attack it was very important for us to start the tournament
4531496 it will be difficult to play russia we have equilibrium with eight teams here it was important for us to start well the next one russia is strongest and then serbia then kazakhstan and then italy every team here is very strong we will focus on the next game every time
4531497 i think we played a good game and we did what we needed to do we started playing superb when we find the right rhythm
4531498 we struggled with our receiving so we could not play our normal offense cuba did really well in serving today
4531499 the beginning of todays match was not very good we were not consistent and lost many points by errors i asked the players to calm down and they soon recovered from the hesitance and pressure at the opener
4531500 we have learnt a lot ffom our first match actually we will be competing with very strong opponents we are pleased of our first victory we based our game on teamwork and the players should play always as a team in the first set we didnt in future matches we should play as in the last sets
4531501 the hardest thing is to play a game when you are the clear favourite this is our first game playing against algeria they know how to play volleyball because most of the players are playing in france so we knew we had to concentrate especially when we are playing at such as early hour
4531502 we have continued to play good volleyball and have won again like our match with russia we played with attention good defence and few mistakes and we did so for nearly the entire match
4531503 aguero came back and she has participated in training sessions of course she is facing difficulties psychological and physical because she has spent so much time on planes and is very tired but she is recovering her rhythm and balance quickly
4531504 of course i am happy to win we did very well we played with concentration and consistency but its just the second round of play we have to keep working and do it step by step its very important
4531505 we played well from the beginning till the end we concentrated very well throughout the match

4531507 the start time is not only early for us but for italy too but there is a different mentality with russian teams regarding early matches as they tend to have an issue with fatigue
4531508 i have to persuade them and work hard to overcome this mentality and be prepared for tough matches but it seems that i fought here alone
4531509 our team and the brazilian team had very different experience they played a lot of high level international matches in the fivb world cup last year and fivb world grand prix this year while we did not qualify for either tournament
4531510 brazil gave us a lesson of volleyball today they played with double speed compared to russia they concentrated on their play and technically they were much better than russia
4531511 its a pity to lose again but i think we played better than we did in the last match
4531512 i just want to say that brazil is a very strong team and we had better concentration than the last match
4531513 it seems they have a problem inside but i dont know

4531515 watching it i felt like it had slowly lifted its leg on my brain
4531516 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
4531517 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
4531518 its a very sad moment for everyone wearing red white and blue
4531519 just sad they kind of informed us that it was an isolated event but whenever something that tragic happens your initial feeling is to want to be a little bit more secure wherever you go
4531520 once we got it out of our minds for a little bit we were able to focus and play volleyball
4531521 we had a difficult situation and we tried to tell our players to concentrate on the game
4531522 the tragedy that happened with the bachman family is something that could happen to anybody in the world unfortunately it happened to one of our teammates someone we hold close
4531523 this game was completely dedicated to wiz bachman and her family it was a great win for usa volleyball
4531524 you know there are a lot of things we cannot control
4531525 the thing we can control is ourselves try to deal with it try to be strong
4531526 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game
4531527 i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them

4531529 early on we were playing at a fairly good level they had difficulty returning the serve we knew venezuela was a very physical team we knew they played with a certain emotion
4531530 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4531531 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4531532 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4531533 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4531534 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4531535 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4531536 now people are realizing that the problems arent limited to the u s in some places they might even be worse
4531537 the usds upward momentum is developing freight train like qualities shredding those who attempt to fade the move but rewarding those on board
4531538 primarily the notion that the rest of the world is finally following the u s down the tubes
4531539 we have seen the lows of this multiyear cycle but i dont see the dollar going on a long bull run at this point
4531540 the cornerstone of technical analysis is that history repeats itself
4531541 in that case this could be the start of the bull run that leads us up to a strong point at the end of the decade

4531673 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the
4531674 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4531675 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4531676 displays of obscene wealth in the midst of general squalor
4531677 while in buenos aires and montevideo the wealthy have their enclaves and poor areas are mostly out of sight in the periphery in asunci n there are absolutely enormous modern houses all over even in neighborhoods than arent exactly high rent
4531678 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4531679 every year a couple of them start their own companies theyve been raising millions of dollars over the last few years creating more jobs
4531680 so it is also an opportunity to accelerate their careers and to show to some of the students that they can actually create their own jobs by creating their own companies
4531681 the students have to come up with a solution and they are using technology as a way to solve the problems that theyve stated so necessity really is the mother of invention here and the invention is what we are looking at today
4531682 i have images then i make the imaging processing steps to detect mines in these images
4531683 there is a system of sensors and it monitors the engine how it is running and it adjusts our systems to match a specific oil so if you are using sunflower oil well adjust our algorithm to suit sunflower oil if its rape seed oil it will be a different program
4531684 when you are using unrefined plant oil you are going to get incomplete combustion so we are combating all that with our system
4531685 remote sensing networks are difficult and problematic to maintain existing aerial photography with planes is very costly such a device is really inexpensive we can programme this device to take photos in certain points and at certain altitudes
4531686 we can monitor crop health and irrigation you can monitor temperature over various landscapes we can get information about greenhouse gases
4531687 it is a tree management system but it is different from a regular tree management system because we are using our special sensors which will detect a signal from a tree
4531688 we use these sensors to detect a level of electric current that is running inside the trunk of a tree then we analyse it and model it into information we can use
4531689 one of the main things that trees in a city do is convert carbon dioxide into oxygen they also work as a heat sink they absorb an enormous amount of heat and what happens if we do not have trees is that we have to use a lot of energy to air condition our cities
4531690 our whole industry lives off the fact that we can put more and more on smaller and smaller space make it cheaper and also very important less power consuming in the future

4531702 im thinking of something that is necessary for human life it appears in just about every house youve ever visited and decreases in amount gradually the longer it is around what am i thinking of
4531703 they cant tighten credit now because of where banks are getting their funding
4531704 the american worker does not have a whole lot of bargaining power right now
4531705 were looking at the impoverishment of the american wage earner
4531706 it looks both worse and more broad based than the crunch in the early 1990s
4531707 you are seeing a second round now where credit tightening is showing up strongly in consumer and business loans
4531708 loan underwriting and account management criteria have been tightened with a particular focus on msas with the most significant housing price declines
4531709 using a lot of innovative ways to get the property out the door
4531710 the industry would like to see support for more ginnie mae staff
4531711 they need to have an ability to respond to what is an unprecedented demand for their products
4531712 we dont know how much higher this volume spike is going to get
4531713 they need to have the staff to send teams on site
4531714 i dont think voluntary is the appropriate word when customers were clamoring for this
4531715 alleged misrepresentations made by wachovia to thousands of its customers about the liquidity risk
4531716 we continue to work with state regulators and others to bring real relief to investors who were not given the forthright information they needed in the process of purchasing auction rate securities
4531717 this agreement in principle with wachovia if approved by the commission will permit tens of thousands of wachovia investors to get their money back
4531718 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities
4531719 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4531720 todays settlement is a major step towards making these investors whole
4531721 i am pleased that six months of uncertainty and worry is over and that these investors will soon get their money back
4531722 the industry is taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and thats a good thing
4531723 increase the interest paid on the bonds to attract buyers to the market a recommendation which jeopardised the financial well being
4531724 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4531725 our investigations are ongoing and include both potential corporate and individual violations of the federal securities laws in the event that any such violations are established the terms of todays thursdays settlements would be taken into account
4531726 i want to get out of arcs auction rate certificates
4531727 we categorically reject any claim that the firm engaged in any widespread campaign to move auction rate securities inventory from our own books into private client accounts
4531728 we were disappointed the new york attorney general released details on certain transactions when we conducted our own internal investigation with the assistance of external counsel we found no evidence of unlawful conduct by any employees
4531729 our most important focus continues to be on helping our clients
4531730 continuing to address the needs of the few remaining customers
4531731 the firm has been working with clients to address their liquidity needs
4531732 we are cooperating fully with all regulators and it would be inappropriate to say anything further at this time
4531733 thats disappointing to me my expectation is for the goldman sachs brand
4531734 my expectation for that is they would honor their position and statement of these securities as cash and cash equivalents
4531735 regardless of the settlements the reality is the investment banks owe equal fiduciary obligations to both retail and institutional investors
4531736 the image of firms being dragged to the table is destabilizing
4531737 very few issues have shaken public confidence in the integrity of our markets as much as this
4531738 they feel like they have enough capital but nobody really knows
4531739 are a relatively unknown portion of the mortgage market but could be another wrinkle for mortgage lending
4531740 so thats today what happens a year from now that is the concern out there that these companies will face more problems ahead
4531741 we have an interest in trying to cure as many of these loans as possible the more loans that are cured means well have to pay fewer claims
4531742 that to a great extent is where i would say their higher risk exposures came from
4531743 the current weakened financial condition of many of our mortgage insurance counterparties creates an increased risk that our mortgage insurer counterparties will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims
4531744 all you have to do is say they are no longer eligible to do fannie freddie business and they are out of business
4531745 theres got to be at least 25 000 hidden in your house we can help you find it
4531746 calling it a second mortgage thats like hocking your house
4531747 but call it equity access and it sounds more innocent
4531748 its very difficult for one advertiser to come to you and change your perspective
4531749 but as it becomes socially acceptable for everyone to accumulate debt everyone does
4531750 youve put a lot of work into your home isnt it time for your home to return the favor
4531751 merrill have to be able to say that the uk subsidiary was the owner of those securities it does not matter where the derivatives unit is based or where the trades were executed the only thing that matters is who was the owner of the securities
4531752 theyre permitted to carry that forward to set against profits of the same trade
4531753 it will be a number of years before wall street starts paying taxes again
4531754 with this kind of a tax loss to work with merrill might decide it makes sense to shift business to the uk from other parts of the world
4531755 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4531756 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4531757 after months of rising repossessions tumbling house prices and the fear of negative equity this is further depressing news for homeowners many of whom must be thinking am i next
4531758 we would urge people who are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage payments to seek advice early dont ignore warning letters from your lender as this only makes matters worse
4531759 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4531760 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used
4531761 in the private sector greater financial discipline at individual institutions must be reinforced by a renewed commitment to collective discipline there are circumstances in which individual institutions must be prepared to put aside specific interests in the name of the common interest
4531762 i dont think a lot of the criticism is fair but the sec has not done as good a job in describing its role and what it was doing immediately prior to the collapse of bear stearns
4531763 the sec has not had a champion with the treasury and the chairman has chosen not to make his case for the agency loudly mr cox is a team player and doesnt want to be seen as at odds with the treasury but the people thinking up policy are naturally favourable to the fed
4531764 there is growing bifurcation between investor and consumer protection on the one hand and the safety and stability of markets on the other and we are at a watershed
4531765 the debate now is about whether the market stability function will go with the fed or with a new executive arm
4531766 one place it is not going to go is the sec frankly there has never been evidence that the sec has the tools or the culture to deal with market stability issues it has an enforcement culture with strengths in fraud company filings and disclosure rules
4531767 as the credit crunch has unfolded the sec has looked superfluous partly that is because of its remit but partly it is because of the natural hesitancy and reticence of christopher cox and his senior advisers about what is the proper role of governments in markets they believe in letting institutions shake out hank paulson us treasury secretary and mr bernanke have proven themselves survivalists who have been able to overcome their predilection towards market forces
4531768 there are two factors here a correction from the strong first quarter and an underlying slowdown
4531769 the first half picture is of moderate growth and it is going to remain weak in the euro zone for the remainder of the year
4531770 what is shocking is the speed of the collapse in germany
4531771 i think there has been a lot of hubris at the ecb they took a derisory attitude towards the us saying the federal reserve was too aggressive in cutting rates now they are reaping the bitter reward of their policy
4531772 the confidence expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature
4531773 they boxed themselves in and it became hard to retreat it is clear from the august bulletin that they have now really woken up to the downturn
4531774 recessions in europe are very nasty events they tend to be a lot deeper and more protracted than in the us which is better able to cope with the ups and downs of the business cycle
4531775 the bursting of the emu credit bubble seems imminent and will reveal current account imbalances among euro area countries as extremely dangerous the medium term feasibility of the euro area in its current form must be open to very considerable doubt
4531776 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages
4531777 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
4531778 the volatile financial markets will last for a while and the global economic slowdown is not likely to be short term i see the slowdown will last until 2009
4531779 the domestic consumption which was a major pillar of the growth last year will no longer help as much in sustaining growth
4531780 the positions of non commercial traders in general and hedge funds in particular often move in the same direction as prices
4531781 highlights that we need to ensure that we have our data sets not only complete but exhaustively understood it also shows again we dont have all the information that we need to make declarative statements about the role of speculators in commodity markets im disappointed that the agency released interim study results about the impact of speculators on oil markets when we dont have all the data
4531782 an opportunity for the activity of less informed purely financial investors to distort expectations
4531783 more than 212 000 metric tons 235 000 tons of food is lost to hypoxia in the gulf of mexico
4531784 thats enough to feed 75 percent of the average brown shrimp harvest from the louisiana gulf if there was no hypoxia and there was that much more food dont you think the shrimp and crabs would be happier they would certainly be fatter
4531785 the primary culprit in marine environments is nitrogen and nowadays the biggest contributor of nitrogen to marine systems is agriculture its the same scenario all over the world
4531786 farmers are not doing it on purpose theyd prefer to have it stick on the land
4531787 nitrogen is very slippery its very difficult to keep it on land
4531788 we need to find a technology to keep nitrogen from leaving the soil
4531789 its possible for nue crops to produce the same yield with half as much fertilizer
4531790 its a big economic benefit for farmers if they use only half as much nitrogen as well a big beneficial impact on nitrogen runoff into waterways
4531791 a reasonable expectation is that there would be a dramatic reduction maybe by 2018
4531792 if you look at agricultural ponds you can aerate them to prevent low oxygen
4531793 but thats a pond were talking about open systems with tides the water doesnt just stay there
4531794 if you cant mix a dead zone with the energy of a hurricane
4531795 i dont see how geoengineering is going to do it
4531796 its more like a family everybody knows everybody they help each other june dawson is the best ss teacher in the world

4531800 oh it just makes me hard and i cant seem to get enough
4531801 well i think an hour and a half deep tissue massage will quench our thirsts
4531802 damit wird das ffentlich rechtliche online angebot zum fast food rundfunk degradiert dessen inhalte seiner nachhaltigkeit beraubt werden
4531803 da haben wir in deutschland eine andere tradition wir sind f r ffentliches fernsehen und zwar f r alle zielgruppen und auf allen verbreitungswegen
4531804 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4531805 its not always just about bombs going off there were no bombs in kenya 2003 but we had information that al qaeda terrorist cells were operating there and it was unsafe to tour
4531806 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4531807 this has come out of a little bit of communication with the media about how animals fare in this current climate and recession
4531808 for a lot of people it is becoming harder and harder for them to manage their animals one thing we can do is drop around dog or cat food
4531809 it also gives the older people a visitor once a week which is a good thing
4531810 theyre to keep us safe so we dont get burnt
4531811 around the middle of the day the light has increased over the last two weeks and it looks a bit like a dull day in christchurch
4531812 i dont think there is a lot of worse news that could happen
4531813 if interest rates fall and the housing market picks up that would be positive once we get through an election get some stability that could be positive they all could be positive but they all might not
4531814 you might go to the supermarket and say to somebody what sort of potatoes are these and theyll say dirty ones out of the garden whereas id like to think that we might give you a more sincere and satisfactory answer
4531815 im not saying we go home and watch dvds about vegetables all night but weve got a little bit more of a speciality than a supermarket
4531816 the problem for retailers is such a high proportion of our costs are fixed you still have to pay your rent and youve still got to have people to open doors at the store
4531817 i wouldnt want to comment on any of our activity on that
4531818 were still reviewing the options available and will make a decision in due course
4531819 liquorland is a successful asset for db breweries so while we are looking at the option to sell we will only consider this if a suitable buyer is identified
4531820 he threw open the hut door and he had two people who had walked in to be with our party
4531821 he greeted them and said good to see you and came back out and just collapsed and thats how sudden it was
4531822 you go from a happy afternoons skiing to someone just not being with you
4531823 hed had a bit of a bug apparently last week
4531824 but the two thumb range was the place he really loved
4531825 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion
4531826 we just threw everything we could at trying to help trying to get support in but unfortunately in weather like that you cant get a helicopter in the snow actually just got worse and worse
4531827 he has seen many of his friends go in horrific accidents but he was a stalwart
4531828 he stood for very high standards on the mountain you always felt very very safe with gottlieb
4531829 he had considerable climbing achievements and hes worked hard for conservation too especially natural quiet and managing helicopter areas and so forth
4531830 hes not anti heli skiing its just a question of managing it in the right areas
4531831 he was prepared to take a stand and he was rock solid in his beliefs
4531832 its very sad to hear our hearts go out to the family
4531833 im sure people are getting excited around the notion of it but its not exercising peoples minds here inside the new zealand camp
4531834 its one of the few times weve had potentially so many medal contenders in finals on the same day thats an extraordinary effort for any country
4531835 a desconcentra o as circunst ncias do momento e as actividades marginais modalidade
4531836 os atletas n o estiveram mal mas as expectativas foram colocadas muito alto estou desiludido e triste porque quer o jo o neto quer a telma monteiro poderiam ter ido mais longe
4531837 a desconcentra o as circunst ncias do momento e as actividades marginais modalidade
4531838 achei muito estranho que os atletas pudessem estar dois tr s meses antes dos jogos ol mpicos envolvidos em jantares recep es e campanhas publicit rias tudo isto desgasta e tira muitas horas de trabalho prepara o
4531839 n o houve erros grosseiros que tenham prejudicado os atletas
4531840 entre o 2 e o 9 lugares h uma diferen a m nima tanto ele como a telma monteiro 9 em 52 kg poderiam ter estado na final mas infelizmente tal n o aconteceu s espero que estejam em melhor plano nos pr ximos jogos ol mpicos
4531841 theres been quite substantial snowfall in the last 36 hours
4531842 avalanche conditions have deteriorated in the duration of their trip thats not uncommon
4531843 the snow is known to be very unstable and the boom of the blades is enough to set an avalanche off
4531844 they will be going down to get a closer detail on what efforts are being made and whats going on without interfering with the rescue effort obviously
4531845 its going to be cold but if youve gone and prepared for more than one day then theres every chance of doing well in these situations
4531846 its having the confidence to sometimes do nothing just build a cave and get in it and wait rather than stumbling around out in the storm
4531847 rory stern powerfully combines a deep sense of compassion for his clients with a dead on focus about resolving their most troubling issues
4531848 i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate your emails
4531849 i thoroughly enjoyed your teleclass last night i have to say that this was one of the best if not the best i have participated in i do workshops on parenting kids with adhd and you provided me with some very good information to include in my workshops and my coaching in addition the passion you have for children was very evident thank you for your time and your enthusiasm
4531850 7 dirty little secrets you need to know about adhd amp your child
4531851 walking down a beijing street returning to her hotel when she fell through an open manhole and hit her head
4531852 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night how could this happen
4531853 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4531854 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon

4531863 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4531864 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4531865 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4531866 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4531867 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
4531868 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4531869 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4531870 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4531871 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4531872 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4531873 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4531874 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4531875 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4531876 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4531877 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
4531878 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4531879 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4531880 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
4531881 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 per cent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4531882 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4531883 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4531884 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4531885 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4531886 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4531887 he wont play tomorrow and his next target is our first home game with bolton wanderers next weekend
4531888 its a tough target but one we are hoping he will get to
4531889 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good
4531890 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality

4531922 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4531923 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history

4531925 i call on the government of zimbabwe to fully respect humanitarian principles and the impartiality and neutrality of voluntary and non governmental organisations allowing them to operate freely and with unrestricted access to those in need
4531926 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4531927 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4531928 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4531929 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4531930 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4531932 this is just another fringe group trying to get special treatment for one of the vagaries of genetics i didnt hear the noassattol groups complaining when the greeks refused to enslave men who lacked glorious sinewy orbs atop their legs
4531933 i was a size two in high school but my lack of a booty made it impossible to attract a mate i knew i was going to have to pack on at least 200 pounds and learn to fry some mean slick dumplings if i was going to avoid being a spinster i just wish i had known that there were people out there fighting misconceptions about noassattol maybe then i wouldnt be cleaning my crevices with a washcloth tied to the end of a broom handle

4531965 the families are getting over the shock they are still in shock
4531966 the community church and leaders will decide how best to approach this
4531967 we are not really in a position to say anything we are not mentally in the state to talk to you right now
4531968 may now make it possible for us to be more compassionate and less judgmental about the winners and losers of the cold war and more conscious of the twisted lives left in its wake
4531969 this guy is treating our legal system like a revolving door and its time we closed the cell door on him
4531970 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4531971 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4531972 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4531973 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4531974 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4531975 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired

4531982 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
4531983 i think this is a riskier environment to run a business

4531987 the massive wildfires raging in california this summer are symptomatic of a trend toward more fires burning larger areas in the western united states over the past few decades
4531988 because it is feeding longer fire seasons drier conditions and more lightning according to recent studies the fire season stretches about 78 days longer and individual fires last about 30 days longer
4531989 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4531990 we must get at the root of the problem and reduce the global warming pollution that fuels more frequent and severe fires

4531999 the job market is in the worst most chaotic state ive ever seen it in fixed income ive been doing this for over 30 years and ive never seen anything like this
4532000 following the global credit crunch that started a year ago
4532001 7 1 of the 2007 peak will be cut by june 2009
4532002 i want to teach kids to cook the goal is to have this be my full time job and make enough to live to that end she founded cupcake kids in new york to provide birthday parties and cooking classes for children

4532006 we are making a great game that harry potter fans will really enjoy we are evaluating the impact of the movie date change
4532007 i dont think we were going to leave china if anyone dqd us
4532008 so i think thats about the gist of what they told us
4532009 unfortunately yeah i mean it is something thats hard to forget
4532010 which i guess is a good thing at the same time after this week all that phelps has done you dont want to be the guy who stood in his way
4532011 in my head dont go past 15 meters dont go past 15 meters im sure the guys taking off the blocks dont false start dont false start especially a historic event on the line with this relay this relay might be what it all comes down for eight gold you dont want to be the one that screwed that up
4532012 i feel good i had a little upset stomach all morning

4532020 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4532021 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4532022 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4532023 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4532024 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4532025 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4532026 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4532027 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4532028 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4532029 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4532030 see this plant my daddy says its poison ivy were trying to kill all of it
4532031 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4532032 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4532033 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

4532045 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4532046 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4532047 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4532050 theres not enough information to know why birds sing when they do how noise affects birdsong thats why were doing the study
4532051 i heard them but this summer was my first time recording so i didnt know if the birds had just started singing at night or if i was just so tuned into bird song that i was hearing it for the first time
4532052 if the birds are singing in your neighborhood at night and they werent singing last summer its probably because a tom cat thats a really good birder moved into the neighborhood throw a cat up a tree and those birds will sing all night
4532053 be talking up geovany soto as the mvp think about it
4532054 take his position take what our pitchers have done take his production
4532055 a well above average catcher for me would be mauer
4532056 an average catcher would have to have the mental acumen to take charge of your staff and display a caring that can be felt by all the pitchers next he has to have the receiving ability and stamina to play at least five games a week throwing i would like to have at least average arm strength with a quick release and accuracy he has to block balls well and is fearless on plays at the plate he should be the best worker on the team and hitting i would settle for 250 hitter with around 10 home runs or better
4532057 hey we won the series the pitchers were great and today we had a shutout
4532058 catcher is the only position where we ask young players to develop in two different jobs they have to do catching drills sit in on pitchers meetings learn scouting reports and dont get the hitting reps that other position players get theres a lot to learn
4532059 it took me a lot of work in the minors but i learned that my job is to get the best out of the pitcher to work for and with him
4532060 i know we win with pitching and what i contribute offensively is secondary hey its all about winning not stats

4532096 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely

4532104 if fuel prices stay high this winter it will have a devastating impact on seniors low income families and rural residents
4532105 last winter i had many people coming into my office who were spending 600 to 900 a month trying to get their oil tanks filled these people simply dont have the resources to make the transition to more sustainable fuels if fuel prices remain high this winter people on fixed incomes will have to make the choice of whether to heat or eat
4532106 fuel poverty has been defined as families spending more than 10 of its income on fuel

4532120 with new cuts to culture and arts funding the conservative government is showing once again its complete disrespect toward our countrys cultural institutions and a flagrant lack of vision that is hurting our arts community and culture
4532121 the conservatives are now showing clearly what they have in mind for canadas arts and culture
4532122 the lack of explanation for the cuts and the silence of the heritage minister is unacceptable this governments consistent refusal to consider culture as an important part of canadas development is mind boggling
4532123 just this week without explanation or warning the conservatives cancelled five programs aimed at supporting our artists and creators in the fields of cinema video new media and music these new cancellations bring the total cuts to canadas culture to 23 million in the last two weeks
4532124 as if the governments cuts were not bad enough already they also raise questions about which programs will be cancelled next
4532125 the conservatives still have yet to indicate if they intend to continue funding the canadian television fund and the canada new media fund artists in a democracy should not have to live in fear of being the victim of a right wing governments arbitrary decisions
4532126 we are now witnessing the true colour of this conservative government
4532127 they had already started their demolition work just a few months after taking power but they have now decided that they were cancelling cultural programs one by one with the ministers silent consent in fact if we dont act right now there wont be any programs left to cancel

4532129 if i may be so bold there was another president
4532130 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable

4532182 we have identified nevada as our preferred site for a potential corn production facility due to its proximity to established growing areas highly productive cropland access to the interstate highway and strong population base to recruit future employees
4532183 prior to this initial selection we reviewed 45 other potential locations across iowa illinois and indiana and found that nevada offered the right combination of attributes to meet our business needs
4532184 it will be an expansion of our existing facilities not a replacement
4532185 syngenta is already a valued employer in our area we look forward to the possibility of a significant increase in its presence here
4532186 the facility would be a great fit for our community and all of story county in the past few years nevada has attracted an ethanol plant a bio energy research center and a number of manufacturing companies the syngenta facility would assist in further diversification of our business base

4532189 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4532190 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4532191 we knew what they were using it for and we dont want that type of environment hanging around here
4532192 because theyre using it for illegal activities i cant sell my cigar
4532193 what you choose to do with it is your thing some things you cant control
4532194 if people know you dont carry it they wont come in here for it
4532195 we dont make much money off of it but it pulls in a lot of customers

4532207 i got chris a bmx in a jumble sale in edinburgh for 5 and within two weeks hed broken it doing wheelies

4532214 despite strong opposition from its own shareholders and other constituencies and the severe antitrust regulatory and financing challenges associated with its unsolicited proposal to acquire republic waste management is pushing ahead with its attempt to disrupt our two companies strategic plans with another offer that pales in comparison to the significant value that will be generated through the combination of republic and allied

4532235 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4532236 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4532237 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4532238 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4532239 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4532240 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4532241 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4532242 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4532243 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4532255 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
4532256 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
4532257 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
4532258 i mean they made it seem like any coloradan could go and now you have to work for your ticket
4532259 my experience matches what you are hearing from other sources because of my work schedule and other activities going on i did not sign up for the all star tickets but i was called by the campaign and told that i had to volunteer this week in order to get tickets at all i finally agreed to one three hour shift but it left a bad impression for this lifelong democrat i hope someone in the campaign understands that they are turning off volunteers with their aggressive and disorganized approach
4532260 i just read your article about the confusion regarding tickets to obamas speech and the situation is worse than you reported
4532261 the problem got worse today when i got three phone calls from three different people at the obama campaign office asking me to bring food for the staff i had signed up to donate snacks but i didnt realize i was supposed to feed the whole staff just thought youd want to know that the problem goes way beyond just the confusion about the tickets i have no idea how obama can win colorado when the campaign office is such a disaster
4532262 non vi ho mai chiesto di contribuire a una campagna politica prima di oggi ma il momento e queste elezioni sono troppo importanti per non agire
4532263 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
4532264 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
4532265 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
4532266 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see
4532267 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532268 for the last twelve hours inhuman and indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the georgian territory continued the scale of devastating destruction and loss of innocent lives has yet to be assessed russian ground troops armed invasion transformed already in a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population
4532269 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was
4532270 definitely there has to be a very clear timeline timeline ok
4532271 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4532272 what the bolivian people have expressed today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization
4532273 yeah i actually i was dragged out by the police so you can see like ive been bleeding from like being dragged on the floor and then this is from the security guards this is from the security guards inside when they had this like cardboard that was like slicing my arm open in the beginning we hoped to actually go in and we hoped to hold up a tibetan flag and also this other banner you know in protest of the communist partys one party rule in china
4532274 we ask the united nations and the international society to push north korea pakistan and israel to denuclearize and hold strict measures against irans suspected nuclear weapons
4532275 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you

4532279 at least 43 people were killed and 247 injured 51 critically when two passenger trains collided in china early on monday
4532280 ive seen the go train installations recently while on a break in ontario the install itself is very impressive a neat hardworking unit with no apparent weakness in the design ive never met a canadian thug but im sure they would have problems tackling the thing
4532281 i understand its a commuter environment but the time between the stops doesnt warrant the sheer amount of information on the screen id say the average time between stops is about 9 minutes so lets assume average joe is on the train approx 27 minutes this is ample time to run a decent length loop with information and advertising

4532285 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532286 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
4532287 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4532288 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
4532289 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4532290 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist
4532291 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532292 conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
4532293 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4532294 look hes an expert on iraq go talk to him
4532295 my goodness thats an awful lot in one letter solving so many of the white houses problems all at once
4532296 the second nugget in the book involves a supposed order from the white house to me at the cia to have my staff fabricate a letter connecting iraq with al qaida and the attacks of 9 11
4532297 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
4532298 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
4532299 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
4532300 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
4532301 yes but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
4532302 but he didnt say that specifically i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
4532303 right im with you im with you but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
4532304 im going to trust truth at to the end of this era
4532305 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
4532306 i have this young son hes a guy hes a smart guy hes a little bit wayward and maybe rob as a bit of an older guy maybe you could spend some time with him
4532307 well maybe well throw someone over the side maybe well open up
4532308 no no tim that was just one source who said that
4532309 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge
4532310 you know maybe its time for us to meet with the americans
4532311 can we help at this point you know we get it alright
4532312 we can help with iraq we can help with afghanistan we know these countries
4532313 you know ron you know ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
4532314 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
4532315 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call
4532316 your safety is based on the state of our relationship make no mistake
4532317 if anything happens up here in the next week we know where to find you
4532318 my goodness if we get you its going to be curtains
4532319 usman hold onto your dreams dont let those be troubled or darkened by whats happening now
4532320 im ready to move forward based on what i will say clearly i have learned
4532321 we have no plan we have no plan on this score
4532322 and youre telling me what considering what youve done ultimately youre down in the mud with us now get used to it
4532323 im not going to back off this man is innocent
4532324 you know at days end if were true to our oath we dont really have enemies certainly no enemies that cant be easily defeated if we want to be secure america has to start embracing a kind of authenticity to say were not going to do back door ugly things that end up ruining our status in the world the oaths the values are strong enough if you believe in them the world will bend toward you even on the most specific issue of information that will help us be secure
4532325 well you know i let them think theyre saving me but of course im saving them
4532326 but oddly thats where the problem starts because then i say i saved you and now heres what i want and make it transactional see thats a lie
4532327 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532328 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532329 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
4532330 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia
4532331 told me that he will kill me and chop my body into pieces
4532332 it is a sad day when judges need to remind jailers not to threaten their detainees with death and mutilation

4532346 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532347 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the twenty first century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4532348 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
4532349 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
4532350 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4532351 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4532352 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
4532353 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532354 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
4532355 were better at this than you people we have relationships where you often have none lets try to exercise the known and the knowable here so that we can bring at least some clarity to this debate
4532356 we have recently learned about british intelligence finding niger documents on uranium
4532357 we now know that there may be no wmd in iraq
4532358 well only a few people know about this i dont understand how you know clearly you do do you want me to talk about it confirm it
4532359 look 25 percent of us thought it was denial and deception
4532360 well well look for that one and well get back to you
4532361 hey these are the last days of this administration its over forget it whats the use of continuing the investigation
4532362 id bet my career on it everything was coming from those guys at this point go check this go do this some of it fanciful
4532363 well certainly in terms of specifically disinformation a lie they hadnt done the deception
4532364 but do you know specifically it was from the vice president
4532365 no what i know is it was from the white house
4532366 its ridiculous habbush isnt going to want to sign this thing hes too smart for that you know hes the intelligence chief of iraq hes a guy like us
4532367 were probably just going to have to fabricate it ourselves get someone to write it and then just deliver it
4532368 i wish george had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea
4532369 well actually you know this is not the kind of thing that we would do on our own
4532370 this is a golden opportunity we have a window right into saddams inner circle through the intelligence chief habbush we can put anything through that window we can put misinformation through that window we can turn saddam in various directions we even can send habbush in with a team to take saddam out
4532371 imagine then we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad something that could save many american lives
4532372 my goodness american lives are at stake here youre cutting off the channel because you dont want to know more and we have to now go forward without the advantages and opportunities that habbush might have provided
4532373 we understand this is classified but we have people here who are charged to look at classified information in a kind of lockbox
4532374 well give it to you when were good and ready
4532375 they dont hold water in courts when there is the issue of wrongdoing
4532376 this is my business youre on a need to know basis ill tell you what i believe youre supposed to know
4532377 that is impossible that you would think that is an issue of national security
4532378 oh what can i do well you know where do i engage you know theyre the pros and im just going about my life
4532379 now wait a second i kind of own this government the way this works is im the sovereign the people theyre servants public servants
4532380 i have seen no coverage of rons allegations in the new york times i think such is important to legitimize the issues he raises has ron been contacted by the times why does he think there has been no coverage
4532381 how can i advance the story how can i find essentially my own fresh added corroboration added evidence essentially to what is clearly laid out in the book
4532382 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
4532383 a peaceful and better world is possible through friendly engagement and mutual understanding not violent confrontation and polarization its an olympic message a possible dream that our global civilization and everyone who is a part of it can aspire to and for which i am proud to carry a torch
4532384 die universit t ist noch nicht reif f r eine frau
4532385 painfully aware that the department of defense currently prohibits media coverage of these somber ceremonies which in turn bars the public from those images as well
4532386 as a part of war members of the military must sacrifice their lives for our freedoms
4532387 now as a photo journalist and educator my role is to teach the youth of today the importance of our freedoms i can state unequivocally that my colleagues mean no disrespect to the uniform or the families when we have covered these moving events
4532388 powerful photographs from the vietnam war including those from dover helped shift public opinion about the conflict and more and more americans became opposed to the countrys efforts in southeast asia
4532389 many americans as well as the media have cried foul over the department of defense and the bush administrations ban of coverage of american soldiers bodies arriving back home and have grown weary of the censorship and the effort to control public opinion based on whats seen or in this case not seen in the news
4532390 in 2004 a photograph showing around 20 flag draped coffins of soldiers killed in iraq being loaded onto an air force plane in kuwait for the flight home to dover was taken by an american civil contractor and sent to the seattle times violating company and government bans on such pictures
4532391 when it ran on the times front page it was met with equal amounts of outrage and praise but it was the first time a photograph of americas soldiers killed in iraq was published by the media in the states the contractor lost her job because of the photograph
4532392 remind the american people through a photograph that we are at war i never understood the policy prohibiting them i dont know why i didnt challenge it before
4532393 when that coffin is taken off the plane you dont know the name you know it is an american who lost his life for his country
4532394 they hold 30 percent of the nations coal reserves and have an abundant supply of oil and natural gas but also face a growing climate change movement determined to stop development of fossil fuels and spur renewable energy
4532395 with an upswing in energy prices tribes are looking at their resources more and hearing from industry wanting to work on reservation land
4532396 theres a rift between some tribal leaders who see hope in oil gas and coal and people who think energy companies are taking advantage of people who are eager for money
4532397 we made a decision to pursue this type of clean coal project because it provides long term economic and social benefits for our people for many generations to come
4532398 my mistake i thought she meant her friends and family
4532399 se voi lascerete mettere sistemi di difesa antimissilistici u s a nelle vostre nazioni noi spezzare voi

4532402 we have come a long way from the gods and from the angels the breaches of this worldly reality which these mighty figures embodied have increasingly vanished from our consciousness as serious possibilities
4532403 so that the rumor of god may not disappear completely

4532407 seriously it amazes me how much time some people spend trying to prove someone elses religion wrong why not put your time and energy into preaching what you know to be true and right not what is soooo wrong about what other people believe you need to get real 8 minutes ago source s i am not jw but i am tired of these kinds of questions

4532412 stop being so pc and tell it like it is body mass is not a handicap it is a choice fat folks have to deal with the baggage that comes with the choices they make
4532413 requiring anyone to sit next to an obese person is discrimination against the normal person
4532414 passengers who are forced to sit next to a weight challenged fellow flyer should be compensated for the inconvenience if i pay for a seat i want my full seat if the person next to me oozes his or her bulk into the space that i have paid for then i want compensation in proportion to my loss
4532415 make these people stand on the luggage scale maybe a little humiliation will be incentive to start doing something about it
4532416 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4532417 if i have a little money i buy books and if any is left i buy food and clothes
4532418 you see my children with me several times a week you see how well behaved and helpful they are it doesnt require heroism to be with my kids it is my joy to be with my kids

4532432 as the national average for a gallon of gas hovers around 4 i think its high time we stop looking to foreign countries for our energy and start looking at alternative sources of transportation fuel right here at home given our countrys vast coal reserves coal to liquids technology is an extremely promising domestic alternative to petroleum based transportation fuel
4532433 now is the time to more fully develop the science that would enable diesel reliant consumers and the u s military to utilize this clean coal based fuel the center for applied energy research at the university of kentucky has proved time and time again that it is at the forefront of energy research and i am confident uk caer researchers will use these funds well to expedite the commercial availability of this technology and the creation of high paying energy sector jobs throughout kentucky
4532434 the fact that we can no longer rely on unstable foreign regimes to supply the energy resources we need has never been clearer it is time to put all our options on the table and implement a comprehensive energy strategy that will explore our domestic resources develop alternative fuels and invest heavily in future fuel technology coal to liquid technology could have enormous benefits for kentucky as a source of thousands of jobs and for our nation as a source of clean stable affordable fuel the center for applied energy research is working at the tip of the spear on new ways to develop clean and efficient energy i am confident that the university of kentucky and the center will use these funds to develop solutions to our energy crisis
4532435 energy independence is an absolute must if this nation hopes to remain globally competitive
4532436 thanks to congressmen rogers and davis this appropriation will ensure kentucky remains a key player in the energy independence game the funds will provide uks center for applied energy research the additional resources it needs to leverage its innovative advancements in coal to liquid technology thats good news for uk good news for kentuckys energy industry and most importantly good news for kentuckians
4532437 these are the researchers who will lead us to energy independence i am thrilled that we can leverage our scarce state funds for this greater good and i look forward to continued collaboration with the uk center for applied energy research on this and other projects
4532438 of course you think those books are amazing you dont read anything else
4532439 and how this piece of nylon would look wrapped around your neck

4532459 the intensity quality and purity of the work make the recognition of it as a leonardo the obvious conclusion
4532460 the detail in the eye is very limpid as leonardo strongly believed in making the eyes look like the windows of the soul it emphasizes the interior grace and character of the subject
4532461 its very probable that this work was commissioned by the lady in the picture and sent to a prospective groom to show off her beauty
4532462 there were only very few artists of that calibre then
4532463 when i first saw the painting i was struck by two possibilities that it was a very beautiful fake or an unknown leonardo
4532464 what i noted was the skill of the shading around the face which i believe can only have been drawn by a left handed artist such as leonardo
4532465 es un sue o hecho realidad tras la gran temporada que hice con el toulouse fontaines en la cfa 2 me hubiera encantado fichar por un equipo de tercera divisi n pero nunca pens que podr a llegar a la ligue 1 pero ahora estoy aqu y quiero ver lo que puedo conseguir
4532466 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4532467 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4532468 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4532469 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4532470 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this
4532471 well it seems we have a small problem on your part
4532472 my name is frosty j and my wifejo and i just leave over yonder
4532473 just frosty would be fine you can drop the j and i am here to inform you that i hit your goat
4532474 actually i hit your goat real hard and knock him off the road i know youre new in these parts but i think that the next goat you get you should probably keep him tied up even though i know goats dont stay tied up very well i could possibly help build you a pen but i felt it the neighbor thing to do was tell you that goats do not belong in the road
4532475 frosty thank you for coming to tell me this about the goat and all however i am sad to say or maybe not sad to say but i dont own a goat i dont own any animals yet
4532476 well ok then it looks like you dont have as big as problem as i thought you did can you come for dinner than jo makes a mean beef stew and an even better homemade apple pie
4532477 i look at it as a community fair that just happens to have an aviation theme
4532478 unless you have a child under 18 living in the home
4532479 if you were active duty and had a family emergency we could have helped
4532480 well you would have to find your own way out
4532481 our whole industry lives off the fact that we can put more and more on smaller and smaller space make it cheaper and also very important less power consuming in the future
4532482 every year a couple of them start their own companies theyve been raising millions of dollars over the last few years creating more jobs
4532483 so it is also an opportunity to accelerate their careers and to show to some of the students that they can actually create their own jobs by creating their own companies
4532484 the students have to come up with a solution and they are using technology as a way to solve the problems that theyve stated so necessity really is the mother of invention here and the invention is what we are looking at today
4532485 i have images then i make the imaging processing steps to detect mines in these images
4532486 there is a system of sensors and it monitors the engine how it is running and it adjusts our systems to match a specific oil so if you are using sunflower oil well adjust our algorithm to suit sunflower oil if its rape seed oil it will be a different program
4532487 when you are using unrefined plant oil you are going to get incomplete combustion so we are combating all that with our system
4532488 remote sensing networks are difficult and problematic to maintain existing aerial photography with planes is very costly such a device is really inexpensive we can programme this device to take photos in certain points and at certain altitudes
4532489 we can monitor crop health and irrigation you can monitor temperature over various landscapes we can get information about greenhouse gases
4532490 it is a tree management system but it is different from a regular tree management system because we are using our special sensors which will detect a signal from a tree
4532491 we use these sensors to detect a level of electric current that is running inside the trunk of a tree then we analyse it and model it into information we can use
4532492 one of the main things that trees in a city do is convert carbon dioxide into oxygen they also work as a heat sink they absorb an enormous amount of heat and what happens if we do not have trees is that we have to use a lot of energy to air condition our cities
4532493 i have to say that i found some of russias actions disproportionate
4532494 the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia
4532495 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4532496 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4532497 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4532498 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone

4532501 russland wurde provoziert und erkl rte daraufhin georgien den krieg dabei nutzte russland die gelegenheit um der welt zu zeigen dass die zeiten der dem tigung vorbei sind und dass russland es sich nicht gefallen lassen wird dass die nato sich in seine einflusszone einmischt eines scheint mir logisch zu sein wer die unabh ngigkeit des kosovos unterst tzt hat kein recht dies anderen regionen wie s dossetien zu verweigern es handelt sich jedoch nicht nur um rechte sondern auch um macht russland hat seine macht zur ck erobert und wird sie l ndern wie der ukraine georgien und eines tages vielleicht auch den baltischen staaten aufzwingen und sie von europa und amerika trennen falls n tig mit gewalt wladimir putin sagte einmal das ende der udssr war das schlimmste was der welt im 20 jahrhundert passiert ist ich sagte damals dass er sich nur im jahrhundert geirrt hatte die wahren konsequenzen der sowjetischen implosion werden wir erst jetzt erleben nach den amerikanischen fehlern der letzten jahre wird sich der n chste us pr sident entscheiden m ssen entweder er zieht zur ck und setzt viele stliche l nder russlands einfluss aus oder er macht es nicht und wir werden einen krieg zwischen den usa und russland erleben der kosovo und georgien sind die ersten episoden eines films der ungl cklich enden kann
4532502 nat rlich hat niemand jemals behauptet dass die eu alleine einschreiten soll um kriegshandlungen zu beenden aber unsere mangelnde f higkeit aus sch nen worten ernst zu machen hat dazu beigetragen regionalen gro m chten in den regionen in denen sie eigene interessen verfolgen freies spiel zu lassen das gilt nicht zuletzt f r russland im kaukasus die t rkei in kurdistan israel in pal stina und den sudan in darfur die eu hat eine gro e verantwortung f r die konflikte in kurdistan pal stina und darfur aber so lange wir noch nicht einmal russland an unserer eigenen grenze im zaum halten k nnen ist es schwer optimistisch zu bleiben wenn das 21 jahrhundert etwas anderes als ein jahrhundert der illusionen sein soll m ssen die eu l nder eine neue aktive au enpolitik entwickeln die russland und anderen aggressoren widerstand leisten kann

4532506 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists

4532686 this discovery gives us a real sense of place a wonderful slice of continuity across the centuries as archaeologists its a thrill to be able to discover the identity of a place but also to think of the plays and stories to be retold on this site for years to come

4532707 we made a decision to pursue this type of clean coal project because it provides long term economic and social benefits for our people for many generations to come
4532708 capturing co2 and injecting it into a well to squeeze more oil out of the ground is
4532709 theres a rift between some tribal leaders who see hope in oil gas and coal and people who think energy companies are taking advantage of people who are eager for money
4532710 the cheyenne people are living on one of the poorest reservations in the country and yet for over 30 years they have refused to stripmine their homeland for promises of riches
4532711 renewable energy could do more financially for the tribes than gaming
4532712 we see this public transportation initiative as something we need to do
4532713 it would be good to overcome what some companies see as a problem
4532714 we try to tailor our routes to be employment related but that cant always be done
4532715 we want to make it easier and more feasible for people to get to where they need to go
4532716 it really is a demographic divide in whats happening with the white population in this country and whats happening with minorities and its mostly due to immigration
4532717 itll feed into the immigration debate first of all and probably the election
4532718 congress has been kind of slow to make decisions about immigration but these numbers i think will probably put this back on a lot of peoples minds
4532719 this accelerates everything it accelerates the diversity of the younger ages the middle ages and even the senior ages
4532720 we need to spend much more time dealing with the issue of diversity in the united states
4532721 right now we have diverse parts of our country and its spreading out you see its causing a lot of social confrontations in some places i think part of that is weve not yet anticipated these demographic shifts
4532722 its immigrants coming in but its the fact they tend to be younger theyre starting families and theyre creating population momentum
4532723 this is the equivalent of the entire population of great britain and france together its as if those two countries entirely moved to the united states
4532724 it means like 80 million more cars on the road
4532725 the point here is what does it mean for the quality of life the quality of the environment profound questions
4532726 its not the weather this isnt happening because americans are choosing to have large families its happened primarily not entirely but largely because of a federal program immigration that is the toleration of illegal immigration and very generous legal immigration
4532727 i think it would be damn fine if you took over the website
4532728 hey if you get all fucked up in the head give me a call

4532733 i thought that we were one of the brands they would want to keep and nurture
4532734 i felt like it was an old friend put out to pasture
4532735 martha was going to show us how to do all these things with food and entertaining and then we had sigrid there helping to dress us
4532736 speaking as a baby boomer fashion is far more individual today
4532737 that customer may find particular things that work in different lines instead of saying blanket wide this is the label for me
4532738 it was her art speaking to you through her clothing
4532739 i would put on tops of hers and felt like i was wearing a piece of art
4532740 we began to lose that personal touch but what i gained was a different perspective and playing with the big boys was something i enjoyed learning
4532741 when juicy came along it was like the cute baby that takes everyones attention
4532742 it was amazing ive never seen anything tank so quickly in my whole life
4532743 i never felt like i was in danger of losing my life
4532744 i just knew that i had to go through this experience ultimately it made me want to make sure that the years i have left im doing what makes me happy and that i dont have to spend a lot of time doing what other people tell me to do
4532745 my husband said pay them a licensing fee im not paying them a licensing fee who knows they may just drop it if they cant do anything with it
4532746 sigrid olsen is an iconic brand that developed a remarkably strong consumer connection

4532752 i got a call today friday at 8 in the morning and they told me my grandmother had died it totally threw me off my feet it was a very difficult day for me my heart was anywhere but on the track
4532753 i was on the track before running and i really wanted to run but to run out of the stadium
4532754 i have cried all day i was not in a mood for competing i grew up with my grandmother lilian she was 72
4532755 i did well to compete at least i lost my title in there
4532756 it feels like we have an opportunity in the summer
4532757 we would never do anything to hurt one of the movies or the series
4532758 i read the we love our fans and was like wow what a lie
4532759 then i started to cry as we knelt on the kitchen floor i said mommy imma love you till you dont hurt no more and when im older you aint gotta work no more and imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
4532760 were going to have to see but i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games the proof will be in the pudding but hopefully i will be fine
4532761 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully touch wood i will be able to do that
4532762 its been tough the toughest part of my career so far definitely
4532763 obviously there are rumours and everything there were times that it did get on top of me you have your friends and family and you need those people around you to keep you going
4532764 the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt fit at the time
4532765 then he doesnt really know the history of everything that comes with it i admit it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4532766 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4532767 he had a serious injury which means we have to treat him differently to the rest of the squad and take it game by game to see how his knee responds
4532768 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4532769 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us
4532770 weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it
4532771 there are 38 games and every one is tough you have to be willing to grind out results when youre not playing so well and get results away from home
4532772 weve not been doing that and well have to do that if we want to break in the top four

4532776 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4532777 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice

4532816 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4532817 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4532818 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4532819 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4532829 from what she eats for breakfast to the way she cleans her home todays woman lives in a state of near constant empowerment
4532830 as recently as 15 years ago a woman could only feel empowered by advancing in a male dominated work world asserting her own sexual wants and needs or pushing for a stronger voice in politics today a woman can empower herself through actions as seemingly inconsequential as driving her children to soccer practice or watching the oxygen network
4532831 shopping for shoes has emerged as a powerful means by which women assert their autonomy

4532906 el cuadro del mundo que se le presenta a la gente queda enterrada bajo monta as de mentiras
4532907 una idea alternativa de democracia es la de que no debe permitirse que la gente se haga cargo de sus propios asuntos y los medios de informaci n deben estar fuerte y r gidamente controlados
4532908 una sociedad hist rica y belicista que quer a ir a la guerra y destruir todo lo que oliera a alem n
4532909 fabricar consenso para producir en la poblaci n la aceptaci n de algo inicialmente no deseado
4532910 estamos en una democracia y no en un estado totalitario
4532911 se espera de ellos que se apoltronen y se conviertan en espectadores
4532912 blandiendo una porra sobre las cabezas de los individuos y si se apartan del camino trazado golpe ndoles sin piedad
4532913 pero si la sociedad es democr tica hay que dirigir la atenci n a las t cnicas de propaganda
4532914 la racionalidad es una t cnica una habilidad al alcance de muy pocos mientras que la mayor a de la gente se gu a por las emociones
4532915 es aqu donde las estrategias propagand sticas atacan directas a movilizar al reba o a trav s de las emociones sin permitirles una tregua para que no pongan en marcha el peligroso raciocinio controla la opini n p blica que es
4532916 los individuos tienen que estar atomizados segregados y solos no puede ser que pretendan organizarse porque en ese caso podr an convertirse en algo m s que simples espectadores pasivos
4532917 la capacidad de actuar de los sindicatos como n cleo de organizaci n
4532918 y no por casualidad los empresarios pusieron a prueba una nueva t cnica de destrucci n de las organizaciones obreras
4532919 importantes problemas relativos a la salud la educaci n los que no tienen hogar los parados el ndice de criminalidad la delincuencia creciente que afecta a amplias capas de la poblaci n las c rceles el deterioro de los barrios perif ricos es decir la colecci n completa de problemas conocidos en estas circunstancias hay que ya que si empezara a darse cuenta de lo que ocurre podr a no gustarle porque es quien recibe directamente las consecuencias de lo anterior
4532920 hay que hacer que conserven un miedo permanente porque a menos que est n debidamente atemorizados por todos los posibles males que pueden destruirles desde dentro o desde fuera
4532921 el reba o desconcertado nunca acaba de estar debidamente domesticado es una batalla permanente

4532963 nebuchadnezzar obsessed by satan demolished jerusalem temple and crowds of refugees went to the north

4532976 the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 percent of the lost revenue

4532991 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away

4533125 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
4533126 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
4533127 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
4533128 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
4533129 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
4533130 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
4533131 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
4533132 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
4533133 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
4533134 thats a phenomenal speed and most people wont be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds let alone two hours
4533135 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits
4533136 olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve

4533147 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4533148 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4533149 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4533150 i will be shocked if he isnt a top two pick in the draft
4533151 if he gets a jumper at all he is a lock as a team leader and ticket draw his tenacity toughness and poise at such a young age are remarkable
4533152 he is the guy every gm wants to see this season
4533153 hes an exceptional talent whos doing and playing at a level over and above his age
4533154 i would say that ricky looks more like pistol than he plays like him maybe the biggest thing about him is his ability to change a game on defense just wreak havoc on an opponents offense but he doesnt do it in a conventional way hell let you go by him and run behind you and steal the ball he roams all over the place creating chaos and making things happen out of nowhere
4533155 he has a real flair the skys the limit for him
4533156 rubio is an amazing talent for his age very gifted instinctive player who could be a fantastic player someday
4533157 my concerns are that he may not mature physically much more and his speed is not of the blazing category folks can say what they want about steve nash but nash can run with anyone ill be curious to see how rubio handles nba speed in his near future
4533158 at the worst he will be a rock star in europe i hope he makes it simply because the league needs guys who play like that and kids need guys that play like that to emulate
4533159 is los angeles really so much worse than san francisco

4533246 we surveyed over 9 000 boys in california and oregon and found that vaccinated boys had a 155 greater chance of having a neurological disorder like adhd or autism than unvaccinated boys
4533247 the consistency of prevalence estimates across the two surveys supports high reliability or reproducibility of parental report of autism and reliability is one important component of validity
4533248 there is no evidence that a loosening in the diagnostic criteria has contributed to increased number of autism clients we conclude that some if not all of the observed increase represents a true increase in cases of autism in california a purely genetic basis for autism does not fully explain the increasing autism prevalence other theories that attempt to better explain the observed increase in autism cases include environmental exposures to substances such as mercury viral exposures autoimmune disorders and childhood vaccinations
4533249 for three years the cdc has used a study conducted on its own vaccine safety datalink to reassure parents that mercury in vaccines does not cause autism
4533250 its an open question whether anything about vaccines timing dose preservative is related to the rise in diagnoses of autism some studies are stronger than others the verstraeten pediatrics study was an improvement on other studies including the two in denmark both of which had serious weaknesses in their designs that limit what we can learn from them
4533251 presentations and discussions on strategies for research focusing on the potential relationship between autism and an array of environmental exposures
4533252 unvaccinated children tended to be white to have a mother who was married and had a college degree to live in a household with an annual income exceeding 75 000 and to have parents who expressed concerns regarding the safety of vaccines and indicated that medical doctors have little influence over vaccination decisions for their children
4533253 why do some parents avoid vaccinating their children our results indicate that parents of unvaccinated children are much more concerned about vaccine safety than are parents whose children receive your browser may not support display of this image 1 vaccine dose in a survey of parents beliefs and practices regarding vaccinations and autism siblings in families in which there was an autistic child were 3 times more likely to be unvaccinated compared with siblings in families in which there was a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in response to concerns about the perceived risk of autism resulting from vaccinations parents might have avoided having their sons vaccinated at a higher rate than their daughters as a result of knowing that they have risk factors for autism and knowing that the rate of autism is 4 times greater for boys than for girls
4533254 has the government ever looked at the autism rate in an unvaccinated u s population and if not why not
4533255 in this country we have very high levels of vaccination as you probably know and i think this year we have record immunization levels among all of our children so to select an unvaccinated group that on a population basis would be representative to look at incidence in that population compared to the other population would be something that could be done but as were learning just trying to look at autism in a community the size of atlanta its very very difficult to get an effective numerator and denominator to get a reliable diagnosis i think those kind of studies could be done and should be done youd have to adjust for the strong genetic component that also distinguishes for example people in amish communities who may elect not to be immunized and also have genetic connectivity that would make them different from populations that are in other sectors of the united states so drawing some conclusions from them would be very difficult i think with reference to the timing of all of this good science does take time and its part of one of the messages i feel like ive learned from the feedback that weve gotten from parents groups this summer in struggling with developing a more robust and a faster research agenda is lets speed this up lets look for the early studies that could give us at least some hypotheses to test and evaluate and get information flowing through the research pipeline as quickly as we can so we are committed to doing that and as i mentioned in terms of just measuring the frequency of autism in the population some pretty big steps have been taken were careful not to jump ahead of our data but we think we will be able to provide more accurate information in the next year or so than weve been able to do up to this point and i know that is our responsibility weve also benefited from some increased investments in these areas that have allowed us to do this and so we thank congress and we thank the administration for supporting those investments not just at cdc but also at nih and fda

4533257 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4533258 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4533259 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4533260 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4533261 the law is based on more than just words written law books
4533262 dont tell me about the constitution of the united states
4533263 an act so heinous that it defies ones ability to describe it
4533264 the state carries the power of the sword that is the power to prohibit conduct with physical penalties such as confinement and even execution it must use that power to prevent the subversion of children toward this lifestyle to not encourage a criminal lifestyle
4533265 it appears that justice moore is once again making his decisions on the basis of his personal religious beliefs not the commands of the law justice moore would make a great official of the inquisition but he doesnt belong on a state supreme court i dont know what to expect next from moore perhaps a witch burning
4533266 edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4533267 ordinary citizens can have an enormous influence in what happens in washington the problem is citizens are just not organized right now and so those who are organized the corporations the special interests and the big lobbies have a disproportionate influence part of what this campaign is about is to tilt the scales more in favor of ordinary people
4533268 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4533269 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4533270 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4533271 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4533272 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4533273 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4533274 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4533275 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4533276 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4533277 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4533278 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4533279 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4533280 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4533281 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4533282 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4533283 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4533284 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4533285 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4533286 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4533287 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4533288 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4533289 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4533290 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4533291 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4533292 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4533293 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4533301 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4533302 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4533303 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4533304 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4533305 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4533306 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4533307 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4533308 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4533309 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4533310 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4533311 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4533312 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4533313 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4533314 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4533315 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4533316 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4533317 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4533318 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4533319 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4533320 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4533321 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4533322 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4533323 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4533324 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4533325 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4533326 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4533327 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4533328 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4533329 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice
4533330 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4533331 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute
4533332 lenders must play their part and ensure they look at all the options before rushing to the court and use repossession as the last rather than first option
4533333 he is going to be there he will be meeting with political leaders
4533334 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4533335 swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at gatwick airport swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4533336 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4533337 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4533338 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4533339 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4533340 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4533341 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4533342 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4533343 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4533344 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4533345 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4533346 i think what we need to do is support the families in the demands that they are now making
4533347 i started to believe that i was special and became increasing egocentric
4533348 the biggest narcissist i ever dated was a guy that was in a marginally successful band our entire relationship was focused on doing things around his show schedule shows which i always felt pressured to attend even though frankly i thought they were kind of boring he was really into talking about his craft and had no interest in my boring day job loser
4533349 i went on a few dates with this guy who i swear had this obsession with being featured in gq someday he was pretty successful professionally and in truth the idea of him actually being in gq wasnt totally outrageous but the fact that he wanted it so badly and talked about it was so unattractive
4533350 i dated a guy who make the most annoying and passive aggressive remarks about the outfits i would wear when we would go out to the point where i would often change because i felt like he would be embarrassed to stand next to me if i didnt we did not last long but let me tell you a guy who thinks you look anything other than hot in whatever isnt worth spending time with
4533351 my ex boyfriend would seriously hog the bathroom mirror in the morning before work and when we were getting ready to go out and he would constantly ask me if i liked how he looked or what he was wearing but he always seemed to know the answer so why was he asking
4533352 this is simple if a guy youre dating is always pushing your head down for a little bj action but never offers to reciprocate he clearly is just all about himself
4533353 i made the mistake of dating a writer who i also assigned stories to at my job at a magazine when i switched jobs to a magazine that was outside his area of interest he stopped calling to ask me out i found out later he was dating my replacement such a dog
4533354 when my grandmother who basically raised me died the guy i had been seeing for a few months very quickly went cold when i tried to lean on him for support its like when our relationship stopped being all fun and games and sex he didnt want anything to do with me it was really painful
4533355 my ex boyfriend was so obsessed with comparing himself to the other men he worked with how he made more money than them was better than them at their jobs how he had better taste and more connections
4533356 i wasnt dating him but a guy i assisted at a law firm has the most ridiculous lists of tasks for me i had to have the exact same breakfast waiting for him when he came in at the exact same time every morning i had to run the most ridiculous
4533357 because it surfaces so infrequently no one knew what to expect
4533358 that was a thrilling moment the more burials you do the more you get used to the mechanics of dealing with the remains but there is still a human context to your reaction
4533359 we are looking at the bones of an individual and you can see them as a whole person
4533360 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4533361 im saying theres been this fictionalized life story put out by obama in his autobiography that has been magnified during the campaign and the truth is dramatically different in many instances from what obama represents
4533362 if the fundamental smear of unfit for command was that war hero the insinuation of mr corsis latest is that mr obama is a closet muslim and militant black activist drug user
4533363 several of the books accusations are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
4533364 president bush delivered a brief stern warning to russia this afternoon and told moscow that its attacks in georgia had substantially damaged its standing in the world and its relations with the west
4533365 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
4533366 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
4533367 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
4533368 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
4533369 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
4533370 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
4533371 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
4533372 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
4533373 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
4533374 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
4533375 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
4533376 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
4533377 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
4533378 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
4533379 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
4533380 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
4533381 be the change that you want to see in the world
4533382 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4533383 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4533384 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4533385 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4533386 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4533387 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4533388 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4533389 who are open to doing something on the production side
4533390 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4533391 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4533392 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4533393 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4533394 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4533395 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4533396 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4533397 the response from the audience the critics and the industry has been very positive
4533398 ive had the desire for a long time to do a film on deception
4533399 vallottons etchings show small intimate scenes of life with different characters like a separation an argument often between a man and a woman
4533400 i wanted the film to get as close as possible to the rather cruel and sensual side of these etchings
4533401 panorama of contemporary auteur cinema where young talent rubs shoulders with that of established directors
4533402 i was wondering if the piazza grande would work so well especially comparing the saturday night slot of last year for the bourne ultimatum with this years with philipp stoelzls north face but i didnt need to worry because we had 7 700 people on the square
4533403 five films found sales agents after arriving here in locarno and i heard a lot of buyers being very enthusiastic about this years selection i think we found the right balance open doors was also a huge success with the number of one to one meetings trebling and some projects were not only finding co producers in europe but also in other parts of latin america
4533404 personally i dont give a damn it doesnt matter to me whether the successor is french swiss or not european or not ideally i would like locarno to become the european sundance
4533405 so long as i am president here and thats for a few more years yet locarno will not get an artistic director who is only interested in glamour
4533406 on the condition that they have something to say that is the only criteria one shouldnt idiotically squander locarnos real capital the enormous affection of the public so i am not going to choose someone who wants to stupidly imitate the cannes festival and i am not going to choose someone who only judges according to hard arthouse i am for a middle line i am looking for someone who is open to all forms of cinema who has something to say and is the seismograph of the world but is also someone who gives pleasure and makes one dream
4533407 a purist cinephile and someone who only thinks of sequins and industry
4533408 the festival is getting bigger with more journalists coming politicians visiting and more actors and directors attending which demands a certain knowledge of the festival i had a chance when i started of already having known the machine from the inside
4533409 if the new person is not appointed before the 2009 festival we would have the press then just talking about this rather than the films
4533410 sonst machen wir den winzerk nig oder was mit hansi hinterseer die produktionen sind mir auch lieb und teuer aber tschuschenpower ich hab mich geradezu in jakob verliebt
4533411 ich find das sowas von zum kotzen die ganze patriarchalische schei e
4533412 man soll bei dem thema nicht st ndig angst haben etwas falsches zu sagen
4533413 nicht wenn jakob es sagt aber beim fortgehen zum beispiel
4533414 die ausl nder mal die hauptrollen spielen die haben sonst eh immer die arschkarte gezogen
4533415 proceeding with the pulp mill strengthens the underlying business adds demonstrable value that should lead to market upgrades and a positive share price re rating
4533416 i am pleased to get going but im just annoyed with myself i was trying a little too hard
4533417 it is the first qualification so the idea is to get in there and get the horse used to the arena it is an important competition but this day is the least important overall
4533418 the result of negative actions is the suffering of the lower realms so difficult to bear
4533419 in actuality sickness does not exist but in ones deluded experience the feeling of being sick occurs as the effect of ones own negative karmic actions that shows the unfailing quality of cause and effect it also shows that sickness is like a magical apparition it is felt and yet it is unreal in that way sickness is a spiritual teacher showing the nature of samsara it is the direct cause for cultivating the patience of accepting pain and for feeling compassion for people who suffer since sickness in this way is a most eminent method for purifying the misdeeds and obscurations gathered in former lives i do not deliberately try to get rid of being sick even if i were do die because of this sickness i will have no deep anguish so for me there is nothing more joyful than having a sick body

4533435 we can just let it go with no benefit to our customers or we can transfer it to other agencies in exchange for resources to fund facilities for dry year water supply reliability
4533436 its still very conceptual but we think a multi regional approach will benefit our customers
4533437 we gain revenues to pay for much needed infrastructure and participating agencies increase their ability to meet water demands in dry years
4533438 we have a very real need to offset costs for dry year infrastructure projects

4533454 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4533455 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4533456 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4533457 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4533458 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future

4533477 its great fun to crap on this business and those who seem to be flailing aimlessly within it such as some would say enfatico ive it myself but ive also worked in the business long enough to know that in most cases everything is usually blown out of proportion richard at dell has been active in the world of social media on behalf of dell for a long time if you recall dell hell the jeff jarvis thing a while after that dell realized they might as well join what they cant control and at least empower someone to engage omg im using buzzwords with the various communities out there so as to monitor learn and participate in whats being said about dell its easy to crap on dell theyre not the religion known as apple but when was the last time apple actually gave a shit about what people say dell at least is in the conversation richard is not just a blogger hes a representative of dell charged with joining the conversation youre welcome joe jaffe and making sure dell gets heard
4533478 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4533479 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4533480 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4533481 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4533482 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4533483 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4533484 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4533485 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4533486 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4533487 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4533488 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4533489 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4533490 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4533491 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4533492 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4533493 this is great now i just need to go to management and try and get the funding
4533494 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4533495 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4533496 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4533498 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4533499 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4533500 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4533501 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4533502 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4533503 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4533504 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4533505 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4533515 thanks to angela buchman i think we may be there were looking at records in fact i just got off the phone talking to my accountant and were really close on being able to say this is a banner year and a record year
4533516 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4533517 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4533518 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4533519 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4533520 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4533521 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4533522 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4533523 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4533524 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4533525 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4533526 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4533527 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4533528 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4533529 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4533530 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4533531 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4533532 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4533533 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4533534 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4533535 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4533536 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4533537 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4533538 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4533539 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4533540 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4533541 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4533542 theoretically everything is possible but in practice a world war is unlikely
4533543 europe does not want war nor does russia georgia does not count it is a puppet playing its local role georgia might have been a trigger and a casus belli if the world was ready for war but that is not so
4533544 world wars happen when the national interests of states are involved the conflict in ossetia pursues local not world goals the u s and europe are not prepared militarily to become embroiled in this mess the u s of course has its own interest to support its satellite georgia but not by jeopardizing its own national interests
4533545 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4533546 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4533547 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4533548 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4533549 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4533550 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4533551 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4533553 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4533571 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4533572 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4533573 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4533574 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4533575 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence
4533576 god willing by the middle of 2009 the power crisis on java and bali will begin to be overcome
4533577 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization
4533578 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4533579 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
4533580 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4533581 the awarding of this exploration licence will benefit the local area and the state
4533582 it will generate funding for infrastructure and services such as hospitals schools and roads
4533583 the nsw government says this is an exploration licence but really its the go ahead for massive coal mines that will rip the heart out of the gunnedah plains
4533584 the government will pocket 675 million but abandon farmers and its responsibility to tackle climate change all for the profits of a foreign owned company
4533585 this study needs to look at the underground and surface water flows of the liverpool plains prior to any further exploration or mining taking place as we are particularly concerned by the governments assertions that strict environmental regulation will prevent any impacts on aquifers
4533586 there are concerns from our members about the impacts of coal mining activities on agriculture and the failure by government to consider these impacts when deciding to release new mining tenements
4533587 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4533588 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4533589 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4533590 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4533591 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4533592 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4533593 you have to just be thankful for what you have today because you never know what may happen tomorrow
4533594 souls triumphant has something for everyone part love story part fantasy adventure and filled with action readers are thrust into the classic dilemma of good vs evil however this is not the tradition tale that has been written many times foley has delivered a refreshing and entertaining read for all ages adults and teens will finally have something they agree on this is a good book s william foley has penned a one of a kind novel where the characters while interacting within a fantasy world could not be more real questions of spirituality ethics and morals are presented through detailed plot lines that could easily be woven into the fabric of our daily lives foley has delivered a well constructed novel that combines interesting characters intriguing dialogue and explosive moral conflicts this rare mix will undoubtedly place foley on the favorites list of many readers
4533595 souls triumphant is an interesting and mature tale about angels and demons i found myself pleasantly surprised by foleys voice because he takes the whole mystical and spiritual aspect of heaven and hell and makes it his own this is a very intellectually written book and it is relies very heavily on dialogue rather than all action s william foley has written a book that is not the normal pop culture fluff that is being written any fan who is into religion spirituality and fantasy should pick this book up and lose themselves in the world of good and evil
4533596 in foleys first full length novel we encounter the ultimate struggle between good and evil souls triumphant introduces strong well defined characters some evil incarnate others venerable the plot offers a love story in an epic tale with a fantasy backdrop a page turner with a myriad of literary allusions it appeals to teens and adults who enjoy reading fantasy love stories and those who like literary allusions and heroic tales a delightful read teachers and librarians will be pressing this title into the hands of teens

4533599 the safety of workers is the top priority in the construction industry and we are working with the department of labour on a full investigation we have closed the site until monday and a number of people on site are being counseled
4533600 we learnt of the death of the worker at the peter mokaba site with great sadness we would like to send our most sincere condolences to his family we know the safety of all workers has always been paramount for all the construction companies contracted to build the 10 world cup stadiums the incident in polokwane today highlights however the dangers associated with constructing these world class stadia under very difficult conditions
4533601 there are over 20 000 workers on site daily at all 10 fifa world cup stadia we would like to pay tribute to each and every one of them today a worker once told me that he was not only helping to build a stadium but helping to build his country every one of the thousands of men and women working day and night on the world cup construction sites are the real heroes of this project and we would like to salute all of them as we mourn the tragic passing of the worker in polokwane today

4533608 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4533609 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4533610 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4533611 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4533612 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4533613 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged

4533616 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
4533617 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
4533618 because the story answers to most of the myths and preconceptions westerners already have about soviet life the problem will be to make sure that students read it with the same degree of resistance with which they would normally confront any other piece of fiction

4533620 was an egyptian public figure involved in the murder of suzanne tamin
4533621 this is pure intimidation of the press the public is entitled to know
4533622 it was a semi professional killing but unfortunately for him he left a vital clue behind the way in which the killing took place suggests a revenge motive as nothing was taken from the apartment and nothing was disturbed

4533631 d ont think for a minute that his aides arent paying attention and dont confuse the relative silence for a lack of action
4533632 we are aggressively attacking the factual errors in this book and making sure that everyone knows about the deeply offensive things corsi has said that will give readers of any political affiliation pause and ample reason to question the lies hes written
4533633 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and dick cheney get re elected four years ago this is his attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4533634 the idea that you can sit on something and hope it doesnt break through simply no longer applies
4533635 despite the fact that mr corsi has no credibility we understand the reality that its going to get covered and are going to aggressively work to make sure people understand that this is nothing more than a rehash of already debunked lies

4533645 since the end of last season we have been working hard to bring in players who can improve positions that we feel need improved in our team
4533646 its been an ongoing thing and it can be a slow process in the sense that most teams usually wait until the end of the transfer window before conducting their business
4533647 we have been in negotiations with a number of clubs and have missed out on a number of players
4533648 thats life but we move on and will continue to try and improve our squad
4533649 in the end we made a bid and the boy decided he wanted european football which is something we cant provide this season
4533650 we have lost out on that one but we have also missed out on others not only in this transfer window but in january and the previous summer also
4533651 so these things happen and its part of football we have to get on with it
4533652 aarons a younger boy who is in a slightly different circumstance to mendes
4533653 valencia gave us the opportunity to take him on loan and he is a very promising player
4533654 hes actually just started his pre season as hes been away with the spanish under 20 side so it might be a couple of weeks before we see him in action
4533655 but we all look forward to seeing him in a rangers jersey and we are delighted to have him
4533656 hearts are an intriguing team as i dont think anyone would ever question their capabilities
4533657 if everything settles down at tynecastle as it seems to be doing right now they have the capability to be one of the best teams in the league
4533658 they gave us a heavy defeat at the start of last season and on their day they can beat any team in the spl
4533659 so its a difficult game but we will be looking to win our first home fixture of the season
4533660 we got through our match against falkirk last weekend and the most important thing was that we took three points
4533661 that gave everybody a bit of a lift so we now go into this weekends game against hearts with our heads high
4533662 davie weir is back from suspension although nacho is still ruled out so apart from that there is no other changes apart from mendes also joining the squad
4533663 the idea of green collar jobs tends to bring up the best in people often people from the government from labor unions from the businesses people who work with community centers for young people they had never met in a conversation where they are trying to create something together when they met they had to fight about something this is an opportunity for people to say hey we have to come together and co create an opportunity here for our community this brings out incredibly creative thinking for the long term good of the community
4533664 as iraq gets better and better it will allow for force reductions
4533665 conditions now are looking as if the fundamental change of mission will be able to take place next year
4533666 from a uk point of view were getting pretty close to achieving what we went there to do to be honest
4533667 obviously theres considerable planning going on with the americans as to what the future construct in iraq is going to look like
4533668 the americans quite sensibly want the force reductions to be such that they can maintain the gains theyve made and obviously we will be in discussion with them military to military as to how we take that planning forward
4533669 i specifically found that she could not have killed this child based on the security and natures of the injuries she could not physically do it
4533670 during a dependency hearing another theory was advocated concerning the death of this infant and our office will review that theory
4533671 i distrust those people who know so well what god wants them to do because i notice it always coincides with their own desires
4533672 hedonism with rules isnt hedonism at all its the republican party
4533673 nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet

4533676 volksinitiativen die das prinzip der nicht diskriminierung in frage stellen
4533677 he was the conscience of the nation without him you feel as if no one is defending you
4533678 an obvious conflict between people of conscience and the authorities today we dont have that kind of conflict
4533679 in the time of sakharov and solzhenitsyn there was a big and brutal system
4533680 it was simpler to define who was an angel and who was a devil
4533681 just please be loyal to me and then you will be totally free in what you do with your private life
4533682 we can be buddhists or atheists we can send our children to america or to japan
4533683 it will send a message to everyone that this path doesnt work
4533684 they do not know what is friend they would rather have angry enemies than real friends
4533685 investors will not put up the money for a bypass pipeline
4533686 we will do anything not to allow georgia and ukraine to join nato
4533687 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals
4533688 that the crocodile is hungry well from the point of view of someone who wants to keep his own leg thats hard to accept
4533689 at the end of the day we were very close to war
4533690 these are not two different things because its not amputating hand its amputating head or heart no georgian president could survive if he gave up on abkhazia
4533691 if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for georgia then we have to make decision
4533692 a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice
4533693 their grand ambition is to undo the post cold war settlement and to re establish russia as a dominant power in eurasia
4533694 anything we can do to weaken the u s is good for russia
4533695 you will not believe this unless you see it approach
4533696 can you believe people use these photos to promote their business
4533697 10 online profile pictures that beg the question what were they thinking
4533698 our board of directors believes that repurchasing our american depositary shares is currently the best use of cash at this time in terms of creating shareholder value
4533699 is racing to sign big deals even at the eventual expense of margins ahead of lower cost suppliers
4533700 the commitment by pg amp e is a wake up call for congress to act on extending the itc when it returns from recess
4533701 we feel that acts like this are exactly what is needed to light the fire under the feet of our federal policy makers
4533702 the boy learns to make advances and rely upon the girl to repulse them whenever they are inappropriate to the state of feeling between the pair
4533703 the girl is reared to depend upon a slight barrier of chilliness which the boys learn to respect and for the rest to rely upon the men to approach or advance as warranted by the situation
4533704 both american soldiers and british girls accused one another of being sexually brash
4533705 i cant stress enough the importance of using the fine arts painting music writing to help children work through these situations
4533706 with the west coast projected for the high nineties and inland temperatures hitting triple digits special precautions make sense
4533707 young children the elderly and people with health problems can be more vulnerable to heat sickness than others but it is important for everyone to be prepared for heat emergencies
4533708 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4533709 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4533710 i cannot imagine what would drive somebody to do that
4533711 very strong very determined i dont know what id do in his position im proud of him i can tell you that im proud of him
4533712 if i may be so bold there was another president
4533713 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4533714 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4533715 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4533716 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4533717 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4533718 technically powerful but not as elegant as apples iphone and os x
4533719 i just wanted to make sure i have enough for the semifinal i did what i wanted to do top five nothing crazy i finished fourth thats good

4533721 preliminary findings reveal that the slide was partially inflated and the inflation bottle was empty
4533722 examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components nor any evidence of tampering
4533723 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4533724 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4533725 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4533726 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4533727 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4533728 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4533729 some of us are not connected with what we originially intended to be because of adverse circumstances lack of love sibling rivalry or the desire to please demanding parents we unconsciously changed our birth personality to fit our situation
4533730 it is very important for the liberals to avoid stephen harpers trap his idea is to call an election so that we cannot say to ndp supporters that we forced it in the end his ideal hope would be that after he does it we go around complaining that he broke the law the end result would be completely losing all the good press we might get by showing that we are proud of the green shift and ready to fight an election on it my sense of the scene is that the liberal caucus is ready for an election that being the case we should ramp up the rhetoric and dare harper to call a general election if mr dion has made the decision that i believe he has made then it is time to take the offensive that said i must insist that we not cry wolf again we are not calling a bluff or bluffing ourselves we are going all in and showing canadians our cards
4533731 young people who register to vote are more likely to become active and informed citizens of this state some of these young people will be our leaders of tomorrow now is the time to engage them
4533732 while fashion magazine has a single photographer author its still a magazine not a book so it doesnt follow my usual mode of slow solitary production its collaboration the ideas for the collaboration were formulated very quickly

4533734 ive been shooting with the d700 exclusively now for a week never picking up the d3 and the frame counter has just hit 10 000 so i thought i would pass along a couple of d700 thoughts it is without doubt the funniest little camera ive shot with in a long time even replacing the d200 as a favorite

4533766 let me say i am typically a sci fi fantasy fan however the blurb for this book was too good to pass up once i began reading i quickly realized this was an exceptionally well written story halfway through the story i had to remind myself that this was fantasy and i realized that was fine by me ms meilleur has a writing style that is enveloping yet tantalizing and the characters are fantastic i know this story has a hot spicy rating but ms meilleur tells the sex scenes in a very classy manner and with much creativity they were hot but oh so nicely done one thing i really admired about the lady prince is that it was a very refreshing story i never knew what to expect next and i was never disappointed if you like fantasies you cant miss this if you arent a fantasy fan this is the one to start with

4533785 while we believe new york amp co s fundamental business remains intact as value brands continue to resonate well with consumers in a challenging macroeconomic environment we believe current stock price levels are appropriately pricing in current earnings expectations
4533786 there is no question that oil going down will help the consumer
4533787 but i think youve got to balance it against all of the other issues that the consumer faces
4533788 macro economic conditions remained weak and the selling environment particularly as we moved into the back to school selling period was tough
4533789 renewed focus on core brands with good organic growth over recent periods
4533790 are particularly applicable to the toy industry to which moodys ascribes significant weighting
4533791 clear evidence that hasbros core brands are experiencing sustained organic growth
4533792 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4533793 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4533794 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4533795 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4533796 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4533797 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4533798 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4533799 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4533800 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4533801 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4533802 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4533803 we could never write a lease on these vehicles because the risks that chrysler was willing to take meant we couldnt be competitive
4533804 the manufacturers are going to be taking hits for the next few years because a lot of leased cars are still on the road
4533805 this is a product that until now we have not been able to compete in
4533806 its enormously competitive and it will be even more competitive as you need more ways to move cars in a reasonably depressed car market
4533807 just because chrysler got out of leasing doesnt mean we could be competitive we cant be as aggressive as they were the rebates are the only reason the math on this works
4533808 there is right and wrong and the two are very distinct when you look straight at them

4533814 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds ratereductions have led to less credit expansion to households andbusinesses than typically would be the case
4533815 while the second half of 2008 will likely be extremelysluggish the risk of a severe slowdown seems less likely todaythan predicted at the beginning of the year
4533816 we must be concerned about energy and food prices beingpassed through to core inflation we run the risk of persistentwidespread price increases being built into the expectations ofhouseholds and businesses
4533817 il sentimento pi forte e pi antico dellanimo umano la paura e la paura pi grande quella dellignoto

4533832 you never need to worry about her not practicing hard enough

4533840 what if i said stop praying what if i told you to stop talking at god for awhile but instead to take a long hard look at him before you speak another word

4533845 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4533846 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4533847 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4533848 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4533849 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4533850 wenn ich dies oder das erreichen oder verhindern will dann mache ich das immer so
4533851 during this season of practice ive noticed that nastia has been doing double routines on the floor exercise
4533852 sometimes she would do two in a row and that is a very difficult thing extremely tiring and exhausting
4533853 it was a great performance but it was so heartbreaking for shawn i could see how disappointed she was
4533854 ive said this before many times its really dangerous to be the it girl the year before the olympics on the one hand you have the enormous publicity and the endorsement money the other side of the sword are the expectations and pressure
4533855 the difference was a small slip on my grip on the high bar
4533856 but in most cases if you go against the athletic types the athletic types win mary lou retton carly patterson those types beat out longer lankier athletes who cant stick the landings like mighty mites history shows the shawn johnson type athlete usually wins because the scoring system rewards the athlete
4533857 by late this afternoon wed made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping again from some of our distribution centers
4533858 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday
4533859 but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4533860 everyone who should have received a disc but didnt because of our issues will receive a credit which we communicate to them via e mail
4533861 to me there were no signs no signs at all

4533864 abdoulaye is a fantastic player with top flight experience in abundance
4533865 we have worked extremely hard to conclude the deal and we are absolutely delighted to have signed a player of his quality
4533866 i really love the self sufficiency of it that i know where the produce started and what the process is
4533867 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4533868 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4533869 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4533870 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4533871 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4533872 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
4533873 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had

4533876 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4533877 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4533878 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4533879 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4533880 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4533881 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country

4533883 es destacable que la petici n de fianzas se empezase a generalizar durante la tregua cuando las acusaciones populares tuvimos que hacer el trabajo que no hac a la fiscal a
4533884 siempre ha hablado de que tiene que existir proporcionalidad y de que la fianza no ha de ser muy elevada para permitir la acusaci n

4533906 as a local government official ive had to deal with the effects of our failed federal immigration system that system is broken from top to bottom and needs wholesale reform
4533907 i can just tell you fairfax county is not going to go the route of some of our neighbors were not going to demagogue were not going to essentially roll back the welcome mat
4533908 whats the most disgusting thing youve had in your mouth
4533909 we would prefer no more reductions but we must keep expenses in line with revenue
4533910 we will thank them for their years of service and treat them in a way that acknowledges their valuable contributions
4533911 i dont think theres anyone there who cares one hoot about us other than our moneys good
4533912 the leadership is not in place unless you build a fire under their ass and im not kidding
4533913 if i was 60 years old i could beat both of these guys
4533914 it doesnt have anything to do with politics this is about america is what it is nothing like that would happen
4533915 these layoffs will affect several departments and will be completed by wednesday aug 20
4533916 a severance package will be provided to employees whose jobs are being eliminated
4533917 there are no plans for any further reductions at this time
4533918 i do wish i could say with certainty that this will be the final action needed to address the economic slump however we will continue to manage our expenses in line with revenue
4533919 i realize these payroll reductions are significant and will be difficult as we see fellow employees and friends who have worked hard alongside us impacted by this decision
4533920 we recognize we will lose dedicated employees who have helped us to past success and that will be tough on us all
4533921 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4533922 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4533923 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4533924 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4533925 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited

4533928 the construction of the table is of high quality though clearly built for function rather than form scratches nicks tiny splatters of solder and dried glue cover the surface
4533929 moving this table is at least a two person job

4533931 stacks of nondescript boxes practically fill this room the low ceiling and makes moving about the room a bit of a challenge a wooden staircase leads into the main space below
4533932 we need to come out with more intensity and we need more leadership
4533933 guys need to get after it better and bring more energy so it wasnt good enough we need to be a lot better
4533934 if you go down someone else steps up and has a day then youve lost your job so i always tell them every day that its survival of the fittest and if youre not tough enough to be out there then youre not going to play

4533965 early adopters waited in lines overnight to buy apples first generation iphone when it became available and now theyre looking for ways to swap it for apples latest iphone 3g with gps capability
4533966 david chen founder of nextworth solutions in massachusetts is ready to buy the old iphones for as much as the new iphone 3g costs while also helping the environment there is a huge demand for the first generation iphones because the battery for the older iphones is stronger chen told us
4533967 those who have an original first generation iphone may be tempted to buy the new iphone 3g when someone does that whats the best way to put the old model out to pasture there are plenty of options depending on what your situation is you can give it away sell it to an eager buyer or de phone it and use it as an ipod touch
4533968 ive had my new 3g apple iphone for about a month now and i thought id take a few minutes to write some of my thoughts and reflections on the experience for people who might be considering upgrading to the new 3g iphone
4533969 my experience with the new phone so far is that it is very similar to old phone but for people with a working first generation iphone i do not feel that upgrading is worth it after a month of hands on experience and here are my reasons why
4533970 eager punters cooing over their 3g iphones are finding the third generation connectivity not quite what they had hoped and according to some reports apples super phone is failing to meet the requirements of the 3g standard
4533971 apple took a lot of stick when the original iphone lacked 3g a decision that forced uk operator o2 to deploy an edge network just to support the 2
4533972 at first the networks looked to be at fault but the global nature of the problem belies that and t mobile netherlands has gone so far as to post information on the subject squarely blaming apples handset for the problems
4533973 om has complained about his frustration with the 3g iphone which has poor reception and forces him to spend more time on the 2 5g edge network than he thought but the issue may be with infineons 3g chip according to richard windsor an analyst with nomura securities in a research note today he said we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier that comment might cheer at amp t but its bad news for infineon and perhaps a warning to the chip industry about quality control
4533974 mobile internet and mobile broadband is not an always on experience and this isnt going to change soon near term there will always be places or situations where the cellular data network doesnt reach or where only a poor slow 2g signal is present product managers must design around it
4533975 the best current mobile applications and devices understand this and download what content messages they can as soon as they can
4533976 but apple has made a strategic decision with the iphone to target always on behaviours
4533977 the apple iphone meets the minimum requirements for use on a corporate network but companies that deploy the device will need to take a number of steps to prepare it for business use it research firm gartner said this week
4533978 the iphone can be safely used for a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and web browsing gartner said in a report however the firm advised businesses to deploy the iphone slowly and assess trade offs in hardware design and functionality relative to other options in use such as research in motions blackberry or devices running microsofts windows mobile
4533979 straight from the horses mouth apples iphones do indeed have the capability to check for and potentially defang software that apple deems unfit for the iphone
4533980 apple ceo steve jobs confirmed the existence of the so called kill switch capability following last weeks ruckus over early reports of just such a function the word from jobs was tucked at the bottom of a story in the wall street journal about apples hot as a pistol first month of sales at its app store
4533981 for those of you who have been following along my mom was seduced by steve jobs iphone this was and is an astonishing thing since my mom is very far away from being a techie
4533982 on the day of the iphone launch she waited in line at an at amp t store and i waited with her to get her new phone
4533983 my mom loves her phone but one issue came up which triggered an interesting thought she had a hard time using the phone initially because of her fingernails
4533984 now in reality my mom clipped her nails and everything was fine but i guess my question is whether that is a reasonable expectation in the product design were there any women on the product team were there any girly women on the product team women that like the idea of painted fingernails that extend a bit beyond the fingertip
4533985 people use their cell phones in ways that make them hard to study
4533986 why cant we get a definitive answer about cell phones and health
4533987 while a software based unlock allowing use on unauthorized carriers for the iphone 3g has yet to materialize one recognized vendor says it plans to ship a hardware based sim unlock for the device on august 20th
4533988 usb fever which offers a number of cases cables and other accessories for various iphone and ipod models says it will ship a sim unlock made of a very thin piece of fpc 0 10mm with a mounted micro controller that fits between an an operators sim card and the phones sim socket
4533989 brando already sells a sim card gadget thats claimed to unlock the original iphone for use on any network but now the online retailers launched an iphone 3g version
4533990 yes thats right according to brando this little plastic sim card sized device unties the iphone 3g from o2 in the uk or whichever carrier youre tied into elsewhere
4533991 i have confession to make i couldnt give a hoot about the iphone
4533992 as a technology pundit and entrepreneur im not supposed to say that
4533993 a story last week in a trade magazine for the consumer electronics industry said manufacturers of portable devices such as music and video players game machines and handheld gps units are concerned that the apple iphone is poised to cut into their business
4533994 they have good reason to worry not long after apple opened the iphone platform to let third party developers build new software the list of new applications and games jumped to more than 1 000
4533995 the iphone is steadily morphing into a pocket computer that just happens to include a phone
4533996 after spending the past few weeks in the company of apples newest iphone 3g i decided that apple picked the wrong name for the device
4533997 it should have been the icomputer or maybe the itool
4533998 true or false this year or next whatever the rumoured iphone nano story just wont go away and now it looks like at least one third party developers working away at products custom built for such a device
4533999 the daily mail this week broke news that apple plans to introduce a smaller less well featured iphone nano proposing this would appear in time for christmas and would be made available to o2s pay as you go customers
4534000 yesterday olive tree launched its first offerings for the iphone its biblereader and esv study bundle for bible reader
4534001 the biblereader by itself is free and the esv study bundle costs 24 99 in the past olive tree has always offered its biblereader software for free as a standalone product for hosting various modules available for purchase the iphone biblereader comes with nine versions of the bible included
4534002 i was surprised to see that the basic 1611 king james version was not included the esv bundle includes the esv obviously kjv the phillips nt the nine bibles listed above that are part of the basic package the matthew henry concise commentary the jamieson fausset brown commentary and the treasury of scripture knowledge
4534003 we are very pleased with the growth we have seen since the launch of our free iphone application a few weeks ago
4534004 we have grown our accounts by 500 since our launch just two months ago and we continue to see very strong growth on a daily basis we have heard from customers that our application is truly addictive and have some users who check their data over 10 times a day
4534005 because our service is so broad our free iphone application works equally well for those looking for an iphone finance application for example as those looking for an iphone travel application
4534006 the beauty of pageonce is that in addition to the two categories i just mentioned users can also access email social shopping and utilities all in one app
4534007 we are excited to continue releasing the finest in mobile content taking advantage of the unique capabilities of our partners like apple
4534008 we bring the highest quality mobile applications to the market for our partners and endusers making the mobile experience both fun and productive
4534009 we have a long standing relationship with pazzazz games and are delighted to bring gts world racing to the app store
4534010 i love that i can control the game holding and turning my iphone just like a steering wheel which really shows off how well the devices accelerometer works this is classic arcade racing fun

4534025 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
4534026 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
4534027 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
4534028 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
4534029 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
4534030 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
4534031 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
4534032 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
4534033 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
4534034 thats a phenomenal speed and most people wont be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds let alone two hours
4534035 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits
4534036 olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve
4534037 you know you should really just enjoy this judging by the school you go to i bet this is the last time in a long time that youll ever be inside a feminine shaped crevace

4534091 our athletes have the heart they just need the support to go with it
4534092 if we are going to be disappointed we should be disappointed in our government
4534093 i gather we have more medal hopes coming up in the back half of the games
4534094 well remain optimistic and obviously cheer for everyone who wears the maple leaf
4534095 either we are going to decide that we dont want to go to the olympics that we are going to be non competitive that we are going to sit here and watch other countries compete or we are going to join in
4534096 but if we go we should know our reputation hangs in the balance and we have to do better

4534114 people today are afraid to be alone this fear is a dominant mark of our society many now ceaselessly sit in the cinema or read novels about other peoples lives or watch dramas why simply to avoid having to face their own existence no one seems to want and no one can find a place of quiet because when you are quiet you have to face reality but many in the present generation dare not do this because on their own basis reality leads them to meaninglessness so they fill their lives with entertainment even if it is only noise the christian is supposed to be very opposite there is a place for proper entertainment but we are not to be caught up in ceaseless motion which prevents us from ever being quiet rather we are to put everything second so we can be alive to the voice of god and allow it to speak to us and confront us

4534151 with xiv ibm is just the latest big player to realize that there is a new type of solution needed to handle todays storage needs all data is not created equal and with the increase of web 2 0 telepresence multimedia video surveillance and other media intensive applications the legacy way of doing things is not working the xiv product mirrors much of what we already do which is based on nearly ten years of doing business with major broadcasters like turner
4534152 for one xiv is said to not use raid at omneon we believe raid is inadequate for highly scalable storage systems and to avoid the limitations of it we developed a dynamic data redundancy technique which ensures 100 uptime and does not require lengthy rebuild times when a drive fails also xiv is said to have a scale out architecture since we dont use raid and rely on a modular grid based approach customers can plug in any size box and use its full capacity immediately
4534153 and total system capacity can scale from a few terabytes to multiple petabytes within a single file system these are just a few of similarities between xiv and what weve been doing ibms entry into this market and the pending hulk maui products from emc validates our belief that not all data is created equal and a new approach is needed to handle todays media storage demands

4534177 its barely open its just open enough to take care of the final affairs but for all intents and purposes its closed down
4534178 in the end it was just too entangled to get a good deal in place and so we had to close down it was really kind of a wrenching horrible period actually and we learned a lot from it wed do things differently next time for sure

4534182 there is mounting agreement among automakers policymakers and environmentalists that the electrification of the automobile is inevitable and most of the major automakers are developing hybrid and plug in hybrid vehicles

4534195 you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada
4534196 when they got scared of us as a group playing against them thats when they started
4534197 that was a great feeling it really made me feel good
4534198 i believe in these characters and this story and its themes the things i want to say to the world are in this film
4534199 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
4534200 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
4534201 you no longer have to go through the charade of driving to a border or going through an airport to become landed you can go to the local citizenship and immigration canada office for that
4534202 whether you have a managerial or professional kind of job white collar kind of jobs or you have blue collar jobs construction worker farm workers chefs you should have equal opportunity to stay in canada
4534203 weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
4534204 this is extremely stressful for them and for many many other people who love and sup port them
4534205 its the will of parliament and we know its the will of can adians generally
4534206 the way that your govern ment is treating these soldiers is shameful and completely out of whack with that very honour able distinguished canadian tradition
4534207 there are other means to come to this country than through that than taking ad vantage of this system that really helps people in genuine need
4534208 hold it fellas im afraid youre just too darn loud next please bring the next group please
4534209 theres been more thinking about the implications of being a christian on being a lawyer and on the law
4534210 every time i hear a lawyer speak to a group of fellow believers
4534211 big change in the type of law students they are coming to law school with a serious faith
4534212 in three days you shall live i gabriel command you
4534213 the problem here is that theres not enough text to be able to be really confident about what the passage itself is reading in order to build a theory around it
4534214 it just means that there were more persons in early judaism other than jesus and his followers who were talking about a dying and rising messiah thats not a problem for christianity as far as i can see
4534215 the text deals with some type of angelic communication but beyond that its very hard to tell what all is going on
4534216 i think this stone is as significant as many of the dead sea scrolls but it doesnt seem to have any value for the discussion of jesus except by way of general background text like the dead sea scrolls
4534217 my goal in becoming a lawyer has never been to take on unjust laws
4534218 it is to be able to work with people and demonstrate integrity and excellence thats how i am going to change the world by the way i conduct myself
4534219 i gathered it was not the truth so i called him on it
4534220 i told him i want to know the truth whether it hurts me or helps me
4534221 it was really strange to have an attorney hold me to the truth
4534222 any civil attorney can find a million frivolous things to file on but its almost stealing
4534223 why file it if its not going to advance my clients case its a big temptation to raise billable hours
4534224 pretty much with every case i feel i can help somebody
4534225 people dont come to an attorney unless they need help
4534226 i rarely mention that i am a christian unless someone asks i had one client who said to me i know you are a christian i said oh how is that he said i just knew there was something about you the way you treat me and talk to me that was an amazing compliment and i give the credit to the lord for using me that way i really want my actions to speak loudly to people
4534227 hes going to touch the ball twenty times a game
4534228 never being happy isnt the same as being unhappy is it
4534229 i like your nose ring did it hurt or is that ethnic
4534230 det lyder som noget fra en amerikansk film hvis det virkelig er rigtigt s synes jeg det er utroligt bet nkeligt at man den ene dag beder ham v re meddeler og den n ste dag sigter ham for alvorlige terror det h nger ikke sammen politiet m jo fors ge at holde rene linjer de kan jo ikke begynde at anvende forbryderne til at efterforske forbrydelser
4534231 det er uheldigt hvis det er s dan at vi p nogen m de fra statens side samarbejder med terrorister

4534241 approximately 790 million people in the developing world are still chronically undernourished almost two thirds of whom reside in asia and the pacific
4534242 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4534243 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4534244 in a democratic spirit and in accordance with the constitution
4534245 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4534246 we now have so many different bites at the apple
4534247 with the amount of fragmentation that is created both in terms of channels as well as the different formats by which advertising is being delivered it is putting pressure on traditional audience and measurement services
4534248 rest on a foundation of how many people were exposed to my creative
4534249 qualities of eyeballs and various engagement measures that have been developed that are useful to identifying whether some exposures have higher qualities than others
4534250 if we can continue getting these tough wins then we can win the gold medal
4534251 it doesnt matter if the victories are easy or difficult the important thing is the gold medal
4534252 the game was just like a battle to see whos going to fight to the end
4534253 and like a gamble to see whos going to win
4534254 when youre going through something like this you feel like theres not a whole lot you can do and so for me this feels like an opportunity to do something
4534255 the people involved are very appreciative of all you do
4534256 my moms death inspired me to raise awareness and educate people let as many people as i can know that its not an old persons disease this is affecting people in their 30s to 50s
4534257 wir hoffen jedoch dass wir eine gleichstellung von fondssparpl nen mit lebensversicherungen noch im rahmen des jahressteuergesetzes 2009 erreichen k nnen

4534259 still down 24 hours and counting this ceased to be funny long ago any of the other users here have any recommendations for another e mail provider its time to start voting with our feet and leaving for greener pastures
4534260 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests
4534261 my sources i do have some really tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4534262 more and more tvs are supporting this refresh rate and even using it as advertising copy in their features list
4534263 theyre the ones who are consulted when their friends want to buy a tv a stereo or a
4534264 but right now their recommendation is suffering from those two issues the second of which is going to bite us in the ass if it isnt fixed soon because are not exactly uncommon and unless i miss my mark anyone buying one of those sexy new 500
4534265 youre not allowed to say my name anymore im the tibu version of he who must not be named google is my mortal enemy now im traveling incognito today
4534266 and the mask is part of your disguise as well
4534267 its a mike james mask mike has never been to a tibu event before no one will ever suspect its me ive even been practicing talking like him lets see um that cooze got me so horny i could spew enough man juice in her mouth to make her ears look like a milk fountain not bad eh
4534268 you should like enter the talent show and all that
4534269 on second thought maybe not i mean if im mike then id need to perform one of his talents do they allow profanity or cunnilingus on stage
4534270 i say sit back and relax colon we should be in for a good show
4534271 its not too late to get back and catch americas next top model you know
4534272 they say that hearing is the first thing to go
4534273 but these two here say that youre in their seats statler waldorf meet dale and um
4534274 hey maybe thats not a bad idea the amazing colon rescuing the masses from critical punctuation errors
4534275 think of all the semicolon abuse youll prevent i can see a great horror post out of it course the amazing cologne can be pretty terrifying too think of all the horrible first dates and locker room stories all the people that have spontaneously gone blind on subways and in restaurants
4534276 while you two plot your course of olfactory anarchy and grammatical heroism you mind moving out of our seats
4534277 you guys are really statler and waldorf i mean the statler and waldorf it would be an honor if you let us share these seats with you
4534278 what do you say its nice to share you know dont you like sharing
4534279 mostly we just sit in an old trunk let me tell you frank ozs jock is nothing to write home about
4534280 either way i feel bad for this rick james fellow
4534281 hes quite the svengali ive been told he has more illegitimate children than thomas jefferson
4534282 much like the father in a christmas story mike has woven a tapestry of obscenity and semen that now covers the greater five boroughs
4534283 but the amazing colon here was thinking about becoming a last minute entry
4534284 you gonna show everybody how to separate two clauses or how to properly format a ratio or something
4534285 is there even going to be anything worth seeing today
4534286 i cant speak for the muppet side of things but tibus got some pretty good talent
4534287 but i hear she has a wonderful show involving a bubble bath and a sponge
4534288 kimberleyrockdales got her yodeling act mscofields doing some reconstructive dental work on bob
4534289 lawdog and grover are going to show everyone how to make a bong out of fifty household objects
4534290 as long as its not a repeat of last year
4534291 what do you guys think of the big showdown this year
4534292 i mean for the talent show you know asnos and guesser versus bert and ernie
4534293 bert and ernie have skid marks in their shorts that are older than those other two
4534294 if bert and ernie win then well get you a night out on the town with ms scarlet there hows that
4534295 im kind of surprised this didnt happen in florida first
4534296 ive always been very much into constitutional rights and gun rights
4534297 it seems retarded that you cant protect yourself on an open campus its ridiculous
4534298 there will obviously be people who are against it and their thinking is that if there is a gun anywhere that there will be shooting

4534305 das leben ist kannibalisch das eine ich frisst das andere ich immer ist jemand dabei an einem anderen zu nagen aus neid aus profitgier aus angst wissen sie die vorstellung in einem zimmer zu schlafen wo nicht irgendwo eine flasche steht finde ich ziemlich schrecklich es k nnte ja immerhin sein dass ich nachts aufwache und einen schluck brauche
4534306 ich habe dir gesagt dass ich mich vor der verlogenheit ekele aber in wirklichkeit ekele ich mich vor mir selbst deshalb warte ich dass ich den knacks in meinem kopf sp re und ich nicht mehr daran denken muss ich sch me mich n mlich big daddy deshalb betrinke ich mich und nur wenn ich betrunken bin kann ich mich selbst ertragen
4534307 aber was ist morgens wenn du aufwachst dann ist die wahrheit doch wieder da du bedauerst dich nur selbst ja das ist es du bemitleidest dich nur selbst du hast ja bobby nicht get tet du und skipper es gibt so viele die so leben nicht erwachsen werden k nnen ihr seid ja noch in einer kinderwelt spiele spielen tore schie en nur keine sorgen nur keine verantwortung du wei t es noch nicht das leben ist kein kinderspiel du willst immer nur das abenteuer der gro e mann sein siegen du bist ein drei igj hriges kind wenn du 50 bist bildest du dir ein beifall zu h ren wo keiner ist ich wei wie du dein leben weiter verbringen wirst du wirst weiter tr umen und weiter trinken aber die wirklichen helden leben vierundzwanzig stunden jeden tag und nicht einmal zwei stunden in einem spiel verlogenheit die hasst du doch so sehr nicht wahr du sagst du kannst nicht mit der l ge leben aber du machst dir was vor was ist denn wahrheit doch nur schwei und rechnungen bezahlen und mit einer frau zusammen sein m ssen die du nicht mehr liebst du musst dich damit abfinden dass tr ume nicht wirklichkeit werden und erst nach deinem tod wird dein name in der zeitung gedruckt sein merk dir das du bist noch nicht richtig erwachsen mein junge erwachsene legen nur auf bei einem freund in not und sie legen auch nicht auf bei ihren frauen das ist die wahrheit und du kannst ihr nicht ins gesicht sehen
4534308 das ist nicht wahr menschen sind dir gleichg ltig du hast von cooper und mir verlangt dass wir kinder in die welt setzen sollen warum
4534309 weil ich will dass etwas von mir weiterlebt es soll mit dem tod nicht alles vorbei sein mein vater hat mir einen einzigen armseligen alten koffer hinterlassen und soll ich dir sagen was darin gewesen ist nur eine zerrissene alte uniform aus dem spanisch amerikanischen krieg das war sein einziges verm chtnis also gleich null und dann habe ich diese plantage aus dem nichts aufgebaut
4534310 ja er war ein landstreicher der bekannteste vagabund der die g terwagen unsicher machte manchmal hat er auch als landarbeiter gearbeitet ich war immer bei ihm ich sa auf der erde und wartete dass er mir was zu essen bringen w rde ich kannte nur hunger das selt same war ich habe mich f r ihn gesch mt ich war neun jahre alt da fuhren wir mit g terwagen durchs ganze land das ist dir erspart geblieben und vieles andere auch du wirst mich nicht einmal so begraben m ssen wie ich ihn ich habe ihn auf einer wiese neben dem bahn gleis begraben wir rannten einem g terzug hinterher als sein herz versagte du wirst es nicht glauben er hat gelacht als er starb
4534311 vermutlich ber sich selbst ein richtiger vagabund nur leere taschen kein geld drin keine zukunft keine vergangenheit
4534312 vielleicht hat er deswegen gelacht weil er gl cklich gewesen ist vater gl cklich weil du bei ihm warst das machte ihn froh weil er wusste dass er gar nicht einsam sein konnte
4534313 ach ich will nicht dar ber sprechen ja ich habe ihn geliebt solange ich denken kann habe ich nichts mehr geliebt als diesen alten vagabunden
4534314 und du sagst er hat dir nichts weiteres hinterlassen als einen sch bigen koffer mit einer zerrissenen alten uniform
4534315 ja das nat rlich auch ich habe jetzt keine angst vor dem sterben mehr ich habe den mut zu sterben aber hast du auch den mut zu leben
4534316 wir k nnten es versuchen wir wollen damit anfangen dass wir uns gegenseitig die treppe hinauf helfen
4534317 i just liked it right from the start i like the fast flowing corners and there seems to be plenty of grip in the wet in the free practice it was dry and its a bit bumpy but my motocross helps there and i dont mind the bike jumping around a bit
4534318 i just enjoy this track fast corners and it seems to suit my style im looking forward to the race wet or dry
4534319 the first qualifying session was so bad i was so terrible
4534320 then in the second session i began to get a bit of feeling for the track and the grip and started to go better i moved up the leaderboard and my lap time is not so different from jd and the other guys around me so i am quite happy with that
4534321 i was pretty slow at first i just didnt have any feeling for what the track was like then i started to feel the grip and got going a bit in the end it was not too bad
4534322 it would have been nice to be fastest but there was no sense in crashing and the front row is good all i need is a good start now
4534323 its always fun to have a dry race but for me the wet will be ok too im looking forward to it
4534324 i have raced here twice before in the european championship and i really like the track i like the way it goes up and down hill the fast corners for me the race can be wet or dry i dont mind

4534332 two days ago he came to me and said mister i renew my contract for five years

4534334 its fantastic for chelsea because lampard is not one player he is not only a player but a symbol for chelsea

4534336 it never crossed my mind that people would think this was shocking inappropriate uncalled for or whatever anyone might think about the comment
4534337 im not going to lie i loved this finally some attention on my meaningless little blog in the corner of the internet so i spent the day reading all the posts all over the internet and even posting in the comment section on a few its really been great reading

4534351 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4534352 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4534353 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4534354 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4534355 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4534356 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil

4534368 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4534369 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4534370 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4534371 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4534372 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4534373 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4534374 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4534375 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4534376 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4534377 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

4534391 the conditions of families living in poverty are unacceptable poverty is a wide reaching problem and affects the quality of life for us all
4534392 every person deserves to have a safe place to live adequate healthcare food and decent educational and employment opportunities i am proud to sign this bill today which will help us start making real progress toward eliminating poverty in illinois
4534393 as one of the wealthier states in the nation it is important that we in illinois set a high goal for the elimination of poverty
4534394 by creating this commission of individuals determined to improve the quality of life for our poorest residents we can develop a framework recommend specific legislative actions and work together to realize our goal of reducing poverty
4534395 the creation of this commission marks a turn for the better in eliminating poverty in illinois by looking into this in a committed way so we can take major steps forward
4534396 the elimination of poverty requires a three tiered approach including the removal of structural and policy barriers the creation of economic opportunity and the development of strategies for self sufficiency
4534397 i look forward to working with the commission members to design a viable poverty reduction blueprint for illinois
4534398 the creation of the commission on the elimination of poverty is an important step towards realizing human rights in illinois
4534399 this commission has the potential to fundamentally change the way we address poverty through creating a substantive measurable plan to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015 i applaud the general assembly and governor blagojevich for demonstrating their commitment to illinois most vulnerable residents

4534408 the idea that inbreeding causes health problems in particular dog breeds is not a new one but we believe ours is the first scientific study to explore this issue and analyse the extent of inbreeding in a systematic way across many breeds we hope that following our work dog breeders will make it a high priority to increase the genetic diversity within different breeds otherwise we will see growing numbers of dogs born with serious genetically inherited health problems

4534410 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
4534411 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4534412 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4534413 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4534414 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4534415 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4534416 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4534421 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4534422 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4534423 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4534424 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4534425 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4534426 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4534427 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4534428 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4534434 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4534435 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4534437 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4534438 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4534439 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4534440 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4534441 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4534442 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4534443 theres no magic bullets for prrs theres going to be incremental progress over the next few years

4534447 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4534448 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4534449 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4534450 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4534451 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4534452 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4534453 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4534454 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4534455 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4534456 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4534457 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4534458 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4534459 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4534460 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4534461 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4534462 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4534463 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4534464 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4534465 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4534466 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4534467 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4534468 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4534469 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4534470 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4534471 its an incredible concentration of threatened and endangered species that are going to be affected by this road
4534472 highlights the fact that the proposed toll road route in particular the san mateo creek watershed is a vital environmental resource
4534473 a lot of work went into designing the alignment to avoid the most sensitive areas of habitat
4534474 its been a highly politicized process that hasnt relied on the best available science and thats one of the bedrock requirements of the endangered species act
4534475 which does not consume physical arrows and mages transform their spells into instant spells by applying elemental catalysis
4534476 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4534477 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4534478 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4534479 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4534480 i didnt break 11 seconds ive seen women down here faster than me
4534481 i can tell my children and my friends for the rest of my life that i ran against the worlds fastest man
4534482 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4534483 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4534484 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4534485 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4534486 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4534487 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4534488 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4534489 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4534490 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4534493 i immediately began looking at retail spaces in the city to get an idea of what was possible
4534494 i played a ton of arcade games as a kid thanks to generous parents and arcade games conveniently located any place we went
4534495 i was hooked from the very start and also have fond memories of legend of kage followed by black tiger a bit later on
4534496 arcade gaming died out in the u s for many reasons but i dont think any of them are the reasons most people think about
4534497 the number one reason it died here is because of our coinage system the japanese coin system is coincidentally perfectly made for arcade gaming with 50 yen and 100 yen denominations 50 cents 1 dollar
4534498 ultimately i dont think its a matter of japanese people being any more into gaming than americans
4534499 arcades have been successfully marketed in japan and adapted through an era of change the u s operators just gave up
4534500 japan is a culture built around easy transportation in metro areas and there is always an arcade close by if youre in the city
4534501 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
4534502 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today

4534507 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4534508 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4534509 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4534510 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4534511 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4534512 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4534513 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through

4534516 there will be a great sigh of relief in nato circles that khalid will be gone
4534517 the army particularly is whats important because nato diplomats and nato officials have all complained bitterly about the corruption of the afghan police and mr khalid was particularly tied to the police
4534518 perhaps this means a larger role for the afghan army in the kandahar area rather than the police who really have a bad reputation

4534551 the setup of this task force reflects rics dedication to fully support the government in conducting the urban renewal strategy review in all stages aging buildings in disrepair and inadequate urban planning is creating more problems than expected the recent detrimental fire hazard occurred at cornwall court which has brought along tremendous loss of human lives and property is also a result of aging structure and urban mix this task force brings together key representatives from the public sector private practice and enterprises and also academia aiming at offering professional and pragmatic solutions for the government while allowing the public to share the positive results at the end
4534552 since the promulgation of the current urs in 2001 to guide the work of the ura the government and the authority have accumulated a lot of experience in urban renewal work at the same time there have been very noticeable changes in the values and aspirations of the public with regard to heritage conservation preservation of social networks and building maintenance and restoration in response to these changes the government has introduced new policies and measures these include a new heritage conservation policy announced by the chief executive in his 2007 08 policy address as well as various statutory and administrative measures to enhance building maintenance taking all these into account we believe it is an opportune time to conduct a comprehensive review of the urs to ensure that it will continue to reflect the values and priorities of the community

4534598 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues

4534602 in july fixed asset investment again accelerated to a certain extent
4534603 that will help in tackling the issues arising from a weakening in external demand
4534604 urban fixed asset investment has maintained a growth level of about 25 percent every month
4534605 domestic demand will certainly have to play the leading role in creating economic growth
4534606 its out of the question that current policy will be further tightened
4534607 as the authorities appear to have now shifted their top priority from curbing inflation to fuelling economic growth investors keen to enter the chinese market have been given an injection of confidence

4534614 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards

4534616 its true that as the cleveland plain dealer pointed out in 2003 davis lobbied the senate to accept the proposal by dhl to buy airborne express for 1 05 billion airborne express at the time ran the airport and package sorting facility in wilmington
4534617 c an mccain and davis really be held responsible for job cuts five years later after the initial acquisition created growth for the town and would an american company really have acted any differently if it found a way to cut cost to keep steady or increase profit
4534618 lets see how you act after getting beaten for five years
4534619 making exxon surrender money that is now falling into its lap would not necessarily affect its longer term plans or incentives indeed some of big oils windfall already will go to the government the more profit the companies earn the more corporate income tax they pay but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing

4534751 hoy no pudimos hacer un entrenamiento bueno y fue quiz s el entrenamiento que m s necesit bamos por el hecho de que es previo al partido
4534752 necesitaba hacer un poco de pelota parada y trabajar un poco el partido t cticamente
4534753 es una desventaja porque obviamente siempre es en el d a anterior al partido cuando dej s claras un poco las cosas donde se puede tener un poquito de confianza con la pelota y trabajar los tiros libres no pudimos hacer lo que quer amos pero el partido hay que tomarlo con seriedad como siempre
4534754 no creo por m s que no corras 40 minutos un d a antes no creo que al otro d a no vayas a poder correr los 40 minutos yo creo que no influye para nada
4534755 nos vamos a enfrentar a un rival muy dif cil con jugadores de gran categor a
4534756 y vamos a tener que hacer un gran trabajo si queremos pasar de esta ronda
4534757 holanda siempre se caracteriz por ser un equipo de calidad de tratar de jugar bien al f tbol y tiene jugadores importantes como babel liverpool drentehe real madrid maduro valencia y makaay que con su experiencia es un jugador clave para ellos
4534758 yo creo que se van a defender primero opin monz n
4534759 contra argentina todos buscan defenderse primero y despu s tratan de salir a atacarnos
4534760 estamos tranquilos y vamos a tratar de salir a obtener un buen resultado
4534761 pero es lindo que podamos contar con un hincha como diego para nosotros es una referencia es alguien que realmente para el f tbol argentino y para el f tbol mundial impone much simo
4534762 vamos a tratar de darle una alegr a ya que hace el esfuerzo de poder venirse hasta ac ojal que le podamos regalar un triunfo
4534763 el hecho de que est ac representa algo grand simo para nosotros ojal que lo podamos ver antes del partido
4534764 es un grande que le trajo mucha alegr a a la argentina
4534765 para nada ser una presi n al contrario es lindo poder disfrutar de que maradona est alentando al equipo ojal le podamos regalar un triunfo
4534766 le digo a anabel que queda mucho pero que ya estamos luchando por las medallas
4534767 es una experiencia que ya he pasado pero mantengo las ganas y la ilusi n de intentarlo de nuevo son los ltimos juegos y se vive de otra manera estoy en mi mejor momento al final de mi carrera deportiva

4534771 pues mejor ojal que vivi tenga dos una de oro y otra de plata
4534772 pero siempre hemos cre do que pod amos y eso ha sido lo importante
4534773 ha sido un partido largo con muchos altibajos en el marcador mucha tensi n al final han sido tres horas hemos tenido que remontar varias veces eso te crea un estado de tensi n que te hace sentirte cansada
4534774 el partido duro que hay que pasar en cada torneo
4534775 no fue una pelea f cil porque me tuve que enfrentar al p blico al rbitro y a los jueces pero consegu la victoria gracias a la gran preparaci n f sica con la que he llegado al torneo
4534776 llegu a los juegos ol mpicos para estar en las finales y no me conformo con la medalla de bronce
4534777 hice una buena pelea sal decidido a darle con todo
4534778 me siento triste porque no perd la pelea me la quitaron
4534779 los jueces s lo favorecen a los chinos asi ticos y europeos

4534782 ocupar el lugar de doda es muy dif cil pero todos me han apoyado mucho
4534783 creo que he hecho un buen trabajo teniendo en cuenta que es la primera vez que estoy compitiendo estoy satisfecha con el caballo porque estuvo a la altura
4534784 muy unidos lo que ayuda mucho al funcionamiento de los jinetes
4534785 el caballo me dej contento teniendo en cuenta el poco tiempo que llevo con l y que no tiene ninguna experiencia en esta altura estoy m s que satisfecho
4534786 por ahora yo veo que es una competencia en la que mi rival es la pista y tendr que tratar de superarla
4534787 no he estado en mi mejor d a no sal muy inspirado a la arena
4534788 now there are questions people arent just jumping on the bandwagon people are starting to thoughtfully think about what the ramifications would be to nashville as a whole
4534789 the fact that its been deferred indefinitely gives us the opportunity to come back before this body when we are ready and we feel that weve answered all the questions
4534790 and because of that i cannot access the drive usually this kind of problem occurs in cd dvd that has a autorun inf and the
4534791 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it
4534792 there is a full dialogue with the american administration on how to deal with the iranian issue first and foremost through diplomatic and political means while no option should be taken off the table
4534793 russias position right now is that they are trying to reaffirm their status in their world
4534794 they have an interest in showing that they are tough in south ossetia and that they are also not going to be pushed around by the west when it comes to iran
4534795 the financial world is not just in the western hemisphere
4534796 irans call on international financing for oil and gas can easily be moved to the east from the west
4534797 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
4534798 preliminary findings reveal that the slide was partially inflated and the inflation bottle was empty
4534799 examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components nor any evidence of tampering
4534800 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4534801 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4534802 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4534803 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4534804 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4534805 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4534806 el presidente lvaro uribe le est mientiendo al pa s
4534807 mire yo le soy sincero yo creo que una operaci n tan exitosa como sa por un s mbolo de esos que se la mancille es una franca estupidez
4534808 sin un solo tiro hay quince personas libres una ciudadana colombo francesa que llevaba seis a os cautiva tres ciudadanos norteamericanos que llevaban seis a os y once soldados y polic as colombianos que en algunos casos llevaban m s de diez a os secuestrados
4534809 tratar de medir ese balance de una manera distinta es una equivocaci n
4534810 las farc no pueden ser un tema que divida al continente a pa ses hermanos una organizaci n criminal como sta no puede generar siquiera discusiones en ese sentido
4534811 tres de sus m s altos dirigentes han muerto en los ltimos seis meses nueve de sus dirigentes de primer y segundo nivel han muerto es una guerrilla que est siendo marginalizada que est teniendo cada vez menos control territorial yo creo que colombia est viendo el fin de este tipo de violencia
4534812 el tipo de organizaciones inhumanas salvajes crueles que son para violar todos los derechos humanos
4534813 inclusive ese discurso en muchos sectores europeos y latinoamericanos ha comenzado a cambiar al ver la real realidad
4534814 se est procurando recomponer a trav s de la oea hasta normalizarlas es lo m s conveniente para los pa ses
4534815 el comercio es creciente las relaciones son francas y tienen un gran futuro
4534816 no podemos permitir que una organizaci n criminal por las farc impida que dos pa ses con esa historia com n ese cord n umbilical que nos une se destruya

4534818 weve had to make some cuts some of us couldnt live with but have to live with
4534819 they were built with a lot of thought they are being taken down without thought
4534820 we seem to just be going along with the governor the governor has no agenda other than to reduce

4534825 you just hit the guy as hard as you can
4534826 my message to them is about how to mentally deal with things
4534827 some of what i talk about will be conditioning of the body but my belief is that everything starts with the mind you win a fight not with your strength but with your mind
4534828 and afterwards build thine house when though the blessing of god upon thy diligence and industry thou art become rich or however hast such a competent substance as to be able to build a good house and furnish it in a handsome manner then do it but first take care of the main point that you have a sufficiency to finish it see the advice of christ luk 14 28
4534829 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4534830 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4534831 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4534832 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4534833 its customary for the vans to stop and water their runners during the leg
4534834 hey were always going to need to have some contact with the world you yourself have said bunker that you cannot make sponges salt or aluminum foil so you are going to have to buy some things
4534835 we must always have contact with the world so we might as well have more contact than less
4534836 since we must always buy some things why not buy as much as possible
4534837 well if you arent living this completely separated hermit life with absolutely no contact with the outside world making all your own equipment growing 100 of your own food then who are you to preach to me were all dependent on the world etc etc etc
4534838 almost every toothbrush has some small microscopic amount of fecal coliform bacteria on it so we might as well eat feces
4534839 since many things we eat have ingredients which would be poisonous in large amounts or if delivered in certain ways and we eat them anyway then eating and drinking poison is perfectly fine in any amount
4534840 since we must all have contact business discourse with the world then any contact business discourse with the world is authorized and acceptable to god
4534841 everyone to the right of me is too far to the right and everyone to the left of me is too far to the left therefore i am the standard
4534842 everyone to the right of me is a fascist and everyone to the left of me is a communist
4534843 i am the standard therefore anyone more separated than me is anywhere from a bit extreme to violating gods commandment to go out into the world and evangelize create disciples etc
4534844 well this is where god has us now therefore this is where god wants us
4534845 but i agree with what you have said and the need for agrarianism separation simplicity and god honoring sustainability
4534846 its a process so my speed is as good as any
4534847 what happens to my system if i cannot get batteries
4534848 what happens to me and my family if i am dependent on this system
4534849 to preserve food for long term storage by preparing it in cans or jars and utilizing heat and or pressure
4534850 if you will free range your animals which i recommend then you need to study on pasture management and rotation so you can do this without constantly having to buy feed and supplements
4534851 anyone who rightfully distrusts and dislikes amerikan imperialism are going to attack our systems of electricity and water
4534852 ich h tte nie gedacht dass es reicht nie da h tte ich keine zwei cent drauf gewettet

4534861 if you want to be a successful off grid agrarian homesteader then make a mistake a day for 11 years and youll be right where i am
4534862 the problem is that knowing how to make pots would be great but it takes a huge investment in time money and equipment and how many pots can you use are you going to just keep making pots after you have all you need or are you going to sell them do you have a market for pots
4534863 go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven
4534864 we will not walk therein god has said that the old paths are better than the new ones that is a fact declared from heaven learn it and love it
4534865 everythings gonna be put on electricity and run on a paying basis out with the old spiritual mumbo jumbo the superstitions and the backward ways editors note this means christianity and agrarianism were gonna see a brave new world where they run everybody a wire and hook us all up to a grid yes sir a veritable age of reason like the one they had in france not a moment too soon
4534866 or world changing event happened how long would you be able to keep doing something you are now doing if the world was never again going to revert back to normal
4534867 i have seen just the land you are describing it is in a picture hanging on the wall in a restaurant in town
4534868 michael i am single and unattached i want to live the agrarian life but i have no money to speak of some debt and very few skills
4534869 the department has relied on unsupported claims and shoddy studies by the seed companies
4534870 theres no way of knowing what the downstream effects will be or how genetic engineering might affect the environment we have such a miserably poor understanding of how the organism develops from its dna that i would be surprised if we dont get one rude shock after another
4534871 starvation and malnutrition are very real problems but they are caused by unequal distribution of wealth not by food scarcity according to the united nations world food program there is currently more than enough food produced to feed everyone on the planet an adequate and healthy diet
4534872 block scheduling costs 16 to 18 percent more to operate
4534873 it lets the teacher spend more time with the students to help them understand the material since we switched weve seen test scores and the graduation rate go up
4534874 the time to change is when you open up a new school so you can move personnel
4534875 instead of losing staff you can simply move them to the new high school
4534876 what you must weight is whether this is worth the cost
4534877 it is more costly you have to decide if its more cost effective
4534878 its truly a lot to consider no matter what you decide to do there are sacrifices you must make
4534879 were standing up for people who need a little help
4534880 its ambitious but we know its the best way to help people in walton county
4534881 we want to look back and say walton county has done it again
4534882 you really find out what youre made of when you go through those challenging times
4534883 if any team didnt need to play three games in 24 hours it was our beat up team but the human spirit is something else and thats just for a sports championship you represent the united way a way to help people
4534884 we were focused on what we could do to make tomorrow better and win that next game
4534885 you have to want a little more out of your campaign
4534886 since eighty five percent of our current budget is made up of salaries and benefits for our employees we cant make cuts there in the middle of the school year
4534887 additionally we have certain fixed expenses like fuel and utilities that we cant cut
4534888 governments and school systems across the country are dealing with the same economy it is tough all over we are just going to have to tighten our spending and make cuts through attrition
4534889 we are scrutinizing the social circle city schools budget and hope to accommodate the governors budget cuts with minimal if any impact on instruction
4534890 walton county as most governments is struggling to operate efficiently with keeping taxes low for the citizens
4534891 if the state comes along and withdraws what they have committed to contribute then it will just fall once again on the local officials to make up the shortfall

4534893 i really love the self sufficiency of it that i know where the produce started and what the process is
4534894 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4534895 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4534896 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4534897 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4534898 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4534899 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
4534900 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had

4534921 temos alguns po os perfurados alguns volumes apenas em tupi no que se refere ao que conhecemos a petrobras pode desenvolver o problema em rela o ao que n o conhecemos isso outra situa o que tem que ser tratada de forma diferenciada
4534922 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4534923 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4534924 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4534925 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4534926 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4534927 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4534928 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4534929 if you look at amds business its been heavily consumer oriented
4534930 i want everybody to have a good time during the olympics i hope everyone can understand china
4534931 i feel very proud today because this is the match when japan will surrender
4534932 that the market seems to do better when barack obama is having problems
4534933 their support comes even as obama seeks higher taxes for wealthy americans

4534935 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4534936 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4534937 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4534938 now people are realizing that the problems arent limited to the u s in some places they might even be worse
4534939 the usds upward momentum is developing freight train like qualities shredding those who attempt to fade the move but rewarding those on board
4534940 primarily the notion that the rest of the world is finally following the u s down the tubes
4534941 we have seen the lows of this multiyear cycle but i dont see the dollar going on a long bull run at this point
4534942 the cornerstone of technical analysis is that history repeats itself
4534943 in that case this could be the start of the bull run that leads us up to a strong point at the end of the decade

4535019 the old john mccain used to boast about honorable politics while the new john mccain finds roveian smears funny honor is not a laughing matter what does john mccain think is funny about an intolerant smear artist who called pope john paul ii senile and claims the government lied about 9 11 mccain has said he wants to run an honorable campaign but his belief that these smears are funny makes people question whether he now approves of the same reprehensible politics used to smear his own character eight years ago

4535022 id estimate that i see the 3g icon on the phone less than one third of the time in so called 3g areas that i frequent in the bay area and austin texas
4535023 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4535024 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
4535025 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible
4535026 apple has had the same problem in every market where the 3g iphone is sold

4535069 i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4535070 hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that theys why its disappointing because he is a great player i cant take anything away from the fact he won the match
4535071 we were on the court like 2 1 2 hours i was really tired i didnt feel anything

4535076 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4535077 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4535078 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4535079 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4535080 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence

4535083 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4535084 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4535085 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4535086 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4535087 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4535088 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion

4535096 the last thing any organization wants to do is lay off employees

4535147 the bill should get the support of oil patch democrats or those from petroleum producing states plus the backing of some democrats who have previously voted against new offshore drilling it includes measures aimed at attracting more democratic support such as funding for such party priorities as development of alternative fuels like solar and wind power and energy assistance to low income households

4535159 telling a late person just to be on time is a little like telling a dieter to simply stop eating so much
4535160 repetitive lateness is more often related to personality characteristics such as anxiety or a penchant for thrill seeking
4535161 some people are drawn to the adrenaline rush of that last minute sprint to the finish line while others receive an ego boost from over scheduling and filling each moment with activity
4535162 people who are late tend to misjudge the time needed to accomplish even those things theyve done hundreds of times like getting dressed for work
4535163 youre creating a reputation for yourself and its not the best reputation to be establishing people feel they cant trust you or rely on you
4535164 if youre always late by a different amount of time five minutes sometimes 15 or even 40 minutes other times it is likely that the cause is technical that means you are not good at estimating how long things take

4535175 right now tropic thunder is considered a much bigger title because of the actors in it everything weve seen so far predicts that it will be number one at the box office this weekend with star wars the clone wars at number two
4535176 if this was a live action movie i can assure you that it would have been a box office giant
4535177 this movie looks like a great video game with a lot of action to it but that definitely makes it different than what star wars fans are used to

4535254 i always wanted to do a fictional giant motorcycle a huge bike that looks like it weighs 800 to 1000 lbs the animated batman series had some bikes designed like this and i thought they looked pretty cool the front end is supposed to resemble a freight train to try to give it some mass the full body fairing doesnt come lower than the lowest foot pegs which have been transformed into running boards like on the side of a truck the idea was inspired by the full body cover they use on landspeed bikes i was actually kind of surprised how tightly those things can turn at low speeds although they probably cant corner at racing speeds this bike was designed to be a long range freeway cruiser the cover very long distances at high speeds 75 120 mph and do so comfortably the engine alone is indian but the rest of the bike is original design i didnt want to give it a fancy paintjob because im far more fascinated by utilitarian vehicles rather than flashy show bikes give me a german ural above an orange county bike any day

4535269 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4535270 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4535271 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4535272 i really love the self sufficiency of it that i know where the produce started and what the process is
4535273 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4535274 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4535275 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4535276 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4535277 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4535278 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future

4535284 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4535285 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4535286 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4535287 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country
4535288 oh i see the case number isnt a valid one the number for this is much higher than any numbers we use
4535289 according to legend if you make a wish and fold one thousand paper cranes the wish will come true
4535290 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

4535294 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4535295 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4535296 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4535297 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4535298 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4535299 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4535300 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4535301 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4535302 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4535303 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4535304 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4535305 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4535306 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4535307 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4535308 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4535309 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4535310 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4535311 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4535312 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
4535313 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
4535314 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
4535315 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4535316 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4535318 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year

4535337 months ago liberal democrats heavily criticized the torys poor parking policy and we called in the decision the cabinet member finally agreed to look at the issue of evening parking charges in bath but weeks and weeks on he has still not made his mind up
4535338 suddenly residents in keynsham are unhappy with a policy and he leaps to change it but why only in his town
4535339 cllr gerrish says there is not sufficient off street parking in keynsham does he really think that there is in bath the decision just to remove the increased blue badge charges from keynsham is a slap in the face to the people of bath
4535340 i will be writing to cllr gerrish to question this decision

4535346 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4535347 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4535348 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4535349 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4535350 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4535351 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4535352 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4535376 uit deze lijst blijkt dat een deel van de politici mandaten cumuleren
4535377 zo zijn burgemeesters uit middelgrote en grote steden in sommige gevallen ook parlementslid nochtans betreffen dit twee voltijdse mandaten die beide een behoorlijke tijdsinvestering vergen
4535378 het is praktisch onmogelijk om verschillende mandaten tegelijkertijd goed uit te oefenen politici met een verkozen mandaat moeten hun verantwoordelijkheden nakomen ten aanzien van hun kiezers
4535379 uitvoerende mandatarissen in steden of gemeentes met meer dan 30 000 inwoners mogen niet langer cumuleren met een parlementair mandaat

4535451 we let you handle capture retention archiving and content management to manage your content proactively because the information has already been retained classified and managed
4535452 they are expensive because organizations often have to expand them to deal with other cases and typically these solutions dont address the bigger problem of information retention

4535459 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4535467 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible

4535469 iran just wants to use turkey as a transit country but turkey wants to be a partner iran is concerned about turkey becoming an energy hub
4535470 most importantly ahmadinejad has come to win some time for iran internationally in the nuclear talks
4535471 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4535472 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4535473 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4535474 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4535475 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4535476 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4535477 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4535478 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
4535479 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4535480 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4535481 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4535482 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4535483 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4535484 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4535485 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4535486 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4535487 free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
4535488 until recently most retailers had been selling two litres for around 40 50p more than these latest prices and i believe this has sparked fears that iceland lidl aldi and other discounters will also drop their prices
4535489 with soaring costs of this nature an increase in farm gate prices are essential to stem the flow of milk producers leaving the industry
4535490 such an increase has to be significant but that will be very difficult to achieve if milk becomes the subject of a prolonged price war
4535491 in the current economic climate customers are telling us they want a range of products which will help to ease some the financial pressure they are facing
4535492 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4535493 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4535494 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4535495 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4535496 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4535497 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4535498 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4535499 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4535500 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4535501 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty

4535507 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4535508 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4535509 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4535510 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4535511 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4535512 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4535513 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4535514 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4535515 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4535516 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4535517 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4535518 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4535519 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4535520 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4535521 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4535522 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4535523 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries

4535544 karl rove and haley barbour decided they were going to have a mississippi makeover
4535545 so they went after the man who was the well for democratic funding in the state they saw paul minor as a threat and they wanted to cut off his funding and the prosecution had the desired effect contributions to the democratic party dropped off 75 percent in mississippi from one election to the next
4535546 yeah and maybe a shirt too but you know with the confederate flag on it
4535547 they can come back to court and do this all over again

4535553 they are a pretty athletic team we are just going to worry about our own team and on our players and go from there

4535564 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4535565 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4535566 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u
4535567 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4535568 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

4535570 the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4535571 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4535572 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus
4535573 it sends a signal to moscow that people are not going to be intimidated
4535574 it is this kind of agreement not the differences between the us and russia over south ossetia which could lead to a real rise in the tension in russian american relations
4535575 poland by deploying the missiles is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4535576 the threats from russia create unease i take them very seriously
4535577 poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4535578 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4535579 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4535580 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4535581 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4535582 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4535583 but in order to get to that point there really does have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests are not protected
4535584 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4535585 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4535586 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4535587 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4535588 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4535589 it can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of polish russian talks this agreement can be seen as a purely anti russian agreement
4535590 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4535591 we need 1 500 units a day to make up the deficit
4535592 how did you find your way to the pool theres no way you could have gotten here the lights were off
4535593 we have made progress but we will need your support to get the job done for the fundamental change in our political system
4535594 about is about getting the philippines back in the world map and putting the filipino people on the road to peace and prosperity permanently
4535595 we have to take the opportunity within a reasonable time frame because this is a long deliberate process that involves our future if we place this in the backburner for too long it could burn out and be lost forever
4535596 once we have proved to our people that we have done what we can within the present structure of government we can move on to changing the system to one that enhances our freedom and flexibility to do more i expect that next year congress will start considering the resolutions for charter change
4535597 the other message to send is that we will address the burden that the other philippine story imposes i refer to the story of how our political system has now become a hindrance to our national progress over the years our political system has degenerated to the extent that it is difficult for anyone to make any headway yet keep his hands clean to be sure the system is still capable of achieving great reforms but by and large our political system has betrayed its promise to each new generation of filipinos not a few of who are voting with their feet going abroad and leaving that system behind perhaps we politicians have done our best but maybe our best is not enough given the present system perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit it is time to turn to the people bring them into government and change the way that government is done the system clearly needs fundamental change and the sooner the better its time to start the great debate on charter change the mode of charter change is the exclusive prerogative of congress but a constituent assembly may well give our people the quickest reform
4535598 we have three fronts of struggle first the economy we must sustain our gains second charter change we must achieve this by the middle of this year third is poverty we must bring relief to the people battered by high oil prices and unemployment
4535599 i shall be at the helm of both the economy and pump priming program for social equity while congress and the local governments shall push the pincer attack on charter change gathering force behind the mandate of the people
4535600 tough decisions are also in the offing as we take up proposals for charter change i trust and hope that each sincere thought shall pour out of this gathering with the paramount interest of the people in mind we need to talk about charter change or the pace of the world could overwhelm us the time is now and i must stress this even if it invites controversy because im aware that we are a gathering of statespersons despite our disagreements we can only mold consensus from challenge and ferment in the marketplace of ideas
4535601 this is democracy in action and we must uphold it i extol those who fought for the peoples initiative for their patriotism perseverance and courage the great idea of charter reform lives on and we must keep the fire burning this is about creating a modern working philippines to leave behind the degenerated system that is holding the nation back and keeping it too poor and too divided
4535602 we have a vision of having the philippines join the ranks of first world nations by 2020 and a modern more cohesive and more accountable political structure is key to achieving that goal we leave it now to the concerned institutions as to how we can keep the dreams of the people ascendant and heed the imperatives of change
4535603 because if it is struck down the government is going to lose face will the other side milf still believe them
4535604 what if the sc strikes down the moa there will no longer be a peace process if there is no peace process what will we have
4535605 what were seeing now is the difficulty of moving forward if the court strikes it down its not a simple problem
4535606 the thing is its a negotiation you agreed when you talk about renegotiation after a strike by sc there will be many psychological elements that includes loss of face
4535607 im sure well talk about how we can move forward
4535608 whats clear is we cannot stop the negotiations thats how important peace is nagkakagulo na nga uli e
4535609 gma is not the problem because during the time of fvr the issues raised were the same

4535611 the trigger in 1996 was the spcpd southern philippines council for peace and development the trigger in 1988 was moslem mindanao
4535612 you cross the bridge in these formal negotiations both sides and you be a bridge within civil society level we need bridges of peace and media can play that role

4535621 this paper will attend to the mystic operation where the aesthetic and ethical gestures collide as michel de certeau puts it by way of analogy i will place stanislas bretons analysis of the fools of the cross in the register of vladimir jank l vitchs casting of music as a kind of silence which is at once the attenuation of the logos both gestures signal a forestalling of rational discourse by the insinuation of an ineffable passage a divine music wherein loquacity and long winded discourse are themselves silenced by this very interrupting and enchanting silent music but which at the same time spills out into a panoply of practices expressing not meaning but an inexpressible elsewhere thus will i tie together the poetics of bretons fools who radiate only the beauty of that to which they have themselves become attracted the cross of christ and the passing breeze of jank l vitchs silent music this paper is then but a gesture centralized around st pauls comment that the one who wishes to be wise must first become a fool 1 cor 3 18 only i will here suggest that the poetics of bretons fools and for the very reason that the cross to which they give their allegiance is foolishness to the wisdom of this world precisely is the charm of an enchanting melody the furtive passage of the divine on tiptoe exactly contrary to an athenian ethical prohibition on the kind of music which enchants and which inscribes the authority of the state as arbiter of musics limits and even its performers the audible silence of musics charm just is the foolish ethical gesture to which the cross beckons its followers

4536001 kalau memang dalam promosinya astro menyebutkan akan menyiarkan itu liga inggris selama tiga musim kompetisi tapi pada kenyataannya hanya satu tahun ylki memandang hal itu tidak benar

4536033 on friday kaspersky told computerworld that he has been communicating with intel about the flaws for nearly a month and the company has told him that it fixed the two critical flaws he brought to intels attention both of the flaws one in the cache controller and one in the arithmetic logic unit could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code according to kaspersky

4536036 who are we as men to say to janice and these other women that we are called but not you
4536037 this is a big issue for me i feel we are tampering with the sacred that we are in a way overwriting gods call who are we to say that our call as men is valid your call as women is not valid
4536038 ive come to the realization that women could be ordained in our catholic church
4536039 but i do believe in this issue enough that i cannot be silent
4536040 they were not consulted prior to his participation nor would they have condoned it
4536041 it was the general council that has asked him to come back as one of their brother priests to understand from him the facts behind his thinking
4536042 this is an issue that could lead the church forward
4536043 whether there is a will for the anglican communion to go forward together in our lords service
4536044 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
4536045 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
4536046 some defined relationship with a separated and more liberal communion of churches centred on the episcopal church
4536047 the thing that shocked me most while at gafcon was just how angry some of the african bishops are
4536048 bishop scott joynt is rapidly moving into a position where he will be regarded as an extremist the fact is he is an absolute centralist

4536054 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4536055 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4536056 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4536057 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4536058 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4536059 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4536060 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4536061 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers

4536070 the presidential spokesman has termed as totally baseless and malicious the recent spate of unsubstantiated news reports and rumors being spread that president pervez musharraf was resigning
4536071 impeachment means disgrace and the army would not like to see their institution humiliated
4536072 my information is that the impeachment vote will not take place
4536073 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4536074 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4536075 during the past month call open interest which is the number of open call position contracts to buy watson stock has increased 77 percent so that tells us theres a rising litany of bulls on watson pharmaceuticals and this is going to be an interesting stock to watch even though theres not a specific rumor right now

4536122 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4536123 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4536124 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4536125 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4536126 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4536127 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4536128 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4536129 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4536130 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4536148 at no time were the palestinians presented with a detailed set of proposals by prime minister ehud olmert or any israeli official
4536149 all the details mentioned in this report are either completely untrue or are not linked to reality
4536150 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
4536151 the era of partial agreements and phased tactics has gone
4536152 the talks with israel are continuing despite the wide gap between the two sides
4536153 so israels security and sovereignty was saved once again by the palestinians
4536154 its outrageous that a man in olmerts position presented such a proposal
4536155 do you know the funny part were perfect happily before we decide happilyn ever after
4536156 oh anni shes just one of the biggest trainwrecks in seattle
4536157 the convention is a huge reason why larimer square wanted to complete the package for the tourists coming in
4536158 they want to offer them an option for a nightclub
4536159 thats our focus the clubs in denver have been unable to deliver such a product in comparison to l a and in comparison to las vegas
4536160 we offer a special experience that people expect throughout the process from the time they get approached by our vip hostesses to the follow up approach that we have
4536161 you cant open it in a mall in aurora or lakewood
4536162 its a different price range in terms of the bottle service
4536163 the products were going to be offering here we have additional things that will justify why its more expensive fresh juices instead of pop being in big pitchers it will be in individual bottles well be offering assorted chocolates and strawberries
4536164 and with that theres a huge need for a responsible upscale sophisticated night life concept that doesnt end at 10 or 11
4536165 thats how i get inspired traveling around and seeing how things are
4536166 i feel that people are ready for that right now
4536167 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4536168 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4536169 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4536170 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4536171 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4536172 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4536173 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4536174 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4536175 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4536176 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4536177 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4536178 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4536179 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4536180 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4536181 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4536182 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4536183 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4536184 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4536185 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4536186 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4536187 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4536188 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4536189 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4536190 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4536191 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4536192 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4536193 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4536194 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4536195 sono terrorizzato da te e vorrei che mi lasciassi stare

4536226 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4536227 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4536228 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4536229 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4536230 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4536231 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4536232 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4536233 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4536234 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4536235 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4536236 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4536237 this is a planning took where all things are going
4536238 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4536239 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4536240 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4536241 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4536242 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4536243 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4536244 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4536245 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4536246 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4536247 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4536248 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4536249 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4536250 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4536251 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4536252 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4536253 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4536254 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4536255 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4536256 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4536257 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4536258 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4536259 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4536260 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4536261 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4536262 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4536263 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4536264 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4536265 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4536266 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4536267 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4536268 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4536269 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4536270 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4536271 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4536272 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4536273 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4536274 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4536275 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4536276 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4536277 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4536278 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4536279 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4536280 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4536281 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4536282 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4536283 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4536284 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4536285 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4536286 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4536287 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4536288 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4536289 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4536290 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4536291 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4536292 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4536293 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4536294 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4536295 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4536296 i know i bought the game i bought it at 8 14pm got home at 8 25pm and checked my bank account at 8 30pm it cleared my bank account at 10 30pm that night
4536297 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4536298 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4536299 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4536300 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4536301 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4536302 all my friends know me as a batman fanatic so no one is too surprised
4536303 when youre a batman fan the experience of seeing a good film that speaks to what the character is about is what makes you want to keep going back
4536304 its not simply a spectacle or a comic book fantasia its a real movie too
4536305 trust me im a busy person i could be teaching a class tonight
4536306 people are returning to see it because they want to savor the performances
4536307 its not because the box office is full of stuff they dont want to see its just that the dark knight is the no 1 choice
4536308 we are seeing quite a few people who have already come to see it
4536309 the way the dvds come out now you generally have four to six weeks to see a movie before its gone
4536310 it has held up very well for the type of movie it is
4536311 the tendency with summer blockbusters is the bigger they are the harder they fall
4536312 each time ive gone to see it ive caught a little something different
4536313 right now tropic thunder is considered a much bigger title because of the actors in it everything weve seen so far predicts that it will be number one at the box office this weekend with star wars the clone wars at number two
4536314 if this was a live action movie i can assure you that it would have been a box office giant
4536315 this movie looks like a great video game with a lot of action to it but that definitely makes it different than what star wars fans are used to
4536316 well have to wait to see how die hard fans respond this animated film has tremendous growth potential its refreshing the franchise and making it younger thats a great marketing move
4536317 this movie could be a big surprise and make more money than anyone has anticipated
4536318 star wars is a huge brand with a strong worldwide following that alone allows the people behind the franchise to be totally creative and get away with it
4536319 fans will appreciate that after six star wars movies this is something totally different
4536320 we have definitely seen a lift in the star wars franchise since the ad campaign for the clone wars began
4536321 whenever a sequel or prequel is about to be released that generates a lot of activity in dvd sales catalogue rentals usually triple in a situation like this
4536322 this is a question that is being tackled by several federations not just gymnastics
4536323 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation how to prove that is very difficult
4536324 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4536325 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4536326 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4536327 we went to the school today where these girls lived trained and studied the school was adamant that nothing had been forged
4536328 they wouldnt us the school documents however to prove it unequivocally they just summed it up by saying asian girls are smaller
4536329 ljungqvist said he had no reason to believe the chinese had manipulated the passports or any other document showing proof of age
4536330 we only have preliminary data so we dont know how things will go over the long term but at least one author has indicated that his books are selling better for the iphone than the kindle
4536331 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4536332 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the cease fire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
4536333 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4536334 right now tropic thunder is considered a much bigger title because of the actors in it everything weve seen so far predicts that it will be number one at the box office this weekend with star wars the clone wars at number two
4536335 if this was a live action movie i can assure you that it would have been a box office giant
4536336 this movie looks like a great video game with a lot of action to it but that definitely makes it different than what star wars fans are used to
4536337 well have to wait to see how die hard fans respond this animated film has tremendous growth potential its refreshing the franchise and making it younger thats a great marketing move
4536338 this movie could be a big surprise and make more money than anyone has anticipated
4536339 star wars is a huge brand with a strong worldwide following that alone allows the people behind the franchise to be totally creative and get away with it
4536340 fans will appreciate that after six star wars movies this is something totally different
4536341 we have definitely seen a lift in the star wars franchise since the ad campaign for the clone wars began
4536342 whenever a sequel or prequel is about to be released that generates a lot of activity in dvd sales catalogue rentals usually triple in a situation like this
4536343 nunca en la historia de la rep blica hab a existido un proceso de tanta trascendencia pol tica nadie se esperaba una investigaci n de esta magnitud
4536344 esta es una estrategia si no me puedo defender desprestigio al juez formo un nido de v boras y pesco en r o revuelto
4536345 how can this person honestly believe this about themselves how do they sleep at night
4536346 it was a white lie so im still an honest person
4536347 hang on a sec my dad has to check his blood
4536348 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4536349 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared toward qualifying
4536350 i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland at the johnnie walker championship and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it
4536351 shes such a pro she has had really bad heat rash she has really sensitive skin so i could use no leg on her because she wasnt 100 percent comfortable i have a great team behind me to help her out and she amazes me with what a great competitor she is
4536352 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
4536353 this iconic stadium is one of the worlds new wonders it was a fitting setting for an amazing opening ceremony i look forward to an equally exciting and unforgettable 16 days
4536354 opening ceremonies have always been a way for host cities to welcome the world and for the world to gather and share the olympic spirit this ceremony to open the beijing olympic games was a breathtaking culmination of seven years of planning and preparation the world will remember this for a long time
4536355 al di l delle polemiche i primi risultati dellimpiego di 3mila militari nelle citt amp a
4536356 ill take some nachos three cokes two beers and the hotdogs please
4536357 what do you mean no water fountains at the new stadium okay ill take a bottle of water
4536358 well the five ounce bottle costs 9 50 but you get a special with a the 12 ounce bottle its only 12 dollars
4536359 first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
4536360 first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold w
4536361 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4536362 scheunemanns work as a lobbyists poses valid questions about mccains judgement in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interest of other nations
4536363 so one must ask whether mccain is getting dis interested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4536364 john mccains top foreign policy adviser randall scheunemann lobbied for the nation of georgia for four years including for about a year after he joined the republican senators presidential campaign staff in early 2007
4536365 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4536366 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4536367 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement
4536368 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achive this
4536369 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4536370 our way of life is obviously so much better than yours adopt it now or else
4536371 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4536372 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4536373 if dhl if something happens its going to be like a ghost town i thought i was doing a good job providing for my family and to have that taken away
4536374 its tough times when its a foreign entity coming in and sucker punching us thats how this felt
4536375 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions
4536376 ive been through crap too ill tell you my story
4536377 i could care less of what youve done in your life i want to stand on my soap box and gripe about it
4536378 made up ways to say youre doing youre job and its the kids genetics thats screwing him up
4536379 as much as i try and feel like i am going upstream instead of being with the current i dont think i am the right friend for linda ive given her chances and it consumes me sometimes when there is so much fight its not worth it sometimes it is better to say goodbye thats my natural stream on this sometimes friendships should carry the same respect as life partnerships in that same respect its best for her and i to not be friends i appreciate your willingness to be a mediator but i see this as a continuous battle help is out of my hands out of our control its sad like spiderman i can only love her from a distance
4536380 ecuador is willing to mediate a settlement between chevron corp and 30 000 amazon jungle dwellers suing the oil company for up to 16 billion in environmental damages
4536381 we will only step in as a facilitator if both sides want us to
4536382 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this companies that have made big investments around the world
4536383 a man actually walked across america and planted apple trees so did he live off of apples alone while he was doing this or did he just carry apples with him and carelessly dropped them along as he walked
4536384 you children actually believe that a man named johnny appleseed packed up his apples and walked across america carelessly dropping them
4536385 or he crapped across america unaware he swallowed seeds and they were planted along the way
4536386 can you imagine a man squatting at the edge of the road wait got to stop here and plant tree
4536387 you mean he ate the apples and pooped across america
4536388 well the animals made the trees spread have you ever noticed youll have an orchard and then all of a sudden somewhere along the country side theres an apple tree out in the middle of no where
4536389 hello friend my name is john and these are my friends miguel and anne
4536390 have one they are the sweetest ripest thing youve ever tasted
4536391 someone gave me an apple for the first time and it was bitter rotten
4536392 if we all stopped at first bad experiences people wouldnt have sex as often ouch
4536393 oh thats all right shes got a point though i suppose i can take my slicker off doesnt look like rain

4536400 well before you drop that apple down mayi try it maybe we arent picking the right apples
4536401 well i have a surprise for you on this one have you ever had ripe blueberries
4536402 oh yes i have my favorite fruit my grandmother always had them every summer
4536403 well then i have a treat for you this one is a blueberry apple youll love the taste taste like the sweetest blueberries youve ever tasted
4536404 mmm wow now thats flavorful its the blueberry without the juicy mess
4536405 now we shouldnt be too hastey to have him try all the flavors
4536406 lets savor the moment bill where did you say you were from
4536407 right off the coast of rhode island im a fisherman been doing it since i was a boy
4536408 oh its in our blood you would think of fifty years of it i would have retired and moved on to something else something about the ocean my crew that i cant get away from
4536409 somewhat reminds me of a picture i seen when i was a child of this apple orchard and
4536410 anne would you like to take a walk with me ive sat too long
4536411 i remember when i first told you miguel i still feel bad about that im sorry
4536412 its done no worries i would have found out sometime down the road i know someone else would have told me and might not have been as gentle
4536413 i think johns better at this then we are i know you were trying anne let john handle it hes seen many others before us im sure hes a pro at this by now its his land i didnt want to be around when he finally understands
4536414 kind of sad you know i guess you cant get attached to everyone you meet
4536415 that could be a good thing anne can you imagine how many people would be hanging around if they did stay as many stories as john has told us its a good thing they dont stay
4536416 why do you suppose they come to john of all the many places they could end up in then again god only knows
4536417 yeah and i happened to screw it up that day for you
4536418 maybe it was suppose to happen that way im still here arent i i come and go as i please and weve made new friends found old ones
4536419 yeah even up here you would think things are different in many ways they are i found my old band teacher the other day and he was much different then i remembered him he wasnt this grungy slothy bastard i remembered him as he was clean cut shavened and had such an uplifting attitude it made me want to be sick but it was him alright looked younger then i remember him we were thirty years apart and to see him look just a few years younger then me is a little disturbing
4536420 i met my grandfather for the first time nothing like how he was in pictures but he was everything my mom had told me and more such a wonderful man hes like john he has a place with fields of wheat and grasslands as far as you can see when i found him there was a small group around him
4536421 im being part of a concert tonight im surprised at the responses weve been getting
4536422 anne look at me did you ever expect to see anyone like me up here i didnt i thought i was going someplace else
4536423 yeah thats neat that john uses that as a tool to let the new people know you are ok and you are in a safe place i made mine taste like peanut butter and jelly one time
4536424 i made the mistake the other day changing myself to look twelve when i met my grandma
4536425 she told me i was being silly in changing myself she knew what i looked like she watched me grow up
4536426 i never thought to change my figure when i found joe i hadnt changed much since he seen me last joe died from leukemia when we were sixteen if they knew we could see anything and their thoughts have such an impact its like the best kept secret and really its not a secret weve known all along
4536427 the reasonable thing is to learn from those who can teach
4536428 learning all you can about what you do is important but caring about people and learning how to serve are the keys to lasting success
4536429 yes but we have blind testing that shows what we offer is a better buy for your dollars
4536430 apples to apples but if it was it seems to me that it would be a choice between
4536431 its in hibernation and its been in hibernation for some time and its probably in decline
4536432 its natural for the prime minister to come here these people died for the country
4536433 the ldp realized that focusing on ideological issues is not a vote winner they saw what happened to abe
4536434 all these bread and butter issues are what they have to focus on
4536435 the thoughts ramblings and wild thoughts of one who walks the walk
4536436 be careful what you wish for the law of attraction explained
4536437 while rushdie in his novel the satanic verses covers much the same ground about aisha as jones does suggesting even that she had a dalliance in the desert the greater issue is that rushdie questioned whether god spoke directly to the prophet muhammad
4536438 rushdie can claim he was raising an existential theological query however impertinent jones book is a mere burlesque
4536439 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4536440 there is now a pincer movement trying to silence critical discussion of islam to one side fanatics threaten to kill you to the other critics call you islamophobic but consistent atheism is not racism on the contrary it treats all people as mature adults who can cope with rational questions when we pulp books out of fear of fundamentalism we are decapitating the most precious freedom we have
4536441 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4536442 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4536443 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4536444 how do you think the russians are feeling about now
4536445 44 do it he was blessed with a deep understanding of u s history which showed him what had worked in analogous situations in the past and the 44
4536446 both presidents roosevelt were great leaders who looked shrewdly into the future to solve key environmental and energy problems tr of course was the father of the united states forest service and oversaw a slew of environmental back then the popular term was conservation initiatives he also worked to sustain a healthier population with bold efforts to improve working conditions and to upgrade the safety of food and medicine and three decades later fdr tackled energy issues he initiated a vast program of energy producing public works including the tennessee valley authority in addition he started up the rural electrification administration which helped assure an equitable distribution of electricity across the u s a those are both great precedents so why should i choose between them
4536447 both tr and fdr saw that this great country would face huge challenges overseas and so it would have to be ready militarily and economically teddy built the great white fleet and sent it steaming around the world in 1907 9 those battleships surely proved valuable in the world war to come and as for franklin after albert einstein wrote to him on august 2 1939 he put in motion the manhattan project which built the a bomb einsteins prescient letter outlining the enormous potential of nuclear fission was written a month before hitler invaded poland and more than two years before pearl harbor but during the course of the war the commander in chief saw the importance of atomic power even as he mobilized the entire nation for conventional weapons production from jeeps to bombers to aircraft carriers fdrs efforts saved america and they saved the world
4536448 and so once again how could i possibly choose between these two great predecessors i want to draw upon their joint legacy all americans should be proud of both of them
4536449 im always ready to help in any way i can ive committed myself to be a public servant
4536450 id take his call now and id take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
4536451 more energy and cheaper energy in return for cleaner energy much cleaner energy
4536452 you cant solve this problem just with conservation and you cant solve it just with production you need both but you need a robust both a vital center both not a mushy both on these issues its unacceptable to have nothing happen because the extremes on both sides block everything and then call that sort of paralysis a compromise thats not compromise thats defeat we need to do better cleaner smarter
4536453 and i think the stakes now are higher even than that this isnt just about jobs and the environment here at home this is about the world balance of power the iranians and the russians and the venezuelans badly behaved as they are have received in effect enormous pay raises because of our collective gluttony for imported oil how can we convince ahmadinejad or putin or chavez that they are on a wrong course when all they see is that their oil and natural gas revenues have tripled in the last couple years
4536454 i want to change that i have been reading a book from a decade or so ago by peter schweizer victory the reagan administrations secret strategy that hastened the collapse of the soviet union and it details how reagan and his team figured out how in effect to economically blockade the soviets driving down oil prices from 40 a barrel when reagan took office to as low as 10 a barrel can you imagine what would happen to russia and iran and venezuela if oil prices fell back down to those levels and what would happen to al qaeda if its wahabi paymasters all went broke

4536474 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4536475 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4536476 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4536488 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4536489 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4536490 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us

4536632 microbiologist claims lone anthrax suspect bruce ivins stalked her for decades
4536633 thats a problem because without such detail it is hard to tell if they specifically ruled out a similar match between the anthrax in the letters and anthrax preparations with the same dna footprint kept at a number of other labs around the country
4536634 the basic methods of genetic analysis are well known why not provide enough detail about their procedure to enable other scientists to tell whether they could actually single out dr ivinss spore preparation as the culprit
4536635 after the anthrax attack dr ivins himself worked directly with the evidence the f b i asked dr ivins to help them with the forensics in the case by analyzing the contents of suspicious letters and he did so for years until the authorities began to suspect that the anthrax spores used in the mailings might have originated from his lab
4536636 dr ivins was asked to analyze the anthrax envelope that was sent to former senator daschles office on oct 9 2001 they found it to be a startlingly refined weapons grade anthrax spore preparation the likes of which had never been seen before by personnel at fort detrick
4536637 it is extremely improbable that this type of preparation could ever have been produced at fort detrick certainly not of the grade and quality found in that envelope

4536742 it chronicles a voyage of discovery and there is the undeniable use of geological science throughout
4536743 vernes characters go through their adventures rather stolidly the accent is placed on their learning rather than their feeling from this approach there has sprung the type of story known today as hard science fiction as opposed to the stories in which action or interaction outweighs knowledge or the discovery of knowledge alone the discovery is more important than development of character vernes people for all their physical participation in exciting action were at heart only spectator reporters while wells were subject to inner stress
4536744 these two very different approaches became a combined foundation in time later writers fused into one pattern both ways of handling futuristic and fantastic material the quests of verne were for the new men who might have been shaped by such knowledge two gifts appearing to differ were really complementary to each other

4536763 part and parcel of the struggle and welcomed it as a progressive idea
4536764 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4536765 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4536766 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4536767 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4536771 the forces must be gradually separated and peacekeepers must come in
4536772 this war clearly shows the economic interests of russia given the oil route
4536773 within the framework of international organisations we must review our relationship with russia review all the basic mechanisms of cooperation

4536777 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
4536778 well i liked the way that we came out here today
4536779 i thought we came out fired up for practice and i thought that some groups really tried to take leadership and we gave great effort we need to practice smarter and stay off the ground but some of that is created because they are trying to impress their coaches and play with good effort we got a lot accomplished this morning it would have been a normal tuesday practice thats what we did how we would conduct a practice we have to get used to that tempo
4536780 theres been a lot been thrown at them but im impressed with the group
4536781 they are competing for spots its a group that has a lot of confidence and understands football pretty well and is very talented
4536782 the first group feels comfortable with each other and we are still rotating grayson in there at guard and hes doing a nice job i think petrus came back and played better in the scrimmage than he has at practice so that was good the second group is still coming around
4536783 the other day tyler wilson had a very good scrimmage he was very impressive with the way he distributed the ball and with his accuracy hes still behind in the understanding of the offense nathan knows the offense better but is not throwing the ball as accurately as he did all spring so he needs to come out and play better tomorrow alex mortensen has been doing a good job each time he has gone in he operates the offense and really understands the running game and has an opportunity to move the team because he gets us out of bad plays

4536791 irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated earlier this week that he was not against the opening of a u s mission

4536806 us president george w bush has approved a cooperation deal with turkey concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy saying that private sector proliferation worries have been addressed the white house has announced
4536807 in my judgment entry into force of the agreement will serve as a strong incentive for turkey to continue its support for nonproliferation objectives and enact future sound nonproliferation policies and practices it will also promote closer political and economic ties with a nato ally and provide the necessary legal framework for us industry to make nuclear exports to turkeys planned civil nuclear sector

4536828 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
4536829 no it was not too ambitious technically it didipio is not difficult to mine and we have maintained development the area still has great potential
4536830 those who have weathered this the best are the large multinational companies some of the smaller companies have suspended work others arent operating at all now
4536831 this is about building capacity going forward and recognising the growth of dairying in southland
4536832 new zealand has looked at it before it is all a matter of timing and priorities and we think the moment is right to have another look
4536833 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow
4536834 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away
4536835 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4536836 he was such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would take him
4536837 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
4536838 it is important that investors send their message to hanover as investors are not getting reasonable answers from hanover at present eufa will give people the chance to have a vote
4536839 it is about our ability to get the property market moving again and start to deal with some of these assets
4536840 i have seen absolutely nothing in my time around the board table that would lead me to believe that the company was managed in a bad way
4536841 you can see its frozen on the outside there are icicles hanging off the rock
4536842 that bodes well for us because when water freezes it expands
4536843 we did manage to dislodge some good chunks of rock which is good
4536844 were still focusing at the bottom of the slip well take that as far as we can running water through the top
4536845 well be working on it for probably a couple of weeks after that time well be asking a geotechnical engineer how unstable it really is
4536846 the councils strong liquidity as well as its ability to adjust rates revenue also support the rating
4536847 further dunedin citys history of significant capital under spending as well as the magnitude of capital expenditure ramp up means there is a strong chance that its net debt to operating level is more likely to be between 90 and 110 rather than its forecast of around 130 of operating level
4536848 however the weather closed in again and the helicopter was forced to return to mt cook
4536849 land search and rescue teams are currently unable to get in to the area due to the avalanche risk
4536850 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4536851 she may face glass ceilings but they will be much more fragile than the ones broken before her and they will be much closer to the sky
4536852 he was an absolute icon the real backbone of new zealand mountaineering and the last person that i thought would have a heart attack a heart attack would have been too scared to go near him
4536853 the best thing about what has happened is that it happened in a place that he really enjoyed near the town he loved in tekapo and at the hut he had built
4536854 he had a lot of experience and confidence and you knew when he made a decision it would be the right one
4536855 it is an incredibly huge loss to new zealand mountaineering it is so sad that he couldnt have a bit more time to kick back a bit not that im sure he would he was still so active

4536871 the idea that a mayor could stop the congestion charge was always false and i always thought that local people wouldnt believe it bury lib dems continue to oppose the congestion charge and the council is now free to continue working hard to get improved public transport for bury without this additional tax
4536872 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic
4536873 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4536874 its vintage coronet peak it doesnt get much better than this today there was an awesome powder day atmosphere everyones carving it up and having a ball
4536875 its such a buzz to look around and see the remarkables coronet peak queenstown and the entire wakatipu basin just blanketed in snow
4536876 the conditions are superb with great snow everywhere at the remarks
4536877 this would have happened during the last 24 hours a result of all the bad weather and heavy snow trampers need to know that entering the track at this point is not possible
4536878 we expect to see a lot of trees laying across tracks as a result of recent snow
4536879 ich seh seine glatze und das ist alles was ich wollte
4536880 its the end of the world as we know it
4536881 in reality also the saddle site does not require the level of engineering required to establish a house on the upper plateau site it has a much higher ability to absorb the change
4536882 what all of this reveals is that there is a lack of balance at the core of the uces submission
4536883 essentially my position on this matter is now similar to the applicants

4536886 the first american died in china more than a week ago five days before the games began twenty five year old ann dewaters of chicago was killed in beijing monday august 4 in an incident that went unannounced and is still unexplained by both u s and chinese authorities and the american relief organization she was working for
4536887 once the councillors go through the workshop next week they may decide to halt projects
4536888 if we race off and make investments assuming there are development contributions which are not forthcoming we would get into debt
4536889 we would get into a situation where we have a 10 million debt and no way to pay back the loan that would be passed on to ratepayers
4536890 it is still not decided yet in terms of what the full development down there will be
4536891 it has been a difficult year in terms of escalating costs
4536892 in the next few months as the remaining issues are resolved
4536893 a key drive behind the plan change is the provision of more cost effective and timely infrastructure for the whole of kingston
4536894 the council has been working closely with the developer to determine likely costs of connecting to sewage and water infrastructure
4536895 it is intended that consultation on the costs and issues around the provision of this infrastructure to the village will be undertaken in parallel with the plan change as this will be an important consideration for the local community
4536896 it is currently intended that consultation with the community on servicing will occur prior to or simultaneously with consultation on the plan change itself
4536897 at this point it is anticipated that this consultation will occur in september october 2008 delivery of this phase of the project may be under pressure due to changes in key staff at lakes engineering
4536898 the biggest thing that impacted on me and made me want to work with orphans was when my brother went to work in an orphanage in romania
4536899 and africa is a country thats always been in my heart i dont know how africa got in there i guess its just been there and i guess its just me i like the personality of the black people
4536900 and child soldiers i want to work with child soldiers i dont know if any particular child in the orphanage i hope to work in will be a child soldier but i imagine theres many in the region who have escaped darfur or uganda
4536901 what he says about the child soldiers is we are dead already we have just watched our families and villages die in front of our eyes we are dead in spirit
4536902 so even if they have not been abducted they take vengeance they have no one left it is their way of having some kind of family
4536903 i guess for me i get frustrated about getting up for nine to five work just so as to get material possessions i have an adventurous spirit i dont have much fear for me i want to make a difference
4536904 i really feel like gods called me to this place
4536905 it makes me feel really excited i know its going to be really hard and really challenging i know i going to see some really horrible stuff but it doesnt worry me i know this is what i am supposed to be doing
4536906 i am thrilled to be announced as a finalist the fact i have got this far is a testament to the fact that what medrecruit is providing for junior doctors is what they need right now namely to have a life and a career
4536907 in particular the proposed activity as it currently stands is not considered to adequately avoid adverse effects or maintain amenity values considering the landscape values of the site and its location within the existing environment
4536908 there are no rules and regulations on how long child witnesses can be questioned for and no rules about how old children have to be to give evidence children of 5 and 6 give evidence in new zealand courts in the us some are as young as 3
4536909 people have got to have access to them or there is no point in having them
4536910 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4536911 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4536912 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4536913 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4536914 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4536915 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4536916 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4536917 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4536918 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4536919 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
4536920 over the years i have been to several crashes where people have hit animals including those where people have been killed or seriously injured
4536921 any time you sneak in on your last throw and squeak out a medal its special i didnt win but i moved from sixth to second and thats something

4536938 he shares in your passion and your dedication you will be well served
4536939 we will do everything in our power at jpra to ensure the services of combat commanders and everyone else has every available tool we have available
4536940 as a result of this year long effort organizations at the federal state and local levels will have better understanding of what goes into coordinated homeland defense as well as effective civil support during crises
4536941 we discover better ways to conduct planning and to support operations we are making recommendations on how organizations can make better decisions quicker and improve our collective response to domestic emergencies
4536942 at this point we are focusing on information sharing we bring all the partners together put them in a simulated disaster situation and use the technologies we have available to provide common situational awareness for all those involved
4536943 when various organizations that need to work together dont have the same information the overall effort to prevent or to recover from a disaster just isnt as strong in this experiment users can access the same data sets regardless of what common operational picture tool they use on their computer or laptop
4536944 with this type of tool conceptually the police precinct chief has the same picture that the governors office and the states national guard headquarters has and vice versa the department of homeland security can see the same thing the governor sees happening in his or her state
4536945 i have had some terrific assignments along the way both artillery and public affairs but i could not think of a better way to cap off my career in the military

4536951 were working an earthquake in indiana and an earthquake in oregon
4536952 then were working a train derailment in the commonwealth of virginia
4536953 they just know that its a massive train derailment and its caused some problems but they have some indications that there may be something more involved thats stimulated the operations center from the virginia fusion center in richmond for the law enforcement aspect of it
4536954 the scenarios are almost unimportant and the reason i say that it because its just a way to stimulate the actual experiment participants into taking the actions needed to measure the performance
4536955 its really important to understand that were not measuring the performance of the exercise participants or evaluate them what where trying to do is use their performance as a yardstick to measure the tools theyre using to perform their duties and see how well the tools enable that
4536956 its important to understand that noble resolve isnt just about developing a tool its about developing a process whereby tools can be used in an integrated manner
4536957 id like to use this tool and have it feed into the next tool what kind of processes can i put in place so that those tools that dont normally talk can interact and absorb information
4536958 the catalogue is sort of a one stop shop for information sharing so folks can make announcements of information requests for information they can share files and even chat rooms that they can go to about certain issues
4536959 its basically a group that is facilitating the brokerage of information so participants have visibility on information requests they know about certain postings and which data products are useful to satisfy those requests helping connect the two players so that information flows
4536960 those are some of different tools that are able to help participants talk together
4536961 we are hoping to get more information on how to provide enhance tools to the warfighter and the emergency responder better prepare mitigated effects from national hazards or man made hazards so we are hoping the kind of input in what we can do provide enhancements to our tools and put them in the warfighters tools
4536962 the communication on what nongovernmental groups need to be more effective in disaster response and how do they communicate with the military
4536963 this is the first of many steps that the military has taken to integrate the nongovernmental organizations perspective
4536964 my first hope is to create pathways to better understand the ecosystem of disaster response and start to address how we can communicate more effectively
4536965 the ready responders network is an unclassified network that facilitates all communication amongst all groups
4536966 i am showing them the experimentation in noble resolve in particular
4536967 spain being much smaller has similar issues we have regions we have the same approach regarding emergencies and that is what this experiment is about we are interested in seeing how you approach sharing information these collaborative tools and also as being the coordinator for this multinational cell
4536968 i also think that this is a very good opportunity to learn about experimentation and not only to engage in with state but other multinational partners that share the same objectives the same interest
4536969 we see that there are gaps in the peacetime process whether they are terrorists attacks or natural catastrophes that the capabilities of the civilian forces are not enough
4536970 we have identified gaps in situational awareness and we have identified gaps which we have to improve we are here to learn and we always want this to be a two way street so maybe we will be able to contribute we have very advanced technical solutions in our maritime area situational areas in coastal area but we are lacking on the land
4536971 we ensure that its a mission that dod can do that its suitable legal and making sure that theres nothing else out there that can do that mission
4536972 we want to be very prudent with dod assets were here to helpm but we want to make sure that its done the right way and that there isnt another asset out there that can be used
4536973 people forget that the national guard is a huge capability in itself
4536974 we will move into the analysis part of this and when youre talking about something like information sharing it is very a dynamic environment well be getting into very tough concrete metrics that will affect everything and thats the way this comes to value
4536975 i expect to come out with some insights that will actually change how dod and the mission partners go about sharing information how we interact with our partners
4536976 even when the tone of the meeting is contentious its a good thing because it allows them to work towards a solution together
4536977 the police have been on the front line and have a very different perspective than the judges
4536978 its sometimes tough for the police to operate under such objective guidelines and policies it is often difficult for them to honor the judges release orders given their primary concerns are for regional security not having the ability or time to gather enough evidence may ultimately lead to release of those individuals they feel are guilty
4536979 five years ago this culture had no respect for the rule of law things have only been stabilized in the past twelve months
4536980 we did not get our first convictions until october 2007 and thats a mere eight months ago when we first started going out to these ip stations we found detainees that had been here more than a year because there was no forum to have the cases adjudicated
4536981 all we can do is be present in an advisory capacity
4536982 they are going to address these issues in a way that they feel is appropriate

4537016 there will be a great sigh of relief in nato circles that khalid will be gone
4537017 the army particularly is whats important because nato diplomats and nato officials have all complained bitterly about the corruption of the afghan police and mr khalid was particularly tied to the police
4537018 perhaps this means a larger role for the afghan army in the kandahar area rather than the police who really have a bad reputation
4537019 if you believe in what you are doing let nothing hold you up in your work much of the best work of the world has been done against seeming impossibilities the thing is to get the work done

4537240 he threw open the hut door and he had two people who had walked in to be with our party
4537241 he greeted them and said good to see you and came back out and just collapsed and thats how sudden it was
4537242 you go from a happy afternoons skiing to someone just not being with you
4537243 hed had a bit of a bug apparently last week
4537244 but the two thumb range was the place he really loved
4537245 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion
4537246 we just threw everything we could at trying to help trying to get support in but unfortunately in weather like that you cant get a helicopter in the snow actually just got worse and worse
4537247 he has seen many of his friends go in horrific accidents but he was a stalwart
4537248 he stood for very high standards on the mountain you always felt very very safe with gottlieb
4537249 he had considerable climbing achievements and hes worked hard for conservation too especially natural quiet and managing helicopter areas and so forth
4537250 hes not anti heli skiing its just a question of managing it in the right areas
4537251 he was prepared to take a stand and he was rock solid in his beliefs

4537254 the last time we had a comparable fall would have been 1991
4537255 it was a little bit better than we were expecting but they are undeniably weak numbers
4537256 these spending volumes are a bit lower than the last forecast the reserve bank published but in july the reserve bank would have done a pretty thorough reassessment of where the economy is going and i doubt this will be very much of a surprise to them
4537257 there was a bit of a rebound in car sales but i dont think that its going to be sustained because car registrations fell in july
4537258 if you thought the roads were looking slightly less congested you were probably right
4537259 and its likely to remain that way well after other parts of the economy start to recover
4537260 even with tax cuts on the way and petrol prices starting to come down a little theres not a great deal of relief on the horizon
4537261 in quarter 3 the risks are certainly skewed to the downside we havent seen the worst of the labour market yet that could have a major bearing on spending in quarter 4
4537262 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4537263 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4537264 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4537265 im not like your fella who likes to talk about the other team all the time i only have a sense for my team and what they are trying to do
4537266 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to be
4537267 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4537268 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4537269 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4537270 i think it is a step up its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity offshore and put it on the field at newlands
4537271 the first few shots i was going well and it was going good everyone was quite happy then the wind picked up
4537272 it was strong one minute and then it would chop and change again and it was really crazy the final slots for shooting
4537273 its frustrating not to get a chance to shoot for a medal but its my first time
4537274 if id got a medal i think it would have almost felt too easy this shows me how much i have to work ahead of the next games
4537275 theres been a lot of children away certainly in our school i saw a report on it this morning and that has been reflected at our school
4537276 people often say to cough into your hands but thats where the bacteria goes and stays you might go and shake your hands with someone and then pass it on to them
4537277 its better to cough into the inside of your elbow if you dont have a tissue readily available and then youre not directly passing it on to others
4537278 the message is the same though you have to be careful and wash your hands using the 20 20 rule 20 seconds washing and 20 seconds drying
4537279 i recommend that children who are sick stay at home so they dont spread it to other children
4537280 that piece was about 1 tonne and the main piece is between 15 000 and 30 000 tonnes

4537283 a little bit of controllability issue in terms of our ability to control the aircraft in the pitch which is the nose up and nose down mode
4537284 seemed under control the pilots knew what they were doing
4537285 anytime a pilot says that somethings not working the way its supposed to then you know you make sure you tighten your seatbelt
4537286 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4537287 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4537288 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4537289 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4537290 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4537291 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4537292 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4537293 hay un aumento en la cantidad de mega ricos a nivel global y ellos tienen muy claro el lugar donde quieren vivir
4537294 e se il mio vicino non me lo vuole prestare gi ieri mi ha salutato appena forse aveva fretta ma forse la fretta era solo un pretesto e ce lha con me e perch io non gli ho fatto nulla lui che si messo in testa qualcosa se qualcuno mi chiedesse un utensile io glielo darei subito e perch lui no come si pu rifiutare al prossimo un cos semplice piacere gente cos rovina lesistenza degli altri e per giunta si immagina che io abbia bisogno di lui solo perch possiede un martello adesso basta
4537295 the bush administration backed by congress republican presidential candidate john mccain and most of the us media also adopted a highly uncritical attitude to both the undemocratic and chauvinistic aspects of the saakashvili administration and its growing resemblance to that of the crazed nationalist leader zviad gamsakhurdia in the early 1990s

4537314 the secret to productivity is letting dead people do your work for you
4537315 it is absolutely inevitable that there will be a catastrophic incident soon in the us involving medical products whether they are drugs or devices
4537316 the manufacturers consciously intervened in fda business with the fdas own acquiescence
4537317 undermining the safeguard that the fda was supposed to be
4537318 was part of a strategy which placed dangerous products on the market

4537320 and every indication that the pharmaceutical companies have no intention of stopping their current deceitful practices
4537321 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
4537322 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and pull weeds and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where this homeless guy hangs out and you can give him the 50 to use toward a new house
4537323 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
4537324 feeling grateful or appreciative of someone or something in your life actually attracts more of the things that you appreciate and value into your life
4537325 develop an attitude of gratitude say think you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you
4537326 sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light
4537327 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
4537328 its time to get on with your life do the things i designed humans to do make love to your spouse have babies raise families plant crops and eat meals be humans this is what i made you to be
4537329 the steps of the godly are directed by the lord he delights in every detail of their lives
4537330 i believe god made me for a purpose but he also made me fast and when i run i feel gods pleasure
4537331 to give up running would be to hold him in contempt
4537332 he certainly knows what we are made of he bears in mind that we are dust
4537333 more than anything else however we want to please him whether in our home here or there
4537334 how much pleasure is god getting out of my life
4537335 the lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who are wise who want to please god

4537342 the democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
4537343 strongly and unequivocally supports roe vs wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4537344 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
4537345 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4537346 i do think that those who diminish the moral elements of the decision arent expressing the full reality of it

4537387 come on over here big boy show me your handsome self
4537388 when you want to pray the the first question is how do i open my closed hands certainly not by a forced decision perhaps you can find your way to prayer by carefully listening to the words of the angel to the frightened shepherds and the women at the tomb dont be afraid
4537389 dont be afraid of the one who wants to enter your most intimate space and invite you to let go of what you are clinging to so anxiously dont be afraid to show your hate bitterness and disappointment to the one who is love and only love even if you know you have little to show dont be afraid to let it be seen
4537390 each time you dare to let go and surrender one of these many fears your hands opens a little and your palms spread out in a gesture of receiving you must be patient of course very patient until your hands are completely open
4537391 a breathing live sound that will remind you of when music was played by bands
4537392 its a catchy tune with a nice simple arrangement and i think the subject matter catches listeners and stays with them because its something they grew up with and have heard of before i mean who doesnt want to be a swashbuckling jedi swinging a light saber around its amazing how these names and mythologies from the star wars movies have become permanently embedded in our culture i believe that it attests to the strength of the concepts behind them
4537393 i think one of the lines in jedi sums it up best
4537394 it goes no time to debate with all the ones that hate wont even try to relate ill find a better way to levitate in other words evil is all around you but you need to rise above it

4537396 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4537397 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4537398 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4537399 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4537400 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
4537401 cause like ive noticed in the past that youve kinda held back about talking about that when theyre around

4537403 look elisha and i are doing this off broadway show and id like you and ma to come
4537404 the thing is you should know that its a gay show
4537405 and the reason why i havent said anything until now was because i was afraid that you might think i was gay

4537412 im astounded that the conspiracy theory advanced by the administration could in fact be true and the evidence does not seem to suggest thats accurate if the war on terror is real then the first thing that would have happened within a matter of weeks after 9 11 would have been wed have closed the borders off you have no national security if your borders are not secure
4537413 at the los angeles meeting of the american scholars symposium one of the main speakers webster tarpley summarized his own views on the events of 9 11
4537414 the most important thing is that the 9 11 myth is the premise and the root of the afghanistan war and the iraq war and the coming attack on iran we must deprive the myths perpetrators of the ability to stampede and manipulate hundreds of millions of people with their cynically planned terrorist events
4537415 9 11 is based on a pack of lies it wasnt misjudgment it was treason
4537416 occams razor would suggest that the outward bends in the perimeter columns were caused by explosions from inside the tower rather than bends caused by airliner impact from outside also supporting this theory is the fact that the uniformly neat ends of the blown perimeter columns are consistent with the linear shaped charges demolition experts use to slice steel as thick as 10 inches the hypothesis of linear shaped charges also explains the perfectly formed crosses found in the rubble crucifix shaped fragments of core column structures as well as the rather neatly shorn steel everywhere
4537417 i know many qualified engineers and scientists have said the wtc collapsed from explosives in fact if you look at the manner in which it fell you have to give their conclusions credibility
4537418 well nobody can prove what happened 9 11 directly because it has been a covert operation and you dont find proof you will find only indications and one of the indications the indication that everything is right with these nineteen people and usama bin laden is that the government is free to show all the prove that is on the table that is on the street that lays on the ground of the world trade center and so on and so on if you have a covert operation the probability is always that the leftover pieces of proof are taken away immediately and a lot of secrecy a band of secrecy has taken over everything and this has happened with 9 11
4537419 ive seen the results of terroristic explosions and so on and no terrorist explosion has ever brought down a building when the ira put something like a thousands tonnes of home made explosives in front of the baltic exchange building in bishopsgate and let off the bomb all the glass came out the building shook a bit but there was no question about the building falling down and it doesnt obey the laws of physics for buildings to fall down in the way the world trade center came down so you have the comparison of the two building 7 compared with the north and south towers coming down and those two things are exactly the same they were demolished

4537426 exploring low correlated asset allocation strategies that may help you manage your investments during a secular bear market
4537427 most investors know that bull markets mean rising prices while a bear markets falling prices can make you want to run for the hills
4537428 but many are not familiar with secular bull and bear markets which can last for many years or decades i want to educate people to help them better prepare for this type of long term market activity
4537429 were all on information overload today especially when it comes to investing every day were bombarded with ads and advice from tv the internet magazines and many other personal sources
4537430 but information is not the same as knowledge you need to tune out the noise and do the research dont let emotions influence your decisions follow a disciplined approach that lets you adapt your strategy to respond to changing environments
4537431 we are delighted to be working with the management of heartland and with top tier private equity sponsor chs the closing of our first transaction out of our new chicago office demonstrates our flexible capital industry knowledge and local market presence

4537434 when classes open august 25 in harrold school buildings will be safer than normal thanks to this decision
4537435 critics of the plan will argue about liability or suggest that the school could have hired a security officer or off duty policeman but we all know that such officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
4537436 gun control extremists despise this kind of common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4537437 but the time has come to challenge their head in the sand philosophy how many lives have been lost on public school and college campuses because of these insane victim disarmament measures how many students and teachers might be alive today if only lawmakers and school officials had acted as responsibly as the harrold administration
4537438 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defense if other security measures at the school fail
4537439 no doubt the school board and mr thweatt will suffer some slings and arrows but if this decision one day saves the life of even one child it will have been worthwhile

4537467 yo fui secuestrado por ese comandante jos luis romero el 15 de octubre de 2003
4537468 desde 1999 empezamos a recibir tanta informaci n que logramos perfilar el modus operandi eran los viernes o s bados por la madrugada en tlalpan en una estaci n de metro conocida como general anaya hacia el estadio azteca entonces establecimos una vigilancia como ong para documentar el delito
4537469 en ese tiempo romero ped a rescates que no llegaban ni a 100 000 pesos unos 10 000 d lares ni duraban m s de tres d as ahora cobran en promedio un mill n 500 000 pesos unos 150 000 d lares y tienen una duraci n de un mes
4537470 it is your fault because your brother learns that from you
4537471 the guy whos on hunger strike for some political cause is still relying on his midbrain dopamine neurons just like a monkey getting a treat
4537472 his brain simply values the cause more than it values dinner
4537473 its clear that you need some way to compare your options even if your options come from very different categories
4537474 you dont have to dig very far before it all comes back to your loins

4537484 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4537485 now rank with overfishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as major global environmental problems
4537486 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4537487 the female orgasm is located in the clitoris and this will take precedence over the vaginal orgasm in the early years of marriage
4537488 sexual passion is the driving force in life in a partnership of equals men desire physical gratification female fulfillment is enhanced by home and children out of that mix comes orgasm
4537489 sexual feeling within the vagina is closely related to muscle tone and can be improved through muscle education and resistive exercise 78 of 123 women complaining explicitly of sexual deficits achieved orgasm following the training
4537490 the vagina is not designed as a pleasure centre and therefore attributions of frigidity based on not reaching vaginal climax as opposed to clitoral climax are a construction of patriarchal masculinity some would say the natural sexual act is irrelevant to womens pleasure but instrumental in womens subordination the location of womens pleasure in the vagina rather than the clitoris is an expression of the way in which sex has been organised solely in the interests of men
4537491 research indicates that perhaps only 10 of women can achieve coital orgasm
4537492 satisfaction was directly connected to sexual assertiveness frequent sex using many techniques and orgasm a woman was significantly less likely to have had an orgasm if she was 16 19 or 50 59 she was significantly more likely to have had an orgasm if she spoke english at home had completed post secondary education had a higher household income and had a managerial professional occupation orgasm was least likely if the only reported practice was vaginal intercourse
4537493 we have a lot of men who say i can have sex but dont want to its not rewarding
4537494 what is the orgasm survey and why do we need it

4537497 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications
4537498 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4537499 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4537500 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with
4537501 bello sapere di aver attorno tante persone che per un motivo o per un altro con te interagiscono nella quotidianit tutto questo mi permette di vivere in maniera ottima soprattutto perch posso contare su tante persone che sono li pronte a dimostrare il loro bene verso di me e la mia famiglia

4537504 some of these guys are getting 250 000 for a gold medal in america its a feeder system for the pros
4537505 any time theres a new system its a challenge to find the way to make it work
4537506 maybe we bring the personal coaches in earlier give them input from the beginning so we dont have that we vs them mentality
4537507 i felt a lot of pressure like wow they took one king warren out of the situation
4537508 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4537509 that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police cooperate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide
4537510 i never loved a man the way i love you
4537511 she detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother
4537512 it showed a side of her that made her very human
4537513 but think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4537514 does he not care about the future of their relationship
4537515 until the end the whole thing didnt seem real to him he didnt think anyone would be interested he didnt think wed get a publisher i dont think he thought that far ahead
4537516 we always thought we were fraternal until we took a dna test
4537517 so while wmg continues to reduce staff and scale back compensation for its employee base its senior management continues to carry on as if the music industry was in its heyday this simply cannot help morale at wmg
4537518 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4537519 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4537520 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4537521 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4537522 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence
4537523 god willing by the middle of 2009 the power crisis on java and bali will begin to be overcome
4537524 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4537525 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4537526 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4537527 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4537528 atrocity of 15th august 1998 was an attack on all of the people of ireland
4537529 as we continue to build a peaceful and a better future it remains an indelible stain on our history that will never be forgotten
4537530 we condemn these attacks which are clearly designed to create tension in the local community
4537531 we are strong supporters of lasting peace in mindanao as a way to achieve development we do not believe that independence for mindanao is appropriate
4537532 be a good deterrent to terrorism good for security and would help spur economic development in mindanao
4537533 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corp of the philippines
4537534 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere
4537535 i am irritated and angry that our government is really willing to open up diplomatic relations while gadhafi is still in power since he is responsible for the murders of american citizens
4537536 i would gladly forego the money to have libya remain on the state sponsored terrorism list so long as gadhafis in power
4537537 i dont think we should be doing this in exchange for libya getting a free ride
4537538 are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4537539 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4537540 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4537541 regional countries are capable to do it we all need to protect the iraqi state
4537542 i have never said iran would move in to iraq when america left the country i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to exit from iraq soon
4537543 this issue was underlined during our talks yesterday natural gas and oil agreements take time because they need investment
4537544 turkey is one of most important routes for iran to transport the iranian gas to europe and officials from our two countries are continuing their negotiations
4537545 blessed are the hearts that can bend they shall never be broken but i wonder if theres no breaking then theres no healing and if theres no healing then theres no learning and if theres no learning then theres no struggle but the struggle is a part of life so must all hearts be broken
4537546 you know its been said that we just dont recognize the significant moments of our lives while theyre happening we grow complacent with ideas or things or people and we take them for granted and its usually not until that thing is about to be taken away from you that youve realized how wrong youve been that you realized how much you need it how much you love it god i love this game

4537554 se equivoca pablo lemus como se equivoc javier guti rrez trevi o cuando dijo que si no voy a controversia sacan su dinero de jalisco d nde est su amor al estado y su deseo de generar empleo a los jaliscienses
4537555 alguien me pregunt recientemente igual que ustedes si estaba inquieta sobre el primer cr dito pero les reitero que me siento halagada de estar en un equipo de trabajo con gente importante como lucero y si ella lo tiene no me molesta para nada al contrario
4537556 ella es una chava que ha crecido en un mundo de enga os sobre todo con las intrigas al lado de b rbara lucero y me emociona mucho hay conflictos e intriga se ir quitando la venda de los ojos me parece que va a tener un crecimiento importante

4537560 son mol culas que podr n ser usadas en prototipos farmac uticos es decir que servir n como base para sintetizar en laboratorio nuevas mol culas que pueden ser utilizadas en medicinas contra ambas enfermedades
4537561 nuestro pr ximo paso ser intentar sintetizar esas mol culas producirlas en laboratorio para desarrollar compuestos an logos sustancias con la misma estructura qu mica pero con peque as modificaciones es decir producir en laboratorio sustancias m s puras con la misma funcionalidad
4537562 el objetivo del laboratorio adolfo lutz es precisamente realizar investigaciones sobre estas enfermedades y el objetivo de nuestro proyecto es estudiar venenos de anfibios para desarrollar nuevos f rmacos contra las mismas
4537563 la medicina b sica para combatir la leishmaniasis sigue siendo el antimonio que fue descubierto en 1912 y que es muy t xico para los pacientes necesitamos medicinas que no perjudiquen tanto al paciente
4537564 contra el mal de chagas s hay una medicina eficaz pero que funciona en la fase aguda de la enfermedad es decir en su comienzo pero m s del 90 por ciento de los casos no es descubierto en esta fase y apenas se diagnostica hasta 30 a os despu s cuando el f rmaco ya no tiene eficacia
4537565 youll have to take dat up width da supervisor i dun know nufin about dat
4537566 youve got thousands of very small companies who sell mobile content and if they have your cell phone number they can start charging you
4537567 is an open secret within the industry but little understood outside of it
4537568 armed with only a cell phone number the mobile content provider can simply provide that number along with an amount to be charged to a billing aggregator such as m qube or mblox
4537569 the aggregator in turn instructs the relevant cellular carrier to add the charge to the bill associated with that cell phone number the charge will then appear on the consumers cell phone bill often with only minimal cryptic identifying information
4537570 that allows this to happen and they have not been able to fix it to date
4537571 we are in a tremendous digital transition the problem we face today is not that we dont want to make all of content digital we do but the economics are not there we are cognizant that when content goes online economics go down but viewership goes up the biggest concern is replacing analog dollars with digital pennies
4537572 advertisers want to be on something where you know what you get and not on something where you could be advertising next to a video of a cat on a skateboard
4537573 the desire to actually put some ideas and thinking in practice the hunger to do more and talk about all of the cool the possibilities less

4537582 we see an increasing trend of consumers willing to trade off and receive advertising to gain more and better mobile content
4537583 successful mobile marketers will meet the challenge offered by consumers by engaging with them in a way that adds value to the mobile user content experience
4537584 downloadable applications add value that consumers cant easily find elsewhere
4537585 tie to a brand benefit tapping into why you own the phone
4537586 placing banner ads on mobile sites is just a media placement compared to downloading applications that consumers want and allow them to interact with the brand on the go
4537587 peoples attitudes wont change overnight but they are looking for a reason to be positive
4537588 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4537589 he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed
4537590 i think the risks for growth have increased and the risks for inflation remain elevated and a concern
4537591 even though i think the current 2 funds rate is accommodative it is not especially stimulative
4537592 this is because the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than typically would be the case
4537593 continued organic growth and margin improvement may be hard to come by
4537594 macroeconomic conditions remained weak throughout the quarter and the selling environment particularly as we moved into the back to school selling period was tough
4537595 i was very nervous and i needed something to calm me down and i listen to the harry potter books because your mind goes off to a magical world and its great because i was able to keep my nerves in control

4537640 this identification by aim and others hasnt been disputed by the media which has desperately tried to ignore the obama davis relationship but the obama campaign has not responded to it until now
4537641 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member can only add to growing public concern about obamas relationship with a communist pawn of moscow who was the subject of security investigations by the fbi and various congressional committees which examined soviet activities in the u s
4537642 it is clear that corsi is to obama what the national enquirer is to admitted adulterer and liar john edwards the enquirer exposed edwards secret life when the rest of the media were refusing to investigate the candidate and making fun of the enquirer

4537710 se trata del triste ejemplo de la desidia y escaso inter s municipal por la conservaci n de unos espacios vecinales ampliamente demandados
4537711 se olviden que las nuevas infraestructuras hay que conservarlas para que los vecinos puedan disfrutarlas
4537712 la maleza se ha adue ado de los espacios y est invadiendo el mobiliario urbano existen numerosas zonas sin c sped hay vallas de obras provisionales en el suelo y una imagen de abandono totalmente impropio para una ciudad que precisamente est en el punto de mira de los turistas por ser el a o expo

4537716 las propuestas de la che se quedan muy cortas si lo que se quiere es mejorar la calidad ambiental de nuestros r os y racionalizar la gesti n de la cuenca y sus usos

4537719 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4537720 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4537721 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4537722 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign
4537723 now ralph reed has signed up to raise money for john mccain reed has even been appointed to mccains victory 2008 team
4537724 ralph reeds murky connections to jack abramoff run so deep it cost him a race for lt governor in georgia
4537725 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash

4537729 hes in and out of depression but thats expected he wants to be an independent person
4537730 we were planning to retire to florida our lives changed in an instant
4537731 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4537732 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4537733 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4537734 to treat separation anxiety the owner must express leadership towards the dog in a canine way most owners over indulge their dogs whether the dog is dominant or timid the owner provides food shelter entertainment and love but provides no leadership
4537735 for example when you arrive home ignore your dog for the first few minutes then calmly pet him
4537736 talk about kargil what comes to mind is sacrifice valor and courage of our soldiers also there was one woman who literally brought the war front to our homes with the help of the media even as shells and rockets landed around her she was at the scene of action bringing news from the war zone yes we are talking of a well known journalist at the age of 30 she truly belongs to the rare breed of journalists who put their lives at risk to get some of the nations most momentous events right into our living rooms
4537737 we owe a lot to indians who taught us how to count without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made
4537738 land of religions cradle of human race birthplace of human speech grandmother of legend great grandmother of tradition the land that men with intellectual bent desire to see and having seen once even by a glimpse would not give that glimpse for the shows of the rest of the globe combined
4537739 in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagavad gita in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seems puny
4537740 access to the vedas is the greatest privilege this century may claim over all previous centuries
4537741 indian philosophers subtleties make most of the great european philosophers look like schoolboys
4537742 wherever we direct our attention to hindu literature the notion of infinity presents itself
4537743 i owed a magnificent day to the bhagavad gita it was as if an empire spoke to us nothing small or unworthy but large serene consistent the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us
4537744 the indian way of life provides the vision of the natural real way of life
4537745 this makes hinduism the most tolerant religion in the world because its one transcendent god includes all possible gods in fact hinduism is so elastic and so subtle that the most profound methodist and crudest idolater are equally at home with it
4537746 in the history of the world the vedas fill a gap which no literary work in any other language could fill i maintain that to everybody who cares for himself for his ancestors for his intellectual development a study of the vedic literature is indeed indispensable
4537747 in the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the upanishads it has been the solace of my life and it will be the solace of my death they are the product of the highest wisdom
4537748 i am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the ganga astronomy astrology metempsychosis etc
4537749 it is very important to note that some 2 500 years ago at the least pythagoras went from samos to the ganga ganges to learn geometry but he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the brahmins science not been long established in europe
4537750 india has created a special momentum in world history as a country to be searched for knowledge
4537751 it strikes everyone in beginning to form an acquaintance with the treasures of indian literature that a land so rich in intellectual products and those of the profoundest order of thought
4537752 the greeks loved so much indian philosophy that demetrios galianos had even translated the bhagavad gita
4537753 there is no language in the world even greek which has the clarity and the philosophical precision of sanskrit
4537754 india is not only at the origin of everything she is superior in everything intellectually religiously or politically and even the greek heritage seems pale in comparison
4537755 the veda was the most precious gift for which the west had ever been indebted to the east
4537756 the marvel of the bhagavad gita is its truly beautiful revelation of lifes wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion
4537757 india the land of vedas the remarkable works contains not only religious ideas for a perfect life but also facts which science has proved true electricity radium electronics airship all are known to the seers who founded the veda
4537758 the vedic literature opens to us a chapter in what has been called the education of the human race to which we can find no parallel anywhere else
4537759 india the land of vedas the remarkable works contains not only religious ideas for a perfect life but also facts which science has proved true electricity radium electronics airship all are known to the seers who founded the vedas
4537760 the motion of the stars calculated by the hindus before some 4500 years vary not even a single minute from the tables of cassine and meyer used in the 19 th century
4537761 the hindu systems of astronomy are by far the oldest and that from which the egyptians greek romans and even the jews derived from the hindus their knowledge
4537762 how entirely does the upanishad breathe throughout the holy spirit of the vedas how is every one who by a diligent study of its persian latin has become familiar with that incomparable book stirred by that spirit to the very depth of his soul
4537763 religious faith in the case of the hindus has never been allowed to run counter to scientific laws moreover the former is never made a condition for the knowledge they teach but there are always scrupulously careful to take into consideration the possibility that by reason both the agnostic and atheist may attain truth in their own way such tolerance may be surprising to religious believers in the west but it is an integral part of vedantic belief
4537764 the gita the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue
4537765 india has left a deeper mark upon the history the philosophy and the religion of mankind than any other terrestrial unit in the universe
4537766 it was only my first meeting with the indian philosophy that confirmed my vague speculations and seemed at once logical and boundless
4537767 india is the only country that feels like home to me the only country whose airport tarmac i have ever kissed upon landing
4537768 the motion of the stars calculated by the hindus before some 4500 years vary not even a single minute from the tables of cassine and meyer used in the 19 th century
4537769 the hindu systems of astronomy are by far the oldest and that from which the egyptians greek romans and even the jews derived from the hindus their knowledge
4537770 it is india that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by ten symbols each receiving a value of position as well as an absolute value a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit but its very simplicity the great ease which it has lent to all computations puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement the more when we remember that it escaped the genius of archimedes and appollnius two of the greatest men produced by antiquity

4537773 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4537774 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4537775 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4537776 i think the risks for growth have increased and the risks for inflation remain elevated and a concern
4537777 even though i think the current 2 funds rate is accommodative it is not especially stimulative
4537778 this is because the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than typically would be the case
4537779 in those days both my 15 and 16 year old sisters had to work to help the family
4537780 but first i did like all of us in the family did half of our earnings went to mama as our share of expenses
4537781 i have never regretted that family requirement it made us all stronger
4537782 these were the worst of the injured many did not survive but we did what we could
4537783 sometimes we set up hospitals in tents other times in barns or schools one time we lived and worked in an auditorium where we set up the operating area on the stage
4537784 big trucks would sporadically deliver water which we used carefully and cautiously sinks and showers were generally nonexistent i remember we would use our helmets as sinks
4537785 it was the satisfaction of working together with other medical people and being able to help those in need and at times comfort those who were dying that sustained us
4537786 i was there the day it opened and i retired on the day it closed
4537787 ive had a good life sometimes a hard life and ive had many friends i miss my old friends but i know where they are when i want to visit with them i just go to the cemetery
4537788 helping others and making our own sacrifices adds to our own strength and sustains us in later life
4537789 throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail
4537790 as a result millions of our members will receive dvds on saturday in time for some weekend movie enjoyment
4537791 rest assured that we are taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
4537792 its tough to have to see somebody in your family somebody you love and whos been beside you for so long in that position
4537793 right now everythings feeling pretty good but its real early
4537794 for him its a whole different story hes like light years ahead of me when i first got back
4537795 hes changing directions well planting off his leg good so unless he has a setback later in the season i think hell be fine
4537796 i told him when you get hurt youll probably go through a depression phase just not being with the team
4537797 when we travel he had to stay home i told him what he should do is call his family and try to find somebody to hang with while were gone
4537798 we take it one day and just realize that things happen that are out of our control
4537799 you could easily lose your mind through something like this because we dont understand why
4537800 im going to go out and play for him because i know he can hear games he can probably see the games sometimes
4537801 i dont know what hes going through its got to be tough but im definitely something that can make his time easier in there so im going to try to my best for him when im out here
4537802 i wanted nathan not to have to hold his head down for what his brother did
4537803 he has tremendous knowledge and because hes so smart i could put him in my meeting and i could go take a nap and let him run my meeting and it would all get done
4537804 he understands ball playing from the neck up is a part of football not all kids do that he does
4537805 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4537806 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4537807 i will spare you additional details about the tokyo episode giving you time i hope to pour yourself a stiff drink situate yourself comfortably on the couch position a bucket of ice water nearby and strap on some extra absorbent adult diapers to avoid embarrassing emissions
4537808 na jesse owens paavo nurmi en carl lewis is er nu phelps en dat hebben we nodig
4537809 i wouldnt call them drawing lessons but he did teach me the language of comics how to tell a story
4537810 if it had been anyone else i might have been upset
4537811 i kept putting the wrong boots on everybody id put matter eater lads boots on lightning lad i could never keep all the boots straight wed get letters
4537812 marv was being berated by an older writer who shall be nameless it was robert kanigher and he was going on about young kids coming into the industry youre all arrogant you think you know more than we do you want to turn everything into these fannish things that you like to what extent was he right
4537813 im looking for artists who are better than my best artist not my worst
4537814 was dynamic he really knew how to tell a story
4537815 theres a strong possibility that it may be reprinted next year
4537816 im shorter fatter older balder and uglier but on the inside
4537817 its not at all realistic and ive never had any of those adventures but i sure would like to
4537818 i used to look like dreadstar more of my real life is in breed than any other book but my most personal work is the death of captain marvel
4537819 er is met de grootst mogelijke zorg door vier radiologen en twee orthopedisch chirurgen naar gekeken maar op de eerste scans was niets te zien
4537820 i will be patrolling crawford road from 6pm until 9pm
4537821 zien we de duivel vandaag de dag recht in de ogen
4537822 they do not want a commitment or any responsibility if you have a job a house a car then maybe you can find a man who will live with you if you take care of him otherwise forget it it is better to live alone or with a girlfriend all kenya women feel this we are a nation of single mothers and useless men
4537823 if you could afford to live in a certain area then you lived there
4537824 how many africans could have afforded to live in muthaiga or any other white residential area
4537825 this is my time of life to work and earn money i dont want to be distracted i dont want to go out i am lucky and i will never leave kenya who knows what the future might bring all men my age feel the same way if we are lucky enough to have a job and some income we are focusing on that only we will build a new kenya somehow
4537826 registering cataloguing and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications
4537827 we had it so much better there werent congressional committees looking over our shoulder and politics never entered the picture we just did what we must to protect our country
4537828 childs goal never seemed to be perfection only pleasure she stood fearlessly before calories and rich food armed with her wise strategy of moderation eating a little bit of everything to avoid missing anything
4537829 women in the city speaks a similar language as advertising
4537830 but it creates a displacement in the viewers it asks them to think rather than to buy
4537831 the mobile and the watch were both old and cheap worthless really whats gone is gone
4537832 i just cant get my cook to learn anything new
4537833 she does everything i tell her beautifully but she has no initiative at all i say heres the recipe book now find all the recipes for pork and choose one that you would like to cook and tell me what i need to buy for it she looks at me blankly and its just hopeless
4537834 or maybe they are content with a very limited diet and think we are crazy always worrying about new foods
4537835 come on they are employed like anyone else they should have more pride and interest in their jobs
4537836 theyre lucky to have those jobs we take care of them as though they were our own children without us they would be starving on their shambas or living in some nairobi slum on ten shillings a day or losing their goats to the drought in the north
4537837 being shown around a new development project we were in a small village and invited to remain until dark with great pomp and ceremony the village chief plugged a cable into an electric socket and one naked bulb lit up everyone applauded madly and drank beer in celebration and made endless speeches about this wonderful achievement
4537838 what do you mean great achievement i asked youre raving over one light bulb you should be ashamed of yourselves come on youve had forty years of development aid you should have had the whole village lit up by now
4537839 in denmark we have to give 1 7 of our gross national product to aid for developing countries
4537840 because we feel guilty and we feel that we are obligated to help these poorer countries
4537841 why do you feel obligated especially danes you hardly had any colonies what do danes have to do with african
4537842 and we can afford it and of course there are pay offs in trade relations
4537843 let all these people just clear out and let kenyans get on with it they dont need us any more its been forty three years since independence
4537844 you see we are totally involved in developing our karma and gaining good points for darma so we give but it is totally selfish i am telling you worrying about our karmic points really keeps us on the straight and narrow
4537845 they pour their money into schools community projects micro finance they come back and want to give to their country and also to do good
4537846 there are powerful interests that have no intention of allowing kenya to develop
4537847 it came too close to the bone so they are deporting anyone who was associated with it this composer is married to a kenyan has three children and supports umpteen others
4537848 you can bet that some politician covets that bit of business wants to buy into it so they have to remove the competition look they tried to shut down the nakumat chain of supermarkets which are indian owned for the same reason somebody wants that chunk of the pie thats all
4537849 that was such a kind thing to do i really appreciate it thank you thank you
4537850 a teenager who terminates her first pregnancy for example may experience different psychological effects compared to an adult woman who terminates a pregnancy after giving birth to several children
4537851 i said if you dont like seeing people in drag go back to yakima and four of them piled out of the car
4537852 guys started kneeing me in the face and got on me and started punching me and im taking this from the account of my friend because i sort of blacked out at that point
4537853 i have yet to see a windows made product running palm os but a palm made device with windows mobile can still be called a palm treo
4537854 we thought it was important to resolve everything once and for all
4537855 we could have continued to contest this we didnt think that was in anyones interest we wanted to put this behind us
4537856 the fight continues were in it for the long haul
4537857 this is the first time yale ever answered to anyone
4537858 the hospital has shown itself not to be far we were not interested in telegraphing to them the stuff were doing

4537881 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
4537882 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
4537883 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
4537884 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
4537885 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler

4537898 wir k nnen nicht wieder 15 jahre verstreichen lassen ehe hier stabile l sungen gefunden werden
4537899 despu s de una evaluaci n hemos establecido que estas movilizaciones comenzando por la huelga de hambre en santa cruz seguida por el manejo que se est haciendo de algunos hermanos discapacitados y toda esa movilizaci n de algunos trabajadores mineros de huanuni dirigidos por jaime solares es pr cticamente un plan destinado a boicotear y a evitar que este domingo se realice en nuestro pa s el refer ndum revocatorio
4537900 por lo tanto no hay justificativo t cnico ni econ mico para hablar de ausencia de recursos de falta de recursos es una movilizaci n estrictamente partidaria no regional en defensa de intereses particulares
4537901 la actitud perversa ma osa y autoritaria del gobierno nacional de confiscar y centralizar los recursos del idh con el nico fin de truncar el proceso de descentralizaci n y autonom a contrariando el voto soberano expresado en el refer ndum del gas 2004 y de la autonom a departamental 2005 es un hecho simplemente confiscatorio
4537902 los departamentos no han sido perjudicados en un solo centavo en el idh por tanto no hay ning n tipo de confiscaci n
4537903 es bueno establecer estas diferencias conceptuales porque se ha estado especulando yo dir a manipulando la informaci n al interior de los departamentos plante ndoles a su poblaci n que el gobierno nacional se habr a quedado con los recursos que se estar an expropiando o confiscando estos recursos cuando en el fondo lo que ha establecido es un beneficio social es decir el idh se ha traducido en un 30 por ciento para beneficio de las personas mayores de 60 a os de los propios departamentos
4537904 que est yendo en beneficio de las propias regiones se queda en las regiones ya sea en mayor porcentaje a los municipios o en una pol tica social tan importante como la renta dignidad
4537905 entonces el beneficio es mucho mayor a la contribuci n que hacen a este fondo solidario que se ha creado con los recursos de ese 30 por ciento
4537906 son las universidades p blicas las m s favorecidas con estas pol ticas ya que los recursos que reciben crecieron de 72 1 millones de bolivianos en 1994 a 521 millones el 2005 y a 1 956 2 millones de bolivianos el 2008 es decir tuvieron un incremento total de 2 613 por ciento y en la actual gesti n se ha incrementado casi cuatro veces
4537907 quedan as claramente desmentidas las afirmaciones sobre el supuesto perjuicio que este avance social significar a para los recursos subnacionales
4537908 afectar y reducir intereses que han estado cobijados en el viejo estado centralista que ha alimentado estructuras de poder partidocr tico a lo largo de los ltimos 30 40 a os y es eso lo que desapareci
4537909 hay mucha gente afectada grupos privilegiados que han estado siempre como se dec a antes mamando del estado un estado centralista que estaba al servicio del inter s privado y eso es lo que est revertido de manera irreversible por supuesto se est recuperando la dignidad y el rol del estado en la econom a para que beneficie al conjunto del pa s y no que capitalice a peque os grupos de privilegiados
4537910 un proceso de cambio tan profundo requiere sin duda ser alimentado por la ciudadan a y generar un respaldo y una re legitimaci n de este proceso con eso va a contribuir el refer ndum revocatorio frente a la actitud de la oposici n que cree que el presidente no tiene respaldo ciudadano
4537911 algunos prefectos han asumido una actitud de oposici n pol tica m s que administradores de la enorme cantidad de recursos departamentales
4537912 creo que esta es una gran ventana de oportunidad y que el corredor bioce nico tiene una incidencia directa en la econom a y en el dinamismo exportador de iquique las necesidades generan las oportunidades e iquique tiene que prepararse
4537913 obviamente iquique es una gran puerta de entrada hacia el pac fico al asia pac fico y a todo el transporte mar timo que ello implica
4537914 esto debiera traer para la actividad econ mica de iquique un dinamismo de su comercio exterior unido a grandes inversiones en infraestructura que obviamente los transforma en la puerta de entrada para el asia pac fico
4537915 estas cifras demuestran la urgencia de trasladar la mayor cantidad de empresas a alto hospicio ya que iquique nos est quedando chico
4537916 varias de las empresas m s grandes operadores del rubro automotriz quieren irse cuanto antes pero actualmente no estamos preparados para entregar terrenos tan grandes una vez que las empresas se trasladen nocabe duda que los dem s los seguir n
4537917 he venido para decir que los dos gobiernos est n uno al lado del otro y nos hacemos presentes en las victorias del pueblo boliviano
4537918 los pueblos de ir n y bolivia no quieren ser dependientes de otros pa ses esto significa que no quieren obedecer las pol ticas de las potencias como ee uu eso significa que estamos en un frente com n estamos juntos
4537919 bienvenido a las transformaciones profundas democr ticas y sociales en am rica latina la participaci n y presencia del hermano lugo ser importante para seguir avanzando en la reparaci n de tantos da os ocurridos en sudam rica
4537920 es un cambio importante para la regi n porque es la primera vez en 61 a os que cambia de partido pol tico el gobierno en ese pa s
4537921 son carreras que tienen gran demanda y que por consenso solicitaron las comunidades originarias consultadas previamente
4537922 ahora s podemos decir que tenemos el poder del pueblo
4537923 el pueblo siempre puede ser puesto al servicio de sus l deres eso es f cil todo lo que hay que hacer es decirles que est n bajo ataque y denunciar a los pacifistas por su falta de patriotismo
4537924 con la presencia del pueblo derrotamos el oportunismo pol tico que sin escr pulos uni a la derecha conservadora y al masismo totalitario para destruir a esta patria emergente alejada de los privilegios de la verdadera oligarqu a que es el mas
4537925 la restauraci n de los instrumentos no militares del poder estadunidense
4537926 fortalecer nuestras capacidades de usar el poder blando y establecer una mejor integraci n con el poder duro
4537927 el logro del xito militar no es suficiente para vencer sino el desarrollo econ mico la construcci n institucional y el imperio de la ley
4537928 atraer civiles con experiencia en el agro gobernabilidad y otros aspectos del desarrollo
4537929 en una nos abandon porque dijo que ten a compromisos y en la otra nos hizo esperar y finalmente se fue
4537930 por supuesto que el gobierno va a decir que somos nosotros los que estamos trabando el di logo pero as no hay posibilidades de avanzar
4537931 siento que s lo quieren plata no quieren interpretar lo que espera el pueblo boliviano
4537932 el gobierno va a garantizar autonom as para toda bolivia pero en el marco de legalidad y de la constitucionalidad
4537933 lo que siento de manera general es que los prefectos s lo quieren plata y no quieren tocar una cuesti n pol tica
4537934 muestra claramente que existen dos visiones de pa s la mayor a ha optado por la autonom a contra el centralismo
4537935 cumplir con el mandato de nuestro pueblo de concretar las autonom as departamentales aplicando nuestros estatutos
4537936 y seguir siendo as en el futuro por que fue as en el pasado
4537937 agradezco a ecuador en particular que no necesariamente comparte todas nuestras ideas y a colombia que s participa con nosotros en estos procesos de integraci n al mundo el habernos apoyado permanentemente
4537938 es triste porque se opone a todo si ecuador necesita algo tambi n se opone si colombia necesita algo tambi n se opone entonces es una actitud de negar cualquier esfuerzo que hagamos para obtener consenso
4537939 esta medida no solo permitir la implementaci n del tlc con estados unidos sino que tendr efecto sobre la negociaci n que llevamos con la uni n europea
4537940 por los nimos que en estos momentos hay no quisiera adelantar opini n sobre lo que va a pasar
4537941 es triste porque se opone a todo si ecuador necesita algo tambi n se opone si colombia necesita algo igual entonces es una actitud de negar cualquier esfuerzo que hagamos de consenso
4537942 est en contra de la firma de acuerdos de libre comercio ya sea con estados unidos o la uni n europea y ha mantenido su posici n ideol gica hasta el final
4537943 no entiendo bien por qu pide eso pero si lo decide hacer hay un procedimiento de remoci n del secretario general que est regulado
4537944 no menos favorable que el que otorgue a sus propios nacionales
4537945 no se pueden aprobar con el voto negativo de un pa s as sea en la primera la segunda o tercera votaci n
4537946 tomar una decisi n en segunda votaci n aprobada con un voto favorable de la mayor a absoluta y es lo que ocurri ayer
4537947 veremos de qu se trata la denuncia pero el secretario general ha jugado dentro de los c nones y lo digo con toda la tranquilidad de lo que marca la normativa andina
4537948 lo que pasa es que normalmente uno busca los consensos y ayer la verdad era imposible porque ya vamos busc ndolos desde el mes de enero per se ha ido acomodando inclusive modificando los textos a pedido de bolivia y llev bamos los textos que ya se hab an aprobado de manera informal y dec an no no puedo votar
4537949 la posici n era imponer a otros tres pa ses miembros una decisi n particular sobre tres pa ses soberanos que est n en posici n de buscar una soluci n
4537950 cualquier cambio que se haga porque no obedece a los intereses particulares de este pa s termina siendo bloqueado
4537951 no plantea flexibilidad para las negociaciones por ejemplo per quiere llevar un tema que considera fundamental que es la defensa de los conocimientos gen ticos y tradicionales de nuestros pueblos y ellos consideran que esa postura no la podemos llevar
4537952 vemos una enorme falta de inversi n de capital en la regi n
4537953 las petroleras multinacionales no van a poner capital sustancial en riesgo y no pensamos que venezuela tiene la experticia para operar esos proyectos
4537954 pdvsa ha estado prometiendo por cerca de tres a os pero en t rminos de inversi n lo nico que ha hecho es abrir una oficina en la paz
4537955 en lo que respecta a exploraci n y perforaci n no ha hecho nada en absoluto
4537956 estos dos pa ses ser n afectados por el declive de la producci n a menos que puedan ofrecer t rminos m s atractivos que persuadan a petroleras a hacer considerables inversiones
4537957 como dije siempre un arquero necesita jugar en forma consecutiva varios partidos es por eso que considero que estoy con ritmo de competencia pero al margen nosotros debemos pensar en ganar a la paz fc porque necesitamos sumar en este campeonato es por eso que estos d as estamos prepar ndonos adecuadamente espero que el domingo podamos borrar esa mala imagen que dejamos en el partido frente a real potos

4537995 milan bermain bagus di babak pertama dan membuat kami tertekan namun memasuki babak kedua kami menemukan karakter permainan kami dan mampu mengontrol pertandingan dengan penampilan yang baik
4537996 saya kira tak ada masalah di lini pertahanan kami hanya milan memang punya kualitas tinggi dalam menyerang saat mereka mencetak gol kaka gagal dihentikan giorgio chiellini
4537997 awalnya mauro camoranesi memang tampak kurang kompak dengan zdenek grygera maka saya meminta hasan salihamidzic untuk lebih aktif dan membiarkan camoranesi bermain seperti yang dia inginkan dan camoranesi bermain sangat bagus
4537998 tiago tahu bagaimana bermain dan itu tak sulit karena harus menghadapi para gelandang milan yang berkualitas saya bahagia dengan permainannya karena memberi keseimbangan buat tim kami momo sissoko juga tampil bagus bahkan luar biasa
4537999 kami sudah melakukan perjudian minggu ini sekarang kami tinggal berkonsentrasi menghadapi pertandingan berikutnya dan melihat apa yang akan kami raih

4538001 anderson has sought the spotlight in his last months to warn of a growing threat special interest groups sinking millions into judicial elections
4538002 ive learned that the chief justices job is 50 percent deciding cases 50 percent administration and 50 percent pr thats why there are so few math majors that take this job
4538003 where we would close the door look each other in the eye and soberly walk through our options
4538004 we cant allow the next legislative session to be a repeat of the last one we cant sustain further cuts he said
4538005 we need to fund our basic employee costs we have to pay our people what they deserve we have to give them enough help so that they can get the work done our goal in the next legislative session must be to secure the resources needed to perform our constitutionally mandated function
4538006 millions of dollars were spent by special interest groups on ads attacking the candidates as freeing criminals or engaging in political cronyism magnuson said of the april election
4538007 well heeled special interests attempting to manipulate the judicial process are no longer the stuff of fictional thrillers written by john grisham its reality its reality thats right next door

4538025 these findings could not support a conviction for conspiracy the problem with the first finding that he knew the accused men is that the trial judge failed to take this finding to the next step and explicitly find that mr prokofiew was involved in the illegitimate transactions engaged in by some of the other defendants
4538026 there is a similar problem with the second finding that he owned some of the involved businesses it would appear that the trial judge implicitly concluded that mr prokofiews control over the transactions of certain companies found to be involved in the scheme established his involvement in the conspiracy again the difficulty with these findings is that the trial judge failed to distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate transactions of these companies and specifically identify what evidence established mr prokofiews involvement in the illegitimate transactions

4538448 weve experienced tremendous growth in the last year and im thrilled we have assembled a world class team to capitalize on our market position
4538449 the depth and diversity of experience of our leadership team is a huge asset and will help take our business to the next level
4538450 i could hold the epee but if you hit it i couldnt do anything
4538451 the victory is mine too it belongs to all of us
4538452 for me jean michel is an olympic champion just like the others
4538453 they should be equally compensated for the work they put in together for years and years
4538454 its not a grave injury and im happy that stefano could get a medal
4538455 its been said about me i think shalane proved tonight u s running is at the world level
4538456 it goes without saying that we have to do well the footsteps of tulu have to repeat themselves
4538457 i tried to be very concentrated on the game not to be more emotionally involved
4538458 ive been coaching with the u s team for the last four years this is not the first time weve played against china
4538459 every point for our team is very important dont think about the result even if we lose the game every point is important we have to fight for the result
4538460 lang ping is the role model for every chinese female volleyball player
4538461 shes now coaching the u s team and she has helped them improve and change their style
4538462 winning the gold medal is a new start for us
4538463 we are both young and im sure this win will motivate us to go forward
4538464 but even if i had been in perfect shape it would have been tough to beat them
4538465 i didnt do well in the first half of the match
4538466 but i usually win by ippon i was confident i could do it
4538467 i was thinking that i needed to do my best in this match
4538468 i see these matches as a fight to the death
4538469 i knew if i went out there today and hit my routines i would have a good chance
4538470 i just went out there and gave it all i had
4538471 i gave my heart and soul to the competition today but nastia she deserves that gold today
4538472 i think everything happens for a reason and i was destined to get the silver i got what i deserved
4538473 i think both of the girls are the top athletes in the world at the moment
4538474 i can only control what i can control and i think shawn did a great job i told her im so proud of her
4538475 after the jury reversed my second attempt in the clean and jerk my mind set was definitely affected
4538476 but the judgment was made and i couldnt change it it could only use my third attempt to convince everybody
4538477 i knew that the chinese athletes are strong but i didnt expect that theyre that strong
4538478 this very gold medal is dedicated to the people of my motherland
4538479 it is also dedicated to my dear mother who passed away not a long time ago
4538480 do you support bush today more than you did four years ago
4538481 to work to liberate all the islamic states in general and iraq especially from the armies of darkness by which i mean the occupation and colonization
4538482 that is why he froze the activities of the mahdi army
4538483 one time he talks about peaceful resistance and another time he says lets bring the weapons this recent announcement is just an empty one the moktada al sadr issue is finished

4538485 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4538486 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4538487 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her

4538492 two things together highly localized distribution close to the very highest summits and the magnitude of these upslope shifts in response to ongoing warming make a poisonous cocktail for extinction
4538493 i noted this in the field as strange but when i later sat down and looked at the data the trend persisted
4538494 when you see a general trend across all these groups of organisms it is likely to be related to a broad explanation like general temperature warming not something more subtle such as seasonal variation
4538495 the malagasy government is creating important new reserves and protecting forests sadly however with a phenomenon like global warming species will move upslope and so eventually may still lose all their habitat and go extinct
4538496 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4538497 i have repeatedly won gold medals in the world championships but that was nothing for me
4538498 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited

4538514 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4538515 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them

4538519 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4538520 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4538521 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4538522 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here

aujourdhui pour un observateur ext rieur le monde occidental a perdu son courage civique la fois dans son ensemble et singuli rement dans chaque pays dans chaque gouvernement dans chaque pays et bien

comme le signe avant coureur de la fin quand les etats occidentaux modernes se sont form s fut pos comme principe que les gouvernements avaient pour vocation de servir lhomme et que la vie de lhomme

4538697 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4538698 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
4538699 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4538700 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4538701 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4538702 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4538703 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4538704 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4538705 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4538706 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4538707 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4538708 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4538709 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4538710 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4538711 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4538712 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4538713 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4538714 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4538715 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4538716 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4538717 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4538718 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4538719 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4538720 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4538721 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4538722 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4538723 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4538724 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4538725 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4538726 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4538727 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4538728 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4538729 youre going to be finding objects in order to put the trax record store back in order before blane shows up and getting your father ready for work by putting everything he needs together before you send him off
4538730 since we have the option to re approach things a little bit why not give the player that chance to give the game the ending that they wanted to have
4538731 and paramounts just been super through the entire thing theyre letting us have fun with these and trusting us to give the players what they want
4538732 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
4538733 russia has learned the lessons taught by nato in yugoslavia immediately initiating a bombing campaign against georgias air bases and other military facilities
4538734 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
4538735 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
4538736 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
4538737 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
4538738 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
4538739 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
4538740 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
4538741 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
4538742 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
4538743 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
4538744 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
4538745 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
4538746 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
4538747 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
4538748 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
4538749 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
4538750 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
4538751 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
4538752 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
4538753 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
4538754 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
4538755 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
4538756 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
4538757 not only does ad aware free provide a commendable scan time performance it also runs smoothly and doesnt hog too much in the way of system resources

4538760 i wish to have as my epitaph here lies a man who was wise enough to bring into his service men who knew more than he
4538761 the last thing any organization wants to do is lay off employees
4538762 it was one of those things that was a really tough decision to make but the longer you wait the deeper the cuts could have been
4538763 we will be working individually with each employee to make that determination
4538764 alle russischen truppen m ssen jetzt georgien verlassen das ist das wichtigste
4538765 youve got to ask asking is in my opinion the worlds most powerful and neglected secret to success and happiness
4538766 culinary school was easy compared to working with the chef at restaurant million
4538767 i worked there for two years and learned about fine dining and classical french cuisine this experience took everything to a whole different level
4538768 but i learned so much from those guys i was a sponge
4538769 mine was that my personal relationship had turned south and i ended up sleeping on a friends couch then i got a call from a former student at johnson amp wales he asked me to be his sous chef at a hotel in hawaii it was a good time for me it wasnt a career move but it gave me time to set goals for myself
4538770 in three weeks i was promoted to sous chef and one year later to head chef at fairview for breakfast lunch and dinner a year after that the executive chef announced he was giving his notice and leaving for the west i threw my hat in the ring i felt i could do the job
4538771 they gave me the job on a trial basis and after six months the title

4538792 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters

4538801 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4538802 now people are realizing that the problems arent limited to the u s in some places they might even be worse
4538803 the usds upward momentum is developing freight train like qualities shredding those who attempt to fade the move but rewarding those on board
4538804 we have seen the lows of this multiyear cycle but i dont see the dollar going on a long bull run at this point
4538805 the cornerstone of technical analysis is that history repeats itself
4538806 in that case this could be the start of the bull run that leads us up to a strong point at the end of the decade
4538807 toyota and yellowstone national park both share a vision in developing future environmental stewards from the onset to encourage long lasting conservation values
4538808 we are proud to work with yellowstone national park and contribute to educational initiatives which will expand the parks reach to even more communities and groups who have not yet experienced the beauty of yellowstone
4538809 in todays digital age it is essential to encourage young people to get outdoors and connect with nature for the benefit of their personal development and well being
4538810 we focus on teaching students about yellowstones natural and cultural resources to promote stewardship of open space and ecosystems worldwide and are grateful for toyotas contribution in helping us develop future environmental leaders
4538811 toyotas generous support will help yellowstones visitors better appreciate and understand the parks great value to the world thus helping to ensure its protection and preservation for generations to come
4538812 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4538813 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4538814 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4538815 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4538816 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4538817 we will have a very good august as far as expenditures go
4538818 i sent an urgent request to the russian president through official channels to start negotiations to regulate our relations during military actions like those seen at the start of august
4538819 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4538820 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4538821 the verbal assurance that president medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4538822 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4538823 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4538824 it is the position of the united states that that will require international peacekeeping forces that are neutral in the conflict
4538825 would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests were not protected
4538826 there really did have to be important clarifications in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4538827 i think it would be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo
4538828 recognise the territorial integrity of georgia and recognise that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4538829 niet echt nuttig ofzo maar wel leuk om te hebben
4538830 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself

4538833 i dont regret what weve done ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it
4538834 were disappointed life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
4538835 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives

4538841 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4538842 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4538843 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4538844 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4538845 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition

4538849 its quite interesting and my guess with background about what happened in denmark is that the site will gain even more attention over the coming weeks in the media and also get a lot of new visitors
4538850 in effect anthropologists have been studying humans for about a century now and firstly 3000 human cultures seem to be very very different then they start realising that they seemed surprisingly parametric every culture had a language every culture told stories goes through some of the items on the universals list if you look at these you can see our modern internet culture its basically social it enables us to communicate in various ways and so forth basically a story based culture
4538851 whats interesting is to look for things that are not universal that seems to have some importance as well most people have lived and died on this earth for 100 000 years without reading and writing without having deductive maths and model based science goes through non universals list these are a little harder to learn than the ones on the left because we are not directly wired to learn them these things are actually inventions which are difficult to invent and the rise of schools going all the way back to the sumerian and egyptian times came about to start helping children learn some of these things that arent easy to learn it can be argued that if you are trying to be utopian about education what we should be doing is helping the children of the world learn these hard to learn things equal rights is a really good one to help children learn no culture in the world is particularly good at it

4538860 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
4538861 your excessive consumption of alcohol or use of illicit drugs contributed to the attack which caused your injuries
4538862 the compensation agency in northern ireland handles roughly 5 000 claims for criminal injury each year under legislation similar to that in great britain
4538863 each case is dealt with on its individual merits but compensation awards are not reduced solely because an applicant was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs
4538864 no woman is responsible for being raped a man knows what he is doing and it is never the womans fault
4538865 cicas policy is not to make a reduction on a claim for compensation following rape on the basis of alcohol consumption
4538866 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
4538867 we deal with around 60 000 cases each year there may be times when an original decision is wrong this is why we have a review process to allow the applicant to challenge that decision

4538870 im just passing on the latest im hearing that sen joe biden is moving up on the list of potential running mates for presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obama while obamas heart may go towards virginia gov tim kaine his head takes him to a more experienced pick a sen evan bayh or biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee
4538871 rangel surrogates approached obama staffers this week about the possibility of securing him a slot at the podium making the case that it would showcase reconciliation between the nominee and hillary rodham clintons african american supporters but they were told that the 78 year old congressmans support for clinton earned him a place at the end of the line behind barack obamas loyalists even if rangel played a crucial part in prodding clinton to abandon her presidential bid in june

4538876 when id seen this final abc debate in real time id been outraged by its harsh tone it was violent and dehumanizing but it was the culmination of a long process

4538879 it seems the public just wasnt ready to be reminded that barack obama is indeed black
4538880 barack obama met with some ordinary minnesotans the day after his gala 28 500 a plate fundraiser
4538881 the obama campaign is the first to use a long form infomercial during the 2008 presidential campaign
4538882 if you hadnt noticed that may have been because the nearly 30 minute program aired at 1 30 a m aug 10 on ion television the mostly biographical 28 minute 30 second program included scenes of the illinois senators keynote speech to the 2004 democratic national convention as well as scenes from other campaign appearances along with background about mr obama and frequent call in numbers

4538901 the researchers were surprised to find that oxytocin levels rose only in the males whereas it decreased in the females after either kissing or talking while holding hands they concluded that females must require more than a kiss to feel emotionally connected or sexually excited during physical contact

4538934 he was throwing but he wasnt hitting me as much as i was hitting him its the judges the judges saw otherwise
4538935 i called back to the people in the tape room and everybody said it was pure garbage
4538936 i thought i was seeing things he was landing three or four shots to one and wasnt getting no points that first round were sitting there staring at the monitors watching him land watching this kids head go back with two or three punches
4538937 i know the judges are not blind they saw it but for whatever reason they decided not to push his button and that was obvious that was clear there was no doubt about that
4538938 we told williams to punch harder how much more can you do he was hitting this guy with everything body shots head shots hooks
4538939 were not talking about one or two thats human error were talking about at least eight possible points they didnt score
4538940 i wanted to bring home that gold medal but i guess not

4538942 were doing well but there are others many in fact who are getting really nervous and are on the verge of qualifying for welfare
4538943 stifling political expression pressuring influential media and targeting vocal critics and opposition leaders
4538944 he has to remain in prison until the new trial takes place
4538945 how can louisiana continue to imprison a 61 year old man after a federal judge has ruled that he shouldnt have been convicted in the first place
4538946 the state needs to move forward albert must be released
4538947 the mandate for release had been issued and i still remained on death row though i had no more conviction
4538948 i myself had to petition the state district judge and demand the constitution be followed and i be removed from death row some lawyers wont fight for their clients and the client has to fight for themselves like i did
4538949 say you were arrested in 1993 and the statutes mandated that you serve 75 percent of your sentence say the statutes were changed and or new statutes created so that the law mandates inmates serve 85 percent of their sentence by the time your release parole date is near the statutes have been changed again and since you were convicted so long ago and have been incarcerated through several changes in legal statutes no one remembers how the original law worked
4538950 punishment for crimes committed 35 years ago for political beliefs for religious beliefs and for leadership qualities are not legitimate penological interests
4538951 the attorney generals second in command john sinquefield who is helping to preside over the decision to continue fighting the case is implicated in some of the wrongdoings referred to in the magistrates june report
4538952 as a convicted homosexual i always struggled to get basic human rights in texas
4538953 we had 48 government approved beds in the state for sex offenders and thats been cut to 28 so he wont ever get one of those

4538955 he made the statement to me last week that he knows what it feels like to be dead
4538956 if i may be so bold there was another president
4538957 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4538958 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4538959 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4538960 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4538961 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4538962 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4538963 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4538964 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4538965 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4538966 we got some electronics stuff too so that is helping calm things down its just a little bit more aggressive on the throttle which the way im having too ride this bike is actually good at the moment

4538971 to make the arts accessible to everyone and to create spaces inside to give voice to the incarcerated
4538972 i think that the program has been very important to prisoners inside because it gives their lives meaning creative arts are their way to express that which is painful in their lives and also it gives them hope and joy pcap has allowed prisoners the opportunity to express their own humanity for returning prisoners and youth that we work with the linkage program supports their efforts as an artist reentering the community and helps men women and youth find their way home again and be able to stand on their own two feet and even find employment
4538973 aion faq how does flight fit into the aion universe flying is an extension to the overall combat system of aion not only is it an integral part of the gaming experience it will require both strategy and skill to use optimally
4538974 as we look across our country today we see a nation in which millions of people lack the basic necessities of life
4538975 during these tough economic times too many americans are only one job loss health crisis or foreclosure away from poverty
4538976 solely dedicated to proposing a comprehensive plan to address poverty and opportunity in america over the next decade
4538977 if the science were to be honestly used it would be
4538978 it goes without saying that had bush been less stuffed with ideology if he had stuck to the lessons of realpolitik rather than adopting the marks of posturing the world would not be facing its umpteenth conflict
4538979 more troubling over the long term was that the eu saw its task as being mediator its favourite role in the world between georgia and russia rather than an advocate for the victim of aggression
4538980 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
4538981 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
4538982 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy
4538983 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
4538984 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way

4538986 as the united states activated navy ships and the air force to begin an airlift of non specified goods into the former soviet state of georgia and military exercises began in the persian gulf near iran i received communications from certain individuals among the colorado greens who were organizing campaign support events there suggesting that i not participate in an anti war program being organized by other individuals in colorado
4538987 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68
4538988 im a little confused as to the medias portrayal of glenn spagnuolo and the members of re create 68 as violent extremists
4538989 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right
4538990 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68

4538994 you know theyre going to show up here with 14 suitcases when you can fit about one i have two pairs of jeans you learn to live like that its a whole different life
4538995 the reason for destruction of all my relationships is that im passionate about being on the road and making music
4538996 i have great relationships but the women i date dont realize that i spend between six and eight months of my life on the road touring or traveling or seeing family with my daughters
4538997 im pretty honest with the girls i tell them look were dating theres no white picket fence its not like all of a sudden the shows over and the next day were married and that kind of thing

4539003 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4539004 for me its still the best place to play cricket my heart was sore when i wasnt part of the team that beat england at edgbaston but i guess thats a good sign for me because it shows that im very eager to get back

4539007 the authorities in harare should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy

4539009 providing great service to existing patients to get more patients
4539010 it is not uncommon for phase one of a complex to be completed and occupied before building starts on phase two
4539011 these conditions should be linked to fines or penalties for non compliance by the builder penalties could go so far as to allow for the removal of the contractor from the job under pre agreed circumstances
4539012 statistics show that residential complexes are not much safer than traditional suburbs with upmarket complexes suffering similar incidences of crime as upmarket suburbs so one is unlikely to attract lower premiums for living in a complex unless its security is better than usual
4539013 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4539014 but that makes it even more interesting for historians because you have to explain the mistakes as well as the facts
4539015 theres been a very long discussion about the trial what happened who won and to some extent thats still going on today
4539016 the usual interpretation is that this was the great rift between science and religion youve got this arrogant scientist up against a dogmatic church and in that head ramming the popes going to win
4539017 no other historian in the 350 years after the trial has ever proposed the theory
4539018 its interesting to see how people at that time from outside italy are starting to reconstruct galileos life
4539019 even if you disagree with salusburys interpretation it reinforces the idea that people knew there was something deeply political about the whole thing
4539020 in a sense the myth of galileo derives from his early works and biographies theyre part of his canonization
4539021 you have to conclude that at some point the biography became obscured

4539041 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it

4539047 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4539048 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4539049 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4539050 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4539051 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4539052 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4539053 but you have to believe the majority of the people otherwi

4539108 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4539109 the main issue is that the opticians are sort of propagating this kind of fear mongering mentality that its dangerous to buy contact lenses from alternative suppliers
4539110 were just trying to make sure that accurrate information is disseminated
4539111 having delivered more than 200 million pairs of replacement contact lenses to our customers world wide we can proudly say that we have never received a report from a customer identifying any health issue of any kind arising from the products we supplied
4539112 consistent with this we note that no regulatory or professional body has ever identified any actual health or safety issues which they allege arose from the products we have supplied to our customers
4539113 prescription contact lenses may only be fitted dispensed and otherwise furnished to members of the public by a qualified eye care professional
4539114 the successful completion of the warrant incentive program and the sale of a portion of our pbs shares leaves us in a very strong financial position

4539327 i think i went in a little timid just from the standpoint of id never really co written before ive always been the kind of writer that just kinda holed up in a room and wrote something on my own its been actually kind of a really cool experience to be able to pick other peoples brains and attack the song from a different standpoint its allowed me i feel to come up with some of the best material ive ever written

4539331 you listen to bands like aerosmith and you know thats aerosmith you listen to ac dc and you know thats ac dc theres a vibe associated with those bands apart from a sound i mean obviously they have a sound but theres an energy to those bands that no one else has been able to replicate and thats my goal on this record i want to make a record that has my energy and my vibe

4539336 really more than anything for me its just a matter of trying to make yourself accessible i think thats really the trick when you get a crowd of 16 000 people to really become vulnerable in front of all these people and just try to not only entertain them but make them feel as though theyre part of the experience i think coming in with that as a conscious idea is something ive really kind of strived for
4539337 i love it every city has its own kind of stamp every city has its own vibe
4539338 stuff like that the little feathers you can put in your cap along the way is what i love more than anything

4539380 voter fraud is an allegation that my office takes very seriously the only state agency that can investigate potential voter fraud however is the state elections enforcement commission in fact the office of the secretary of the state has consistently instructed local registrars of voters that if they see any voter registration cards that raise red flags or do not look correct they should make photocopies for their own records and send the problematic cards to the state elections enforcement commission for investigation if anyone feels there is enough evidence to warrant an investigation i would urge them to file a complaint with the state elections enforcement commission acorn has informed our office that there were indeed problems with voter registration cards being filled out improperly or incorrectly in bridgeport and in fact those cards were not counted this case proves the system works locally elected registrars of voters are trained statewide to detect discrepancies or inconsistencies in information provided on voter registration cards

4539396 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4539397 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive co operation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive co operation for the future
4539398 liechtenstein has shown in the past eight years that it is prepared to co operate we are ready to adopt european standards
4539399 you have to see the whole question of undeclared money not just as a liechtenstein problem but as an international one
4539400 we saw that liechtenstein was not only becoming increasingly integrated economically but also that the financial world was changing so we had to ask what response should liechtenstein make
4539401 we are in a pre election period so such a proposal is extremely controversial but im convinced its essential to implement this strategy for liechtensteins future
4539402 i can understand that some clients would like to maintain the status quo but in todays world they are well advised to review their arrangements to meet tax compliance in their home countries

4539409 the philippines is fighting a battle against nature that its rice exporting neighbours are spared
4539410 improvements in production technology can play a big role in reducing the problem of rice shortage in the philippines and generally appear to have very high returns that can raise economic growth
4539411 instead of spending a lot of money to import rice the government should us it to support filipino farmers domingo says
4539412 investments for rural infrastructure development and other support services have dwindled from 0 24 percent of the countrys gross value added agriculture gva in 1995 1999 to a mere 0 07 percent in 2000 2005 this is particularly true for irrigation which contributes about 25 percent of rice production increase this meagre investment in the rice sub sector has affected its production performance and weakened its competitive position in the world market vis vis the other southeast asian countries
4539413 there is strong evidence that the returns from investments in research and development in developing country agriculture are extremely high r and d can help improve farmers incomes while helping hold down the price of staple foods to consumers
4539414 this is far below the one percent level recommended for developing countries and very much lower than the two to three percent observed in many countries the study said

4539471 you were the holder of a provisional driving licence who had had five lessons when you were 17 you are now 23
4539472 you were riding on the pavement neither of you had a helmet and people nearby who saw what was happening realised immediately that what you were doing was obviously very dangerous
4539473 as one witness described it was incredibly dangerous and as another sadly prophesied there would be an accident
4539474 this sentence is in no way meant to be a measure of the value of abbies life no one can put a value on abbies life like any life it is priceless

4539537 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4539538 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4539539 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4539551 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4539552 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor

4539554 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4539555 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4539556 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4539557 when i arrived here i didnt expect for sure to be in this final i arrived very tired
4539558 but when the week is coming i felt better and better im very happy to have this experience in my life
4539559 having beaten the best in the world and going for gold its an incredible scenario
4539560 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4539561 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals
4539562 what a relief the somali found dead next to a jar of cyanide in denver right before

4539566 through media we find out that americans threaten to destroy the nato russia council to punish russia
4539567 but who needs this nato russia council its a common interest
4539568 there is no iran in the north of europe but there is russia there
4539569 this system from the beginning is aimed at the neutralization of russian nuclear assets
4539570 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4539571 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4539572 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4539573 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4539574 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4539575 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4539576 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4539577 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4539578 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4539579 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4539580 were going to have to see but i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games the proof will be in the pudding but hopefully i will be fine
4539581 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully touch wood i will be able to do that
4539582 its been tough the toughest part of my career so far definitely
4539583 obviously there are rumours and everything there were times that it did get on top of me you have your friends and family and you need those people around you to keep you going
4539584 the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt fit at the time
4539585 then he doesnt really know the history of everything that comes with it i admit it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4539586 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4539587 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4539588 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us
4539589 weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it
4539590 there are 38 games and everyone is tough you have to be willing to grind out results when youre not playing so well and get results away from home
4539591 weve not been doing that and well have to do that if we want to break in the top four
4539592 with possible rare exceptions we will get everything out today
4539593 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4539594 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4539595 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic
4539596 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4539597 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true
4539598 they anointed us as the dream team but were not so dominant
4539599 were human were susceptible to making mistakes on the biggest stage and it showed
4539600 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4539601 thats why im here if not i wouldve stayed home and watched it on tv
4539602 this is a fantastic opportunity to give something back to the community if you work in wootton bassett it would be worth asking your employer if you could provide stand by cover in the day
4539603 until recently most retailers had been selling two litres for around 40 50p more than these latest prices and i believe this has sparked fears that iceland lidl aldi and other discounters will also drop their prices
4539604 with soaring costs of this nature an increase in farm gate prices are essential to stem the flow of milk producers leaving the industry
4539605 such an increase has to be significant but that will be very difficult to achieve if milk becomes the subject of a prolonged price war
4539606 in the current economic climate customers are telling us they want a range of products which will help to ease some the financial pressure they are facing
4539607 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic

4539642 but i am amazed at myself the more i love mankind in general the less i love people in particular that is individually as separate persons in my dreams
4539643 i often went so far as to think passionately of serving mankind and it may be would really have gone to the cross for people if it were somehow suddenly necessary and yet i am incapable of living in the same room with anyone even for two days this i know from experience as soon as someone is there close to me his personality oppresses my self esteem and restricts my freedom in twenty four hours i can begin to hate even the best of men one because he takes too long eating his dinner another because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose i become the enemy of people the moment they touch me
4539644 on the other hand it has always happened that the more i hate people individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity as a whole
4539645 because with what they do theyre kinda the popcap of japan
4539646 why doesnt the nyt just attack the facts of the book typical lefty junk they attack the author call him names just like the ball park in a pickup game with 8 year olds
4539647 the year 1995 was a banner one for obama he had just married michelle and the couple bought a hyde park condo the first home obama ever owned
4539648 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born
4539649 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil hasnt happened yet and its not going to happen im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4539650 stop living your life online and go be with people in person

4539655 the cctv building represents a mouthpiece of the chinese government their propaganda and lies that they spin not just to the world but to the chinese people themselves
4539656 blind chinese your country invaded tibet 50 years ago so so your protestations of
4539657 only by using their imagination will people understand why compromises should be made
4539658 these children have never experienced peace they dont have the chance to travel to other countries to see how it is this is all from their imagination
4539659 my little heart was tormented with pain for those images could cause rocks to cry
4539660 there isnt a prison that can deprive me of him because prisons have been demolished and converted into parks for children
4539661 filled with havoc weeds and piles of rubble barbed wire and soldiers with helmets
4539662 palestinian villages fall asleep in the dreamy green embrace of nature
4539663 many countries need our assistance in resolving conflicts and deep rooted disputes and restoring peace
4539664 the essays which the palestinian and israeli children have written are in fact one of the best indicators or opinion polls of what the situation really is like
4539665 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4539666 we are demanding a national solution to this dispute which addresses the real cost increases our members face unite has requested a national level meeting with the company to resolve this dispute but the clock is ticking and if this does not deliver our members will strike
4539667 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4539668 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4539669 we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4539670 its a bit worrying when ordinary families are struggling to make ends meet whilst council executives are sunning themselves in warmer climes
4539671 since crc took over responsibility for our it we have gained a level of confidence in our infrastructure from the optimum performance of our individual workstations to our servers
4539672 crc came in and made it very easy for us they provided us with the proper training tools that we needed they provided us with the right support
4539673 whats up guys last night i ran four miles in like 24 minutes but ill try to do better sorry to let you down
4539674 this new technology is allowing us to image the sea floor in unprecedented detail and is providing valuable information about the huge scale and immense power of these giant submarine flows
4539675 we have found that giant landslides are actually quite rare around the canary islands with no major activity in the last 15 000 years
4539676 at the moment we dont even know where the lisbon quake originated
4539677 we hope that new data from the deep ocean will provide information about the potential future threat to coastal communities
4539678 i think you can sometimes sense especially when he is interviewing alex salmond that he has a difficulty about scotland and scottish culture and it is possible that might be contributing to his views on burns
4539679 burns is a subtle and consummate poet and i dont think we need to worry about what jeremy paxman says about him
4539680 one of the fine things about burns is that he was not sentimental
4539681 of course he wrote a lot of trash but at his best he respected ordinary people and took their feelings seriously
4539682 divided between satire and sentimentality explosive vernacular and insipid english vigorous bawdry and pietistic moralising who was prevented from writing sustained poetry of the very highest sort
4539683 jeremy paxman should spend more time reading burns as burns wrote in to a louse o wad some powr the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us in light of his daft comments about burns jeremy looks like a gowk
4539684 i have noticed that something very troubling has happened theres no other way to put this their pants no longer provide adequate support
4539685 the scots have too much power and influence in english affairs
4539686 everyone in the village is very angry they feel the crew are being punished for trying to save a life
4539687 the boat at hope cove is vital because it takes 25 minutes for the lifeboat to get from salcombe and a swimmer could easily drown when the mca withdrew the boat in june they said it would be for six weeks but the crew wanted it back as soon as possible so they paid for the repairs themselves
4539688 they were then told it had to stay off service until it was surveyed and that would have taken it out for the whole of the summer season anyone would have done the same thing when they saw the girl in trouble
4539689 the health and safety of the boat crews and those who they may render assistance to is of paramount importance
4539690 search and rescue effectiveness will not be compromised by the suspension of the general purpose boat these general purpose boats are additional facilities and are not generally used as part of the first response to an incident
4539691 theres no doubt in our mind we want to focus on the playoffs
4539692 we had a better season last season than the coyotes did the season before we felt the pressure at the end of the season but we have to learn to cope with it everyones goal in the organization is to get into the playoffs and to win the stanley cup
4539693 its definitely an accomplishment to play as much as i do
4539694 i do like the pressure it means that im playing well and that im earning the ice time that im getting from my coach i like to be in the spotlight
4539695 playing the point on the power play gives you more of a responsibility
4539696 it also gives me more defensive responsibility i like that the coyotes gave me the opportunity to play the point on the power play and i feel it has made me a better defensive player because i am the last player back on my side

4539702 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine eco systems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4539703 i hardly even went to school and i left with very few qualifications
4539704 alex has worked very hard she spent most nights on the computer doing her homework
4539705 she is a very determined person she knows what she wants and she will go to any lengths to get it im really proud of her
4539706 i owe so much to my mum and the school
4539707 im delighted its fantastic im planning a big party with my friends this means everything to me
4539708 i love maths i just enjoy working with numbers where i know there is a definite answer
4539709 the school has been excellent the teachers have worked really hard and given me lots of extra lessons and helped me with my revision if i had gone to a normal mainstream school i probably would have done all right but i wouldnt have got such good results its strange to think that i probably wouldnt have done as well as i did if i hadnt been kidnapped when i was a baby

4539714 it beggars belief that penalties for uninsured drivers have become more lenient on this governments watch
4539715 uninsured drivers are a dangerous and often fatal blight on our roads and responsible motorists are forking out for higher premiums to pay for their misadventures
4539716 it is ridiculous that while you can be fined 1 000 for not buying a tv licence uninsured drivers can cause thousands of pounds of damage and get away with pathetically small penalties
4539717 labour has repeatedly sent out the wrong message to irresponsible drivers who flout the law and dodge paying insurance under labour crime does really pay
4539718 death on the roads should be dealt with fully and formally uninsured drivers are more likely to be involved in a crash than insured drivers
4539719 the rise in deaths involving un insured drivers is clearly worrying on the other hand magistrates are constrained in the fines that they can impose by the ability of the guilty party to pay
4539720 what we need is a consistent and clear message that driving without insurance is not a victimless crime but can lead to unnecessary deaths
4539721 with uninsured drivers costing british society around 500million each year the severity of penalties must act as a deterrent to those considering driving without insurance
4539722 in many cases all candidates have three as and increasingly four as
4539723 some talented pupils do more than three a levels because they enjoy the work and the challenge but you can see how some pupils might think that doing more might make them stand out from those with three as
4539724 in fact they might be disadvantaging themselves by taking the edge off their overall performance by doing so much
4539725 but im sure there are those who think that offering something extra will give them extra credit with universities it wont
4539726 increasingly pupils have opted for four or five as a way of distinguishing themselves from other candidates sixty per cent of our pupils do four a levels for this reason
4539727 my own feeling is that pupils should not be encouraged to do too many a levels because it eats into time that should be devoted to all those other important aspects of an education such as sport public speaking and the performing arts
4539728 as humorous as mr dions behaviour has been this spectacle of his threatening to defeat the government then backing down has to end
4539729 our revenge bobby sands said will be the laughter of our children
4539730 the great thing about your last journey is that you dont have to pack
4539731 ive been running so long but i feel like this is the first time people want to talk to me
4539732 i could have a great race and be 10th but i could also have a great race and win
4539733 so i just want to be in that position when i hear that bell for the last lap i want to have put myself in that position and then i think you need a little luck and the stars to align a little bit to come home with a medal
4539734 its been very exciting to see her blossom not just physically but psychologically and to be a young woman thats very confident of herself now
4539735 obviously its not how we always imagined but now its just ill run to represent the both of us
4539736 im getting goose bumps right now just thinking about it and i try not to think about it too much because i know how hard it is and how literally i have to have a lot of luck for that to happen but that would just be id probably be like done retired what could ever top this
4539737 im real satisfied when we get a chance to play a school like texas and next year we have kansas coming in here
4539738 i will have my lawyer monitor best of times we are making a list of the people who have slandered lible me
4539739 affordability is at an all time low and like with alcohol that just leads people to use more or stronger drugs whether it is a student using skunk a form of cannabis that is ten times stronger than the typical joint or a city workers cocaine binge
4539740 the rise in admissions can also be explained by using multiple drugs in greater quantities or purity all this will have an effect on your health
4539741 overall class a drug use has stabilised with the exception of cocaine which has risen over the past ten years as prices have fallen and is responsible for increases in hospital admissions for overdoses
4539742 these alarming figures reveal a wasted generation how many more lives will be lost before the government takes effective action we need better education and more powers to tackle the dealers who profit from this misery
4539743 skunk a form of cannabis that is ten times stronger than the typical joint
4539744 if you grow breed shoot or steal anything that may look at home on our menu then bring it in and lets do a deal
4539745 weve been doing it for almost two years now but the success of it has only just recently started to boom with the credit crunch setting in
4539746 people need to find different ways to go out and this helps
4539747 its also great for us because we get produce at a good price although we have high standards so the food we get in has to meet those
4539748 we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers when we get the good stuff and it gets on to the specials board its brilliant
4539749 someone will say that rabbit tasted great and we say here meet the person who shot it
4539750 its also a challenge for the chef to make the most of the ingredients
4539751 i have a job where i earn the national minimum wage so this little bit of extra money helps me get out
4539752 they call them oysters in america but we were once offered eight pairs of pigs testicles it brought a bit of a lump to my throat
4539753 we braised them off really slowly i cant quite remember what we charged i have a feeling that we gave them away for free
4539754 we need to look carefully at how pubs can make sure what theyre doing is safe for customers and within the law there is a difference between surplus game from a shoot and half a deer that may be a roadkill

4539768 well frankly 2 1 2 mills doesnt do much for me in the way of debt reduction
4539769 im not saying we shouldnt go forward with it but i was hoping to make more of a difference in mills
4539770 i think the thing that will kill this is the perception that we are going to use it to expand government
4539771 it would be nice if we could have the whole one percent that would really make an impact
4539772 if you want to do a one cent and dedicate it to this youre going to have to have some serious commitment
4539773 if youre going to do something like this you have to pick three solid people in your district and go out and drum up support for this
4539774 i dont know if its a bad idea to have three people who are firm proponents and one opponent theres no reason to move forward with this if theres no one behind the cause to support it
4539775 i think now is the time to take this and go talk to people
4539776 im not going to give you 65 percent come from out of county

4539782 i dont know if it would stop him but it would be difficult
4539783 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
4539784 im going to talk about the culture of life ive set the goal that every child born and unborn ought to be protected but i recognize that many people dont necessarily agree with the goal people appreciate somebody who sets a tone a tone that values life but recognizes that people disagree
4539785 our goal is to recognize all veterans no matter what period of service
4539786 could you please stop using fifty square feet of tissue every day
4539787 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4539788 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4539789 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4539790 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4539791 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4539792 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4539793 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4539794 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4539795 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4539796 here i am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily with books with one eye on my typewriter and the other on licorice the cat who has a great fondness for carbon paper and i am telling you that the emperor napoleon was a most contemptible person but should i happen to look out of the window down upon seventh avenue and hear the sound of heavy drums and see the little man on his white horse in his old and much worn green uniform then i dont know but i am afraid that i would leave my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to follow him wherever he cared to lead my own grandfather did this and heaven knows he was not born to be a hero
4539797 this years conference is entitled development of new molecular tumor markers for diagnosis and therapy the subject is well chosen and critical for good reason it reflects the acute need among the scientific community as well as clinicians for new cancer markers to be used in cancer diagnosis and therapy this need arises from the fact that there are presently very few markers their overall performance is not very good and they are limited to a few types of cancer it also reflects on the fact that since afp and cea were first described as cancer markers in the early 60s not many markers have been discovered biocurex has a unique cancer marker in the sense that it combines excellent performance in discriminating patients with cancer from those who do not have cancer along with the ability to detect very early stages of two of the most common cancers breast and prostate recaf our marker also has the potential to be used on a broad spectrum of cancers which is a tremendous advantage at isobm 2008 well be showing results related to the elisa format a type of test that can be carried out in most research and clinical labs we expect to elicit significant interest among scientists to carry out collaborations that will continue to validate independently and through numerous publications the very good performance of the recaf tests
4539798 there is a straightforward way to pay for half of this fix
4539799 with the right incentives in place medicare should generate over 100 billion in savings over the next decade by bringing the high cost areas down to the national average on 30 day rehospitalizations
4539800 there have been quite a few milestones this year with halo 3 and grand theft auto iv where the numbers are bigger than a lot of movies
4539801 the demo is not what it used to be where its not just for 13 to 15 year old boys there are a lot of women now my mom plays the wii
4539802 this is a growth area of the business and we want to put more of a focus on that area
4539803 we want to inform the customer that blockbuster is the place to go for games we might do that through more signage or place some titles in higher trafficked areas
4539804 we have made a major merchandising commitment to games in the past year
4539805 with disney product you can do a lot of cross promotion where maybe you can bundle titles and offer discounts if you buy the dvd and the game
4539806 for some of the smaller retailers there is that specialty feel where they might know the product more
4539807 small retailers can create that environment that invites people in
4539808 a game can get maximum exposure here so the game companies love us
4539809 he was a special person and he cared about his state
4539810 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4539811 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4539812 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4539813 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4539814 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4539815 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4539816 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television
4539817 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
4539818 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4539819 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4539820 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4539821 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4539822 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4539823 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4539824 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4539825 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4539826 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4539827 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4539828 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4539829 what do you want your look to say to people
4539830 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4539831 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4539832 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4539833 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4539834 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4539835 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4539836 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4539837 they used to say money and profits dictated everything in hollywood
4539838 the path to 9 11 had a huge viewership yet it didnt mean a thing
4539839 youd like to see an organization dedicated to the freedom of creative expression right here in town come forth
4539840 from our standpoint it had many hours of broadcast time so it was exposed its not like it was stifled and no one heard it
4539841 in our opinion it was a business decision by disney you have to assume if disney thought theyd make money theyd release it
4539842 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4539843 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4539844 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4539845 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4539846 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4539847 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4539848 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4539849 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4539850 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4539851 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4539852 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4539853 so yeah were a bunch of guys and were making this top down shooter
4539854 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic
4539855 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4539856 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4539857 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4539858 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4539859 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4539860 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4539861 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4539862 when we first came into the airport for the olympics we had to go out the back door
4539863 were like why they said theyre all waiting for jenny we turn around and its like jenny yesterday i saw a guy lose his shoe trying to get to her he lost his shoe and continued to get a photograph of her and it wasnt even a good picture it was the back of her head
4539864 shes really big i had heard stories but i didnt realize how big until i saw it with my own eyes
4539865 when she walks in there is just as much an uproar for her as there is for the chinese team
4539866 even the young kids know who she is and they never saw her play apparently shes in the history books in china
4539867 it doesnt matter if we play china if we play cuba every match is the same
4539868 china is only one of the teams we have to play against i tried to concentrate on the game and not be emotionally involved ive been coaching the u s team for the last four years so this is not my first time to coach them in china
4539869 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4539870 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4539871 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4539872 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4539873 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4539874 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4539875 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4539876 cleveland ohio but i mostly grew up in the ie inland empire what about you
4539877 oh wow my dad and brother live in santa clarita canyon country actually
4539878 yeah me too canyon country is so different from the rest of santa clarita isnt it
4539879 yeah there are just so many christians its kinda scary do you know what they would say to me as i cut their hair
4539880 almost everyday someone would say to me and this was like the first thing they would say after they sat down do you go to church
4539881 yeah sometimes if it was a really old person and i thought i might give them a heart attack i would just lie and be like yeah but most of the time i would just say no
4539882 they would say ill pray for you it was so creepy i just had to get out of there one time someone even told me that if i didnt go to church that i was going to hell
4539883 i really appreciate your stories about the christians you encountered in santa clarita i especially appreciate them because im the pastor of a christian church here in hollywood
4539884 in fact i agree with you completely that some christians can be very pushy and overbearing i wish you could tell your story to my church members because i sense that about 95 of them would feel exactly as you do even though theyre christians maybe even because theyre christian
4539885 my mom is like that shes a christian but she like accepts gays thats really cool and shes never pushing her religion on other people i really respect that
4539886 there are lots and lots of christians who would be just as embarrassed as you about the things you heard in those hair salons
4539887 and someone that obviously cares about the church and stuff how do you feel about george bush and how he claims to be a christian
4539888 dif cil compor um novo lbum e querer mostr lo ao vivo com a tecnologia de hoje sempre vai ter algu m com um gravador para estragar nossa festa
4539889 n o tocamos in ditas para que elas n o caiam no youtube ou qualquer rede parecida
4539890 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4539891 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4539892 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4539893 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4539894 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4539895 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4539896 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4539897 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4539898 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4539899 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4539900 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4539901 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4539902 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4539903 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4539904 so yeah were a bunch of guys and were making this top down shooter
4539905 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4539906 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4539907 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4539908 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4539909 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4539910 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4539911 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4539912 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4539913 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4539914 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4539915 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4539916 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4539917 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4539918 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4539919 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4539920 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4539921 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4539922 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4539923 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4539924 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4539925 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4539926 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4539927 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4539928 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4539929 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4539930 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4539931 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4539932 based on recent indictments against sen stevens i felt it was appropriate to donate the 1 000 contribution his pac made to my campaign in 2004
4539933 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4539934 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4539935 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4539936 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4539937 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4539938 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4539939 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4539940 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4539941 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4539942 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4539943 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4539944 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4539945 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4539946 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4539947 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4539948 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4539949 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4539950 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4539951 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4539952 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4539953 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4539954 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4539955 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4539956 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4539957 just so you all know we did set a record
4539958 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4539959 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4539960 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4539961 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4539962 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4539963 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4539964 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4539965 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4539966 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4539967 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4539968 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4539969 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4539970 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4539971 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4539972 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4539973 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4539974 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4539975 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4539976 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4539977 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4539978 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4539979 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4539980 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4539981 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4539982 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4539983 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4539984 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4539985 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4539986 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4539987 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4539988 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4539989 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4539990 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4539991 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4539992 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4539993 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4539994 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4539995 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4539996 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4539997 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4539998 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4539999 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
