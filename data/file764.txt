7640037 it was a really old bare building it was originally the saugatuck antique mall about 25 years ago i just brought it back alive
7640038 i was anticipating wed probably have the laketown golf and conference center and belvedere inn be the first ones but well take them as they come in and consider each one separately
7640039 im hoping everything will go well i aim to please the residents and what i feel is in demand for this area including a good breakfast place and bakery for saugatuck
7640040 i went kind of simple this time but its something ive wanted to do for a long time i received this clock for christmas last year youre supposed to put photos in it but i put stamped images in it instead thought it would make a fun colorful clock for my scraproom the silhouette stamps are some of my favorites the only thing i wished was that the silver frame wasnt so shiny smooth i would have loved to have stamped some swirls in the corners and along the photos but i would have made a mess with it since its so slick in other words i was too chicken to mess it up lol i used plain old school watercolor to paint on the watercolor paper once they dried i simply stamped the silhouette images with black ink and placed them in the clock
7640041 both of my cards show creating my entire background with stamps and coloring mediums
7640042 im very sorry for what ive done im sorry to my family for the embarrassment
7640043 a lot of them feel they represent people who sent them here to vote for me

7640045 honest to goodness how many times can you yell at your tv screen
7640046 how often can you just say i dont believe this i mean if you were to read a script of the last eight years it would be hard to think it actually happened
7640047 this is unbearable physical torture it is purposeful controlled drowning
7640048 it is illegal and the people who work inside the federal courthouse are charged with the responsibility of enforcing these laws
7640049 they told us to be ready this morning and we were thrilled

7640059 are working on a deal to give her some votes in the roll call for the democratic presidential nomination but quickly end the divided balloting in unanimous consent for obama
7640060 the idea is that at the start of the state by state vote for the presidential nomination wednesday night delegates would cast their votes for clinton or obama
7640061 but the voting would be cut off after a couple of states the officials said perhaps ending with new york when clinton herself would call for unanimous backing for obama from the convention floor
7640062 in 2008 it is the year of evaluation and by the end of it we will decide where to go
7640063 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
7640064 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
7640065 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
7640066 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential

7640076 we are creating a source for irrigation that otherwise would not be used
7640077 every drop of water can make the land here potentially into agricultural land
7640078 with the depletion of the water table from the ground there are opportunities for saltier water to seep in and contaminate the fresh water
7640079 this is not a water crisis its a political crisis
7640080 this will stabilize the water situation in the medium and long term
7640081 the difference about today is that there are the technological tools to cope with this crisis
7640082 when people take responsibility and dont wait for rainfall alone we can assist nature and help find solutions
7640083 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment

7640124 and the twenty fifth of august had come again and this winter and summer were the one hundred twenty third year
7640125 the american dream defines both a value system and a broad economic reform agenda focused on jobs with wages that can support families affordable health care retirement security and opportunity for a better future
7640126 workers see the dream at risk and want government action to create a new infrastructure for a new american dream they want a candidate who is not controlled by big corporations and who will support progressive taxes limits on corporate power worker rights and proactive government
7640127 wages have not kept pace with economic growth increased productivity and skyrocketing executive compensation the decline in health care and pension coverage has left workers without basic economic security
7640128 the fear and outrage over the lose of the american dream rises directly from long term economic trends that are robbing americans of their wages their health care and their pensions
7640129 we must build a new infrastructure for a new american dream and that infrastructure begins with the rights of workers empowered workers will create the new american dream for the 21st century
7640130 the seven unions of change to win will spend tens of millions of dollars and commit thousands of volunteer hours to contact members at their worksites and in their communities every day between now and november 4th to make sure barack obama is elected president and pro worker majorities are put in the united states congress with a comprehensive mail phone and canvass effort in thirteen battleground states including a full time coordinated member to member canvass with 1 500 member canvassers more than 10 million pieces of direct mail and 20 million phone calls the unions of change to win will make sure americas workers are the deciding vote in 2008

7640133 i maintain a good and close friendship with my wife even though it can be hard to do sometimes she has been a close friend to me for the past year and a half and one of the main reasons for the separation was to keep from losing our friendship
7640134 the first round is never easy said dementieva who stopped serena williams and vera zvonareva before beating russian compatriot dinara safina in the gold medal match at the olympics

7640150 there are some very stark parallels between hip hop and the negro leagues
7640151 neither one was expected to survive but here we are how many years later and its one of the most influential types of music out there
7640152 nobody gave the negro leagues a chance but it lasted 40 years
7640153 the case comes down to individual rights versus political correctness
7640154 at heart this is a case involving very base motivations
7640155 max and erla had a dream with respect to the provisions of their will and if you will it it is no dream
7640156 the question arises as to whether the grandchild would be resurrected upon marrying the jewish spouse
7640157 my father let my son aron know he wasnt happy with the idea of diluting the familys jewishness

7640159 m and i and a lot of friends are in yerevan we left tbilisi this morning it was so hard to leave well be observing further developments from here i feel paralysed im so worried about people who are still there especially in tskhinvali all these people displaced again and bitter there wont be any hope for peace in peoples hearts now for at least 2 more generations im afraid

7640161 something is coocking up this country is getting ready for war people
7640162 we will be a different medical school when we are done
7640163 the intent is to get people from different research perspectives mixing together and hopefully to get ideas that wouldnt emerge otherwise
7640164 in the past weve only seen each other in the hallway or on an elevator once in a while
7640165 the old days of working in a dark lab with fruit flies without a clinical endpoint are gone
7640166 at a lot of other cancer centers the researchers in the labs are well separated from the clinics
7640167 here the idea is to bring basic research right next to the hospital
7640168 he said i cant believe im giving you a hug when you werent with me
7640169 let me state what i think about those ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7640170 make no mistake we are united we are united for change of course we are democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united
7640171 clear purpose to come out of here ready to elect barack obama president of the united states
7640172 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention as it should be we are trying to bring everyone together with the same level of commitment that i feel
7640173 i dont know im doing everything i possibly can do i think we have made a strong case
7640174 it would have been the same way if barack obama had won and wed be fighting for the unity of our party
7640175 for months shes been dogged by questions of whether shes doing enough
7640176 what more can she possibly say shes made it clear
7640177 not we have one superstar nominee people will realize that this election is a choice between bush part two or barack obama there is no question in my mind they will be for barack obama
7640178 electing john mccain would be a mistake for our country
7640179 anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with barack obama
7640180 i am working as hard as i can to elect barack obama
7640181 electing john mccain would be a mistake for our country
7640182 anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with barack obama
7640183 theres nothing i can do about it except speak out against it
7640184 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve this message
7640185 in my opinion mr dogg is abusing the legal system to oppress an innocent person who should be held up as an example for teens everywhere he did not trademark all uses and meanings of the word snoop and this product in no way creates any confusion or association with his likeness or brand
7640186 in that case you had a single person able to hold an entire multimillion dollar company hostage so that it lost millions just waiting for the case to be heard you also had an open intent by the company to invoke the image of spike lee among others heaths mother came up with the name snooptunes and she strongly dislikes rap music she had no intention of invoking a gangsta image for her teenage daughters product moreover there is no economic hostage opportunity for dogg we are talking about a start up that needs capital to grow not a company with coffers to pay off frivolous lawsuits just to avoid the cost of fighting this case will have to be resolved on the basis of its legal merits and though i am not an attorney i do not believe he is in the position of power on that subject
7640187 make sure its on properly or youll get in trouble
7640188 since i was about 18 or 19 theyve been my favourite band
7640189 i loved lowell george the way he played and sang and the funkiness of their records
7640190 i can already buy an insignia blu ray player best buys house brand for just 280 whats the big deal
7640191 it literally takes place 20 minutes after casino royale ends
7640192 we pick the story up obviously with james bond out for revenge on a personal vendetta it then gets more complicated than that
7640193 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7640194 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7640195 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7640196 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7640197 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7640198 yeah i like my window it has painting on it
7640199 some are green or blue one letter is yellow thats for grandma
7640200 do you see why this is my favorite store in the world
7640201 do you think it might be your favorite store in the world too
7640202 the strength of the show is that the audience wants to meet those 20 contestants so well spend more time with them
7640203 at one point we had neil diamond on and andrew lloyd webber and dolly parton nigel wanted to be old school but the show needs younger music
7640204 i am going to be on oprah september 11th on some olympic medalists special
7640205 as the war for talent picked up and we kept looking for people with very specific experience and the talent pool became narrow other people wanted to jump into that talent pool by embellishing their r sum s
7640206 in percentage terms this the number of cv liars might just be something like 1 per cent of the applicant population but it is still a significant figure given the kind of trust based work that we do we do not want this happening
7640207 its not good either to have 300 or 400 people out of the few thousand people that we get in every quarter who have not made the grade
7640208 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid clinton as the vice presidential pick of the party
7640209 certainly in political life religion has had a terribly detrimental effect i mean did you see the rick warren thing
7640210 and by the way let me just preface this by saying im asking people for perspective i have it also rick warren big improvement over pat robertson and jerry falwell if we have to have a pope of the super christ ies id rather it be him hes got good ideas about actually you know actually helping people because you know one thing i dont like about religion is that you know ask any of the truly devout its not mainly about doing the right thing or being ethical its mainly about salvation its mainly about getting your butt saved when you die and thats why i think theyre less moral than ethicists
7640211 so were not trying to point fingers in this movie i think we do it were laughing all the way through it i think were winking and having a good time and were not trying to be judgmental but at some point you know mankind is going to have to shed this skin if hes going to move forward i do have a serious intellectual problem with it and on another level it just ticks me off its just the ultimate hustle its just pay no attention to the man behind the curtain you know why cant they i always ask i asked jesus at holy land why cant god just defeat the devil and get rid of evil you know and its the same reason the comic book character cant get rid of his nemesis then theres no story if god gets rid of the devil and he could hes all powerful well then theres no fear theres no reason to come to church theres no reason to pass the plate were all out of a job you know its got to go on
7640212 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
7640213 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
7640214 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
7640215 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
7640216 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
7640217 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
7640218 reveals the deep and hidden things and knows what lies in darkness
7640219 we strongly hope that benedict xvi will make a trip to china
7640220 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
7640221 under the pressure of particular circumstances have consented to receive episcopal ordination without the pontifical mandate but have subsequently asked to be received into communion with the successor of peter and with their other brothers in the episcopate
7640222 anyone can make a bolt on system but not anyone can give you the innovations and patent pending technologies fmf offers
7640223 we are certainly trying to be as straightforward with this budget as we can
7640224 but we want everyone to know that there are very considerable pressures
7640225 but we are also seeing considerable swings in price every month
7640226 so this number is subject to change throughout the year
7640227 nova scotians depending on the price of home heating fuel could have a very tough winter
7640228 we are determined to do what is necessary to bring in a balanced budget
7640229 high energy prices are good for the government of nova scotia
7640230 lets make no mistake about it when energy prices go up the royalties go up a lot and the costs of running the government go up a little
7640231 in contrast high energy prices are a disaster for the people of nova scotia something is seriously out of balance here
7640232 ordinary nova scotians are going to be faced with the energy crisis that this government has been unable to deal with
7640233 youll feel better collecting anything that you havent collected yet
7640234 to fully realize that more productive place you will need to capture it all
7640235 doing the collection process as fully as you can and then incorporating the behaviors of capturing all the new things as they emerge will be empowering and productive

7640325 the american dream defines both a value system and a broad economic reform agenda focused on jobs with wages that can support families affordable health care retirement security and opportunity for a better future
7640326 workers see the dream at risk and want government action to create a new infrastructure for a new american dream they want a candidate who is not controlled by big corporations and who will support progressive taxes limits on corporate power worker rights and proactive government
7640327 wages have not kept pace with economic growth increased productivity and skyrocketing executive compensation the decline in health care and pension coverage has left workers without basic economic security
7640328 the fear and outrage over the lose of the american dream rises directly from long term economic trends that are robbing americans of their wages their health care and their pensions
7640329 we must build a new infrastructure for a new american dream and that infrastructure begins with the rights of workers empowered workers will create the new american dream for the 21st century

7640362 la oficina de prensa del arzobispado de corrientes comunica a la feligres a de corrientes ante la inauguraci n de la denominada capilla virgen de itat que pertenece a los lefebvristas
7640363 los lefebvristas pertenecen a una iglesia cism tica debido a que no aceptan la autoridad suprema del papa ni el acontecimiento del concilio vaticano ii con sus documentos conclusivos adem s de que han realizado ordenaciones episcopales sin la debida autorizaci n
7640364 la participaci n de fieles cat licos a las ceremonias oficiadas por los presb teros de dicha iglesia es por tanto objetivamente il cita y escandalosa
7640365 pero s lo hab a un gran espejo en la pared
7640366 entonces no tenemos problema en aceptar que la otra persona tambi n es una imagen de dios
7640367 la sala de meditaci n est abierta a todos pero s lo uno por vez
7640368 me di cuenta que dios est en m no en una iglesia tambi n comprend que me confrontaba y me ayud a comportarme mejor con los otros
7640369 dios es misericordioso bello considerado y compasivo y por lo tanto yo tambi n porque dios est en m
7640370 no diferenciar s m s entre negros y blancos altos y bajos hind es y musulmanes porque todos somos la imagen de dios y el vive en todos
7640371 pero una vez que uno comienza a analizarse delante del espejo uno se da cuenta que lo que uno consideraba sus debilidades es una bendici n oculta uno comienza a apreciar la creaci n divina y agradecerle
7640372 antes rezaba ante el crucifijo o el sagrario por eso al principio pens que era tonto rezar ante un espejo

7640374 janssens product risperdal received a preferential recommendation as a medication of choice on the project algorithms used to treat children and adolescents
7640375 defendants product did not have an fda approved indication for use in children and adolescents when it was placed on the tcmap algorithms
7640376 tmap and tcmap proved to be powerful marketing tools for risperdal
7640377 driven by these gains and revenues defendants turned to developing a concerted marketing plan to replicate these programs and the dramatic revenue and market share generated by tmap and its progeny in other states
7640378 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7640379 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7640380 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7640381 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

7640386 i am honored to follow in the footsteps of joos horsten a serial entrepreneur who was a key figure in the development of the western pharmaceutical industry in china
7640387 as a result of joos leadership and foresight rhei pharmaceuticals is uniquely positioned to accelerate the availability of already approved western medicines in the chinese market and i am fortunate to be working with the world class team that joos had assembled in order to pursue its growth strategy
7640388 with one potential launch this year followed by three in 2009 including asacard r and an additional product launch planned each year thereafter until 2012 rhei pharmaceuticals is expected to achieve very rapid growth it is our goal to become the partner of choice for western companies that want to tap into the fast growing chinese health care market as well as for those chinese companies that are interested in distributing western drugs domestically

7640415 jarda is very demanding of himself and it wasnt easy for him in new york
7640416 when he wasnt having a good run we were talking a lot
7640417 jarda has always told me you shouldve signed me up for tennis that way you couldve cursed me out but here im dependent on other players and the north americans are different than europeans not all of them but those in new york were all so north south not very creative sure he was sour but he was also saying just you wait for the playoffs and he was right if drury didnt get hurt it couldve been even better
7640418 at his age he has bigger motivation to play there
7640419 there were few nhl teams interested in jaromir it was difficult and he never wanted to play on a team that didnt rely on him its obvious that if he was north american theyd handle him completely differently i remember craig patricks words from the pittsburgh days patrick told him in 2000 that america doesnt want him to be best but jarda still wanted to show them

7640427 toda la campa a de agresi n contra alba es una jugada de estados unidos para frenar lo que no va a frenar porque hay una revoluci n y un proceso de cambio en am rica latina
7640428 detr s de la campa a contra alba est n los pitiyanquis que son arrastrados y que abundan por todas estas tierras buena parte de los medios de comunicaci n est en manos de los pitiyanquis que lamen la mano de los yanquis

7640439 the judges should have been reinstated on aug 19 the day after musharrafs resignation
7640440 now it is being said that agreements are not binding like the quran
7640441 nawaz sharif has been too inflexible on the judges issue
7640442 where mr sharif proved that his politics had no room for flexibility mr zardari showed to the world that his definition of ethics in politics was somewhat different from that held by most others
7640443 we made a mistake by signing an agreement to restore the judges
7640444 once you make a mistake the problem is that you keep repeating it
7640445 zardari is more ruthless and more cunning it was a display of realpolitik he doesnt give a damn about agreements he wants to consolidate his government he will lose popularity but popularity matters six months before an election not six months after it
7640446 our time has now come zardari will be our president
7640447 from the american point of view that would be a plus there will be one man sitting in the presidency who can handle all the decisions
7640448 the americans are concerned about sharifs closeness to religious parties
7640449 sharif represents a very important constituency and his support would have been helpful by isolating him there is a risk of isolating his base
7640450 most people in this country i dont think will be happy with it given mr zardaris reputation
7640451 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7640452 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7640453 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7640454 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7640499 shes been producing a couple dozen puppies a year her entire life and her only human contact i imagine is limited to being scruffed having her puppies plucked off her and then put into a box to start the process all over again that has been her existence

7640554 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

7640609 the purpose of this is for you to learn what these oil field items look like
7640610 so when you pull somebody over for a traffic stop and they are loaded down with oil field pipe you will have a better idea of what is going on
7640611 people that didnt grow up in the oil field business like i did will find this helpful
7640612 our number one priority at the fbi is to prevent the u s from another 9 11
7640613 every time we go out and check a military installation we find about a dozen illegal immigrants doing contract work on the base
7640614 they are always from mexico but our concern is that one of these days one of these guys might be a terrorist operative from overseas
7640615 they were going to create a small explosion at first to attract all first responders they would then detonate bigger bombs that would kill off all the first responders
7640616 a state of stupidity derived from cloudy thinking so prevalent you could be trailing toilet paper from your buttocks to the crapper down the hall and have no clue
7640617 i have some bags of just clothes and stuff school books and im thinking should i hide these theyre just kind of lying out in my seat so now i try to either put stuff under the seat or just try not to leave it laying out
7640618 ive actually had my car broken into before so now im a little more cautious about what i keep laying out
7640619 theyll break your window grab the purse and then theyre immediately going to a convenience store or shopping mall and theyre shopping using your credit cards
7640620 when you pull up to park be aware look and see if theres possibly just someone sitting in a vehicle
7640621 i used to stick them in my console and lock it
7640622 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7640623 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7640624 you cant have security in the world if the american economy is bad this is how i i i i did it
7640625 completely supported the decision of the dnc convention in denver muwhahahahahah
7640626 well give you peasants a chance to vote the right way and if you dont well take over and make sure it gets done right thank you very much
7640627 chega desta irresponsabilidade tropical desta indec ncia social disfar ada de bonomia desta irresolu o criminosa que passa por afabilidade deste eterno adiamento de tudo fa a nos escandinavos j
7640628 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7640629 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7640630 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7640631 were going to make sure that we win on nov 4 so lets have a great convention
7640632 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7640633 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7640634 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7640635 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election
7640636 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
7640637 in 2006 etcheverry began helping members of the community get involved in charity work by organizing
7640638 vi f r r kna med s na h r
7640639 es temerario y ligero salir a decir que entraron a la presidencia de la rep blica clandestinamente cuando est n las filmaciones y cuando est el registro en libros de los veh culos que entraron
7640640 first he claimed not to be a lobbyist even though his lobby disclosure form is a matter of public record and now he has misfiled an fec report so voters dont truly understand how much he has in his campaign coffers
7640641 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7640642 para no tener la necesidad de acudir ante la corte interamericana de derechos humanos o la corte penal internacional

7640645 oreo cookies and milk were a tradition in our house growing up and my sister and i fondly remember twisting licking and dunking them together
7640646 it was only natural to continue that tradition as adults which is why we jumped at the chance to be a part of the dsrl
7640647 and because we love a friendly rivalry itll be fun to show the mannings what real dsrl competition is like theyre going down
7640648 ive known and watched asia develop for several years now
7640649 we are all so proud that she is representing vegas and wanted to mark this very special occasion with something that has never been done before so as a special gift we custom fitted her racquet with 1 00ctw of vs quality pave set diamonds in 2 letter as above her grip
7640650 this is the first time ive actually put diamonds on a piece of athletic equipment
7640651 however we came up with a special process to affix it to the racquet with a special technology to transfer the letters to a new racquet when asia wears out the first one the same diamonds can be added to a golf club and makes a very exclusive gift for any exceptional athlete in most any sport
7640652 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7640653 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7640654 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7640655 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7640656 we are looking at a number of things we might do
7640657 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7640658 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7640659 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7640660 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7640661 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7640662 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7640663 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7640664 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying in birds and other smaller animals
7640665 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7640666 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7640667 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7640668 there are theories about hormonal differences but none has been proved
7640669 its been documented in several studies that men are at increased risk of recurrence
7640670 this needs to be validated in a second study which we are currently planning
7640671 the study will take about two years to recruit patients and will have a one year follow up so results are expected in three years
7640672 one would be happy to be able to recommend stopping
7640673 the current recommendation is to remain on long term therapy but many patients elect not to do it
7640674 oftentimes patients choose not to take an anticoagulant blood thinner
7640675 so a physician might feel more comfortable to allow women with one or fewer of these risk factors to discontinue the medication
7640676 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7640677 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7640678 now something more annoying has happened i can no longer burn discs with simple text files on them anything with a txt extension will stop the burn an ruin the disc
7640679 your intel based macs cannot read a file created from classic i think thats what the problem is here
7640680 disconnect if idle is set for 10 minutes verizon put that number in there but it can be raised i did not though as vz manager disconnects if a

7640682 el estatus de estas dos regiones en georgia no puede ser decidido por un solo pa s es un asunto para la comunidad internacional a trav s de los mecanismos de la onu
7640683 es justo decir que a n no est n cumpliendo con los t rminos del acuerdo de cese del fuego
7640684 todav a vemos un gran n mero de tropas rusas en la zona en disputa mantienen los puestos de control y su actividad en el puerto de poti por lo que no hay duda de que rusia contin a violando el acuerdo
7640685 apple is one of the major leaders in the multitouch space and yet the companys desire to bring a full fledged touch screen device to store shelves has stopped with the iphone in fact the most it has done in bringing multitouch to its computers is offering the functionality in the track pad on its macbook air
7640686 but simply offering multitouch on a trackpad isnt enough to make consumers want to flock to apple products instead of hp or dell machines
7640687 apple needs to embrace the fact that many people prefer touch screen technology and create a mac that offers the same basic functionality found in the iphone
7640688 innovation has been a key to apples success over the past decade and without it the company would be nothing more than another computer vendor but by releasing a mac that eclipses the functionality of the tablet pc and fully harnesses the power of multitouch in a way that no one has seen before apple can create the computing worlds first iphone like success
7640689 and in the process apple could single handedly propel the computing market forward into a new era where vanilla products are the exception and establish itself as the de facto leader in innovation
7640690 so what would it look like ideally the computer could be controlled with the touch screen and if you prefer you can type on it as well for those who arent so keen on typing on a virtual keyboard apples touch screen mac should sport a physical keyboard that can be slid out in terms of aesthetics ill leave that up to apple i think it has proven to be quite capable in designing handsome products
7640691 i think it has proven to be quite capable in designing handsome products
7640692 whos gonna buy one of these instead of a laptop
7640693 i think the minor parties are showing much more sign of being rational than the liberal opposition are at the moment they clearly have issues in many of these areas they want to discuss with us but i have spoken to each of them and they are open to a sensible discussion
7640694 im hopeful they will see sense but if they dont if they decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7640695 we have to decide whether the government has really made the case for these tax increases which they gave no notice to the australian people of they have no mandate for and which we think potentially are a big problem in a situation where the economy is running into troubled waters and inflation is still a problem
7640696 we have indicated publicly our serious reservations about these measures given they have no mandate for any of this
7640697 there was concern about implementation but you know if children are missing out on schooling then you have got to do something about that
7640698 this is a government which is obsessed with each days headline
7640699 dialogue franc et sinc re avec toute la classe politique
7640700 the guys is hitting 290 with an 828 ops and you think theres a problem why any team would be proud to have such a player on their team
7640701 the creative groove studio offers childrens classes for babies to 10 year olds in music latin dance bilingual classes english spanish stand up comedy intro to improv and more we also offer childrens birthday parties in the evening and on weekends the studio is used for adult dance classes in latin and ballroom dancing we offer private lessons for wedding couples our wedding dance website is www yourspecialdance com and private classes for individuals or couples who want to learn latin or ballroom dances in september we start adult group classes in argentine tango and salsa my husband oscar burgos teaches the adult dance classes i co ordinate the childrens classes and birthday parties i will also be teaching the stand up comedy classes for children i perform stand up comedy in new york i founded a pre school latin dance and spanish language program dance four years ago in hoboken i rented space at creative little monsters to teach those classes i took over the lease in january when the owners of creative little monsters closed the coloring book store
7640702 kwame kilpatrick just happens to be the symbol of bold uncompromising black power in this city
7640703 i realize the most important thing is the team although i want to play
7640704 thats what were here for is to play preseason regular season doesnt matter other guys look at it differently than i do thats the competitive nature in me speaking
7640705 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume he would probably say no if thats the case then so be it
7640706 im going so see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it
7640707 its an ongoing debate how you treat that fourth game
7640708 in this game often it can resurrect some people and it can whatever the opposite of resurrect is laughing
7640709 whatever is going to happen is going to happen i cant control that
7640710 i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7640711 which should make you all happy because now you have your favorite thing of all an excuse for why the team blew it for a 3rd year running
7640712 kind of an underrated part of hawkins game hes certainly not a guy you can count on winning a game with his legs but hes also a guy whos going to be a little more productive than you think with his legs
7640713 i dont think thats something were going to design an entire game plan around but he certainly has the capability to make that a part of it
7640714 i always think every offense is better suited for a guy whos a little more mobile as long as he can still sling it
7640715 we still want to be able to throw the football efficiently and i think theres a certain type of guy that requires
7640716 you have to play to their strengths cody sees the field well starts in the right place almost all the time you have to build on his strengths and build the game plan around that
7640717 i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team favre said
7640718 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7640719 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7640720 ive never really thought about it and im not saying osi did think about it favre said
7640721 i saw the tape that was meant to be its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably would have happened in practice at some point the way it occurred

7640728 wouldnt you logically want to see many reputable hardware makers in the business i would love to be able to run os x on vaios and umpcs and other machines apple would have to exercise a great deal of control in order to maintain the ease of use and reliability but at least it would allow hardware vendors to build the best possible box within apples guidelines
7640729 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7640730 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7640731 ldl cholesterol levels below 2 80 mmol l and levels of at least 3 90 mmol l were both associated with markedly elevated risk of cancer among patients who did not use statins
7640732 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7640733 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7640734 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7640735 it literally takes place 20 minutes after casino royale ends
7640736 we pick the story up obviously with james bond out for revenge on a personal vendetta it then gets more complicated than that
7640737 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7640738 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7640739 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7640740 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7640741 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7640742 i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
7640743 mccain has never signed on to efforts to overturn roe vs wade
7640744 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
7640745 the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the

7640748 to returns for next weeks lineup you need to go to the bottom of the screen and fill out a short form
7640749 it may be safe for women who have taken oral anticoagulants for 5 7 months after an unprovoked venous thromboembolism to discontinue therapy if they have 0 or 1 of the following 1 hyperpigmentation brown discoloration edema swelling or redness of either leg 2 a d dimer level blood clotting test of 250ug l or more while taking warfarin 3 bmi body mass index 30kg m2 and aged 65 years or more
7640750 it appears all men are at high risk of recurrence
7640751 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7640752 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7640753 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7640754 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7640755 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7640756 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7640757 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7640758 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7640759 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7640760 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
7640761 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
7640762 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
7640763 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
7640764 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
7640765 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships
7640766 the overall quality of customer experience is largely defined by personalized online interactions companies that consistently deliver these positive customer experiences across all touch points maintain consumer loyalty build stronger brands and are better able to avoid competition on price alone therefore they grow faster and earn healthier profits than companies that dont consider consumer experience a priority
7640767 with more access to information more sensitivity to price and less sensitivity to advertising customers are getting harder to win and keep organizations try to woo these empowered consumers with mediocre experiences but it wont work firms need to dramatically raise the bar on the customer experience they provide

7640770 the mountain is our only source of water and it regulates the regions climate
7640771 one hundred years ago this was a mining zone but that left the area neither gold nor progress just a huge environmental debt
7640772 we are the only province which practically has no rivers water means everything for us
7640773 i dont understand people who say we are going to pollute
7640774 i dont know of a single case of people who have died of this famous pollution they are trying to scare people but we arent going to bring this to a halt
7640775 the 2007 laws were never codified and implemented so two new ones were passed one that designates the secretariat of the environment as the regulatory authority for the mining industry and another that create a consultative council
7640776 we are not opposed to mining what we want is responsible mining
7640777 polluting the water would be a crime in a province without rivers where virtually all of the water consumed has to be extracted from underground sources
7640778 mining activity from the period when la mexicana was active in the area left tremendously acid drainage at the headwaters and we ourselves never saw any of the gold
7640779 since the laws against open cast mining were overturned we have been in a state of permanent assembly

7640782 well we have a very good poll today we are tied in gallup applause and so pplease have no doubt we are the underdog in this race we will be the underdog until the pols close and we will have a tough headwind in this fight in this race do not have any doubt aobut it but i also want to look you in the eye and i appreciate your generosity but i also want to tell ya we will compete in the state of california we will compete and win in the state of california we will not just come take your money and leave
7640783 i was a little bit disappointed in not being able to introduce cindy as was originally planned as she is a beer heiress and im irish catholic laughter i have a vested interest in seeing her becoming first lady so i get invited to those white house keg parties
7640784 you know that we have as our candidate a man who has endured years of torture and abuse in the service of our country and even before harry reid he was a prisoner of war in vietnam
7640785 giving his blessing in messianic fashion to thousands of adoring germans
7640786 you know what i thought when i saw that photo i thought yeah baby we are going to win this election because i am in the cheese aisle in the grocery store a lot more often than when i am in berlin and so are most other americans
7640787 as an actor i recognize that our opponent someone who thinks that if he puts on the right costume and stands on the right set that we will all believe that he is presidential material but john mccain doesnt have to pretend because he walks the walk
7640788 they hate me they hate the f o b and i dont blame them i hate me too
7640789 the notion of linear television news is antithetical to the web a distinctly non linear vod environment the notion of waiting until 6 30pm or 10pm to get the breaking news story is simply a non starter in the web world

7640794 we are a party and a country that welcomes freedom of expression
7640795 i wish all these people who have all these concerns about foreign policy would get out there and use their energy to support barack obama
7640796 i come back and keep reading because youre a unique voice doing actual investigative reporting and arent afraid to question the status quo cleantech coms reporting has unique perspectives
7640797 this is a way to tap into that audience and get their input
7640798 it would be the coolest experience and ill come up with killer questions for him
7640799 can physician written blogs meet legal and ethical professionalism standards
7640800 medical blogs moderated with attention to civil and open discussion among the visitors and following guidelines for ethical operations make a significant contribution to the medical education of the public and i dare say the profession
7640801 physician blogs should not be seen as an attempt to replace other sources of information but instead as a new kind of medium a view into the minds of the rank and file members of medicine
7640802 if he wants to sh on hip hop thats cool with me

7640846 mostly cubans are frustrated alienated and hopeless and the new generations demotivated do not feel the same commitment as earlier ones to this poor and without perspective socialism that is so far away from expectations
7640847 in order to save the people the homeland and the revolution we need a new socialist programme participative and democratic that is capable of offering constructive solutions

7640862 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7640863 she was perfectly willing to help treat guadalupes infertility restoring a natural function of the body but she had qualms about impregnating which is basically what the doctor does in these situations a woman without a husband
7640864 we are not talking here about necessary medical care but an elective procedure artificial insemination that is obviously fraught with moral issues which are necessarily different from say the decision to have your appendix removed or a knee replaced
7640865 the sexual liberty at stake in this case was not the right of an individual to live as one chooses to be free from bullying fear and harassment it was the right to be protected by the government from the knowledge that one of your fellow citizens disagrees with some of the choices you have made
7640866 i understand that irrational prejudices must be contained and stigmatized if we are to have a decent society i do not understand how any decent society can deem a moral reluctance to create a fatherless child a hateful and irrational prejudice that must be stamped out

7640892 with ten returning field reps these 50 are the best trained and best equipped representatives weve ever had and theyre ready to take college campuses by storm this fall
7640893 these campuses have a large population of hispanic students statistically hispanics in this area tend to vote for leftist candidates but they also tend to support pro life policies i hope to focus my efforts on starting pro life groups on these campuses and plan to use this demographic tendency to reach out and recruit hispanic students for this cause
7640894 im really excited because i think a lot of students sense theres more at stake than usual
7640895 this being an election year i think people will want to be more involved because they are familiar with the candidates that seems to be the vibe im getting here
7640896 being politically active at the university of central florida as an undergrad gave me a passion for spreading the conservative message
7640897 every day we encountered hostility from the far left they constantly protested bush or the war they yelled and called us names it fired me up and made me realize i was doing something right those experiences showed me what i want to do for my career
7640898 i want the students to know i was in their shoes three to four years ago trying to recruit conservatives on campus the leadership institute taught me how to organize and how to lead and now i want to teach those skills to college students across the country
7640899 if we reach college students and get them active and nurture their conservative beliefs now it will likely stay with them the rest of their lives
7640900 i have my work cut out for me on these campuses
7640901 washington is a very liberal state but i have a feeling this strong opposition will embolden conservatives on campus this election season

7640910 the council of ministers expressed its extreme sorrow for loss of so many civilian lives during recent air raids in herat laghman kapisa paktika kunar and nurestan and condemned the casualties inflicted on civilians
7640911 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7640912 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7640913 in 2001 there was a different afghanistan today there is a government and a parliament the situation has evolved and it is just about time

7640927 taxes are the price we pay because we are not entirely civilized
7640928 taxes are in fact a reflection of our failure to achieve a fully civilized society
7640929 civilized people get what they want by voluntary means through persuasion or exchange the use of force to acquire property is uncivilized and the history of civilization is the history of limitations on the use of force

7640932 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business
7640933 our goal with these new mobile services is to give quickbooks online users the edge they need to compete and manage their busy lives by keeping tabs on their business even when they are out of the office
7640934 given the virtual nature of our interactions iphone support helps us be more productive
7640935 while waiting for an appointment i was able to check quickbooks online using my iphone to look up parents with open balances and send them an e mail reminder to pay their bill
7640936 generally we are seeing greater penetration of smartphone users in the united states people who have smartphones do a lot more on the mobile web
7640937 banks are becoming more aggressive launching mobile access to their services so there is a demand for a service like quickbooks online for mobile
7640938 dont you think it is a bit disingenuous for mrs clinton to start complaining that the mccain ad is trying to be divisive
7640939 and so tolerance is being redefined so when many people say practice tolerance what they are saying is that to believe that everyones religious beliefs are true as long as it true to them and that all life style and behavior choice are valid as long as it feels right for the individual
7640940 during the ice storm in 1998 i was a red cross volunteer i went into neighborhoods on a red cross truck handing out water
7640941 these sailors have worked hard and are all eager to assist the red cross in providing a safe shelter during fay
7640942 the red cross in northwest florida is fortunate to have such a strong partnership with the local military commands whenever we request volunteers the answer is always how can we help
7640943 this americorps group steps up every time and we are very grateful
7640944 its a good way to get involved and learn more about the community
7640945 as the media theorist marshall mcluhan pointed out in the 1960s media are not just passive channels of information they supply the stuff of thought but they also shape the process of thought and what the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski

7640947 here is a book to put melody into the way we live the christian life
7640948 what is it that people dont believe i was in special forces
7640949 oh its not personal thats just not something anyone is going to believe you wouldnt believe it yourself
7640950 say youre sitting in a bar and some guy say yeah i used to be with the cia are you going to believe him
7640951 no but i have worked with the cia and if i were one of them well whod even admit that
7640952 okay so you would not believe them and what happens to you is the same thing
7640953 doesnt matter if a person was in any one of the those places and claimed they used to work undercover for the cia theyd not be believed see what i mean has nothing to do with you do you want to hear more want to hear what other things people think of you these are normal people now just normal people people like me unless they happen to find out different
7640954 well first like you say they dont believe you but lets say they do believe you they find out some kind of way that you were in special forces they still dont think you killed anyone
7640955 they think you were in special forces this does not mean you killed anyone you might have its possible that in more than a decade in sf you might have killed someone maybe maybe but if you did it would be no more than one person thats it
7640956 p thats like learning to be a machinist and making one part
7640957 yeah i know but i am telling you this is how people think maybe you killed someone you might have killed one person maybe this is what people thought when i first started writing about you on my blog they said it right in the comments
7640958 im not are you kidding me i was with an artist before you and people liked it just fine they had no idea what to make of the new development but heres the amazing part here is the amusing part if you come right out and tell them you killed someone they will go right back to non believing that bastard said he killed someone but i bet he didnt that guy never killed anyone
7640959 yes there is no way your average person is going to hang around you and not throw up some kind of denial
7640960 when someones does believe me guess what the first thing they want to know is
7640961 well i guarantee you if you tell them you did theyre going to smile and walk away and say that guy didnt kill anyone hes a lying bastard they just really dont want this in their head
7640962 injecting fresh blood will make sure there is competition for places

7640967 theres an element of kedusha holiness playing in the shul and i like that the audiences here are completely quiet
7640968 hes interested in everything and ultimately it all finds a place in his own music
7640969 hes a forward looking guy and once hes played something hes on to the next thing
7640970 hes not going to change his artistic vision so he can have a hit record or better paying gig he certainly isnt going to do something some record producer tells him to do hes certainly not looking to make a commercial record
7640971 if you take out weekends youre not going to really work that much thats when the big gigs are in this business thats like giving up 50 60 of your work more than that
7640972 so we have no arrangements no sets we all know the melodies and we just play them and see where they go
7640973 total dismay as the sun passed away and the days were black as night

7640975 the scope of the original book that this is based on was quite amazing
7640976 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
7640977 fox was sending lawyers who were only looking at all the commas and the dots they made everything difficult from a to z
7640978 i know what i had i had something much better in my hands but i just wasnt allowed to work
7640979 i dont see how people who went through all these amazing blockbusters like the dark knight and iron man this summer will take it

7640994 externalities in the classroom how children exposed to domestic violence affect everyones kids

7641004 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test

7641099 as we gather here in denver to nominate barack obama and u s sen joe biden we also celebrate those two historic grassroots campaigns that attracted million of new voters in places like ohio and pennsylvania we also celebrate the work all of you have down and will do to achieve that goal
7641100 after the nominee was chosen massachusetts delegates unified around barack obama we are now fully mobilized as a coordinated campaign
7641101 the republicans are hard at work and they are trying to use us to beat us
7641102 i have talked to any number of clinton supporters both before and since the primary here in our delegation and elsewhere and i havent met a one yet that didnt believe that the course that we are on today is not good enough for the american people or that the course that we would be on with presumptive republican nominee john mccain would be wrong for america

7641111 i am happy that i can pursue both of my dreams to perform in adult movies and open my own restaurant at the same time
7641112 anyone who has been in the adult business knows how hard it is to find people who are genuine
7641113 the people honored have stood by me through highs and lows and i wanted to recognize them for the quality individuals there are both on and off camera
7641114 we will serve everything from a real boston steak and cheese to a chicken salad sandwich we will have hamburgers beer battered mushrooms and for those with a sweet tooth boston cream pie and cheesecake
7641115 there will be a lot of attention but i dont think it will cause a change in policy
7641116 its as tragic at 99 as it is at 101
7641117 heres a u n sanctioned mission carried out by nato and you still have people referring to it as bushs war and were the lackeys of the americans
7641118 its a big number and its growing every time i come to the bridge i always wish it was my last but you know in the back of your mind that its not going to be the last
7641119 its the least that i can do for these guys who are giving their lives
7641120 canadians are traditionally peacekeepers and so for us to lose that many its hard
7641121 there are signs of lingering deep bitterness between the obama and clinton camps
7641122 the new design will signify the green highway of the future as the new system aims to lower emissions we want to have entire fleet of these at some point
7641123 the first buses did not have radios or heat these new buses are cadillacs compared to the old ones we have come a long way in terms of routes as we work our way into subdivisions we used to just have one bus that went straight up the hart highway to chief lake you had to endure the entire ride to get into town

7641128 once i arrived at uconn for the summer semester i just saw what was going to be required every day and i thought i wouldnt be able to give that
7641129 its been going on for a while with me it didnt just happen over night it built up i just know when i step on the basketball floor now i feel burnout its nothing in particular its just the game im tired of it and that feeling might even go back to when i was 15 years old
7641130 if i was going to play basketball i would be at uconn
7641131 to avoid future questions about basketball it would be ridiculous for me to say never but basketball is not a part of my life right now i am at ease being at the university of delaware its incredible ive been all smiles since ive been here and i hope it continues that way
7641132 everyone else was upset about it and all i could think was how to do you think i feel to be given this god given talent and not put forth the effort i had to do it maybe ive over killed the sport a little maybe taking time off will help me maybe not
7641133 yeah thats um high the highest weve ever scored on a digital title
7641134 and while its great to have my first title be not only a critically acclaimed one but also a financial success there is a bigger picture at play here that we need to look at consumers voted with their dollars they basically have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right
7641135 basically we have set a standard in digital gaming the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7641136 good reader pass over the market opportunity to make yourself up and allow grace to do it for you in the way the redemptive creator more intimate to you than you are to yourself knows how this is the wider room into which the saints and mystics of the church invite you where not even the sky is the limit

7641139 the party is still proud of its fiscal direction in the clinton years
7641140 barack obama feels obliged to pay lip service to it but there is no sense that this is the highest priority
7641141 americans should be prepared to raise the taxes invest in productivity and create the jobs but they cant support that theyd rather cut taxes invest in defense and build jails
7641142 aku suka dia karena orangnya cuek aku juga jadi cocok
7641143 soal iman soal pribadi lah nggak usah menjadi urusan publik
7641144 mom i think we should say that the peanut butter is the ants poop
7641145 coming into a new situation i wanted to be the leader that i can be
7641146 thats all i can do thats what im focusing on doing
7641147 we worked hard against one another and tried to make each other better were both competitors we both want to get out there and win and help our team win
7641148 thats been my whole thought process through the bye week of doing what i can do to be better
7641149 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7641150 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7641151 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7641152 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7641153 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7641154 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7641155 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7641156 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7641157 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7641158 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7641159 while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation
7641160 it was a pleasure and privilege to work on the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
7641161 there was a funny and kind of surreal moment during the initial casting process when i had to introduce the u s voice actress wendee lee to aya hirano who played the lead role in the original japanese version and also to patty lee who played haruhi in the bandai usa produced asos brigade videos i was faced with three haruhis and for a moment i felt like i was in the anime itself kind of in this other dimension where the time continuum was broken it was a funny haruhi moment
7641162 there is always a moment during the casting process when the character stops being merely animated and the voice actor brings that persona to life the way an actor portrays certain emotions with confidence and believability lets me know they have an intrinsic understanding of a particular characters personality and motivations
7641163 many of these series have a ton of incidentals and bit parts and they take a lot of time to cast you cant bring in individuals to play each and every bit so you have to make casting decisions in a way that is not only best for the role no matter how small but also makes sure that actors dont end up talking to themselves on screen its not always easy to do and demands a solid understanding of both the original japanese version as well as whats required for the new north american dub
7641164 recognition like this is very gratifying and shows how much the fans and industry support the job we did on the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
7641165 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7641166 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7641167 the whole week is going to be a do nothing week

7641241 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice

7641243 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7641244 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7641245 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7641246 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7641247 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7641248 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7641249 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7641250 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us

7641259 at the beginning of the year premier wen jiabao said it was going to be a difficult year and he wasnt kidding next year is going to be even more difficult
7641260 they were an attempt to change the way the world thinks about china and i think they have accomplished that
7641261 after theyre over i think china has to get back to the hard work of truly developing an economy and society that can participate as an equal partner on the world stage but with the olympics i think they will have gained a lot of respect from observers around the world and now need to implement plans to justify that respect
7641262 if you have increased buying power among chinese consumers youre going to have more advertising and a higher level of media expenditures
7641263 those three companies will benefit and its interesting that in the u s theres three of anything that provides exposure to the chinese consumer
7641264 its definitely true that theres been increased government willingness to protect chinese exporting firms and take targeted measures to protect gdp growth numbers

7641272 its kind of a hallow just not being there opening up a classroom for the first time in 30 years and seeing the new little faces coming into the classroom and saying hi to the teacher you know

7641318 i have called captain nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far will earn one of his two wildcard picks

7641445 renowned for making women look beautiful he sees them as art
7641446 a master of the art of astonishment thompsons images are witty surprising and indelible though he says hes open to collaborative improvisation thompsons spontaneity is always channeled into pictures so carefully and elegantly composed that nothing is irrelevant nothing wasted even the most outrageous feel somehow understated if theres a sensibility that connects thompsons photographs its flexible nimble fearless and hard to define except as consummate skill

7641448 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7641449 you know obama will be strong on foreign aid because his grandmother still lives in a poor village in kenya
7641450 and you know hell be a strong fiscal conservative because shes still there
7641451 that all of them may be one father just as you are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me
7641452 i tried to reach out to the guy i knew something was wrong i smelled a fish
7641453 they used to contain basically the address and perhaps logs from calls they made to the call center now whole phone conversations are logged as well as faxes and letters that are scanned together with images and video that is available
7641454 if you ever want to get anywhere in politics my boy youre going to have to get a toehold in the public eye
7641455 i was very impressed by him i think he has great size great length good shooting touch good ball handler good vision good pace i was surprised at his size right off the top he was able to handle the ball i tried to test him a little bit see if he could go left go right that sort of thing so i like him
7641456 no 9 sun is the best player in chinas backcourt
7641457 he is very quick very athletic very talented he can shoot and i think he can really play
7641458 les axes sur lesquels ils seront invit s n gocier

7641463 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7641464 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7641465 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7641466 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7641467 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7641468 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7641469 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7641470 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7641471 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7641472 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7641473 make the switch to greenpower and make virtually no difference to your carbon emissions
7641474 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
7641475 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
7641476 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
7641477 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
7641478 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
7641479 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships
7641480 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7641481 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7641482 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7641483 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7641484 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7641485 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7641486 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7641487 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7641488 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7641489 ldl cholesterol levels below 2 80 mmol l and levels of at least 3 90 mmol l were both associated with markedly elevated risk of cancer among patients who did not use statins
7641490 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7641491 low serum cholesterol is commonly observed in individuals with ill health e g cancer patients and those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as smoking and heavy drinking
7641492 the world is an ultra technological place and super sexualized but people dont really know what to do with their bodies
7641493 we loved the attitude and we identified with the d i y side of the scene
7641494 you sort of lose your identity but at the same time youre so connected to your roots that something strange happens in your head
7641495 were playing with the clich of being the savage brazilian
7641496 we celebrate the fact that we are seen by others as savages
7641497 it may be safe for women who have taken oral anticoagulants for 5 7 months after an unprovoked venous thromboembolism to discontinue therapy if they have 0 or 1 of the following 1 hyperpigmentation brown discoloration edema swelling or redness of either leg 2 a d dimer level blood clotting test of 250ug l or more while taking warfarin 3 bmi body mass index 30kg m2 and aged 65 years or more
7641498 it appears all men are at high risk of recurrence
7641499 the land is in musaffah and we will start building in the next six to eight months
7641500 the mormons also hope to be allocated land in dubai soon and in sharjah in the near future
7641501 we havent yet been allotted land in dubai but we expect to
7641502 i ve talked with staff and we all agree that because of the cost of things from diesel fuel to gasoline to home heating fuel that we have more volatility built into this forecast than we have seen in many years
7641503 clearly departments are going to be expected to mitigate to the extent that s reasonably possible energy costs
7641504 there s two factors that will make the difference in determining the surplus one of course is energy price revenues and the second is the commitment of the government to make sure that our expenditures remain under control
7641505 when energy prices go up the royalties go up a lot and the cost of running the government goes up a little
7641506 in contrast high energy prices are a disaster for the people of nova scotia
7641507 last year we ended up with 300 million at the end of the year when in december they were very close to going into deficit
7641508 they should be able to do a better job in my view of projecting some of these rising energy costs
7641509 it s what makes quebec attractive in terms of investment
7641510 for us this is a first major step in an area where we want to intensify and develop our capacity as a place in the world that is renowned for clean renewable energy
7641511 our operation in becancour could be very significant and this site has the potential to support our proposed growth plans for quite some time in the future
7641512 one should never preclude future potential expansion but we have to come back to that later to make our decision
7641513 its my belief well need two weeks of practice with jerry before he can play in a game
7641514 if he doesnt practice this week i would say i would hold him out of the opener
7641515 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
7641516 we like his instincts and his ability to run a team he also puts a lot of pressure on the ball defensively we thank d j for his contributions and wish him well
7641517 your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to you
7641518 here are my mother and my brothers 50 for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
7641519 were getting back to a more average type of production after a couple of years of fairly hot dry conditions in parts of the prairies
7641520 rains have certainly hurt the harvest on the wheat crop in terms of quality rendered probably some of it unsuitable for milling
7641521 the only concerns this year are more on the quality side
7641522 our expectation is that prices will stay up for those commodities a little bit more than for the wheats that have been downgraded to the feed level
7641523 there are many costs in the food chain the biggest thing is what is going to happen to the cost of energy
7641524 even if you do get average crops or slightly above average crops the fundamentals are not going to go away
7641525 the demand for a lot of these commodity grains is going to continue if not grow and the supply is going to either maintain roughly where it is or possibly even shrink
7641526 you have to remember thats only slightly and its still going to be at near record lows in terms of stock to use relationships
7641527 youve seen the input costs go up but not everyone of the processors has passed through the complete input cost increases
7641528 as a consequence we havent yet seen the full effect at the supermarket or at the restaurant level
7641529 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7641530 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7641531 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7641532 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7641533 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7641535 all original oak detail the foyer boasts beamed ceilings fluted columns a window seat two tiffany stained glass windows and a fireplace
7641536 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7641537 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7641538 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7641539 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity
7641540 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7641541 in my opinion my iphone has worked perfectly the only time a call has been disconnected was on the train to stockholm and that has happened with other mobiles as well but when i on the evening before the test looked at the signal strength bars and compared with a nokia the iphone looked pretty bad several bars less and often preferring to switch to edge
7641542 i seek at the beginning to get my heart into such a state that it has no will of its own in regard to a given matter
7641543 having done this i do not leave the result to feeling or simple impression if i do so i make myself liable to great delusions
7641544 i see the will of the spirit of god through or in connection with the word of god the spirit and the word must be combined if i look to the spirit alone without the word i lay myself open to great delusions also if the holy spirit guides us at all he will do it according to the scriptures and never contrary to them
7641545 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
7641546 i take into account providential circumstances these often plainly indicate gods will in connection with his word and spirit
7641547 i ask god in prayer to reveal his will to me aright
7641548 thus through prayer to god the study of the word and revlection i come to a deliberate judgment according to the best of my ability and knowledge and if my mind is thus at peace and continues so after tow or three more petitions i proceed accordingly in trivial matters and in transactions involving more important issues i have found this method always effective
7641549 rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your gentleness be evident to all the lord is near do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus

7641597 its been over four months since the country is being led by a resigning government which lacks legitimacy to address the problems
7641598 we launched a series of protests in april because the price of rice and other food products were too high but prices have doubled since then

7641600 wed been hunting for a long time and during the day i got one pig which weighed about 50kg and i had that on my back

7641602 the last thing i remember is falling at speed with the weight of the pig and hitting the rock headfirst

7641623 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7641624 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7641625 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7641626 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles

7641648 geoff has been a video game journalist since he was 14 years old and the face of video game programming on spike for several years
7641649 his passion knowledge and point of view that are key to our ongoing success make him the perfect choice to broaden and deepen our relationships with publishers in his new role geoff will keep the gaming industry more connected to spike and spike more connected to the gaming audience we couldnt be more thrilled to expand his position at the network and continue to build upon our success with gamers
7641650 video games are an integral part of the spike tv brand and what better person to helm our video game programming and serve as a liaison between the network and publishers than geoff keighley one of the most respected names in the business
7641651 the passion geoff has for video games coupled with his vast knowledge and experience in covering the video game industry makes him the obvious choice

7641653 as the report indicates in order to really provide a complete picture of health information technology hospitals have to bring in multiple systems
7641654 we looked at 16 systems in this report and although hospitals are at different places some have implemented all 16 some have implemented 10 and some five there are really no hospitals in the state that are not working on this journey

7641656 we figure once its here it will take care of itself
7641657 i think its great that the wha is collecting this data and i agree that hit system use in wisconsin hospitals including rural hospitals is certainly increasing
7641658 there is a difference in rates of adoption between small and large hospitals however

7641862 real courage is when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway
7641863 its our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities

7641872 we were used to the idea that authorities would stall on permits but i think some of us thought that the permits would come through at the end so we went forward
7641873 when the week started there were only 600 or 700 people in the park
7641874 it grew to about 10 000 nearly all of them from chicago
7641875 next thing we knew we were being kicked being pulled apart and some very racial statements being made and then i looked up and when i looked up thats when i got hit i still have the scar right here
7641876 i remember feeling that warm wet stuff on my face and i was bleeding
7641877 we were talking while we were on our way there about the assassination of robert kennedy the assassination of martin luther king jr we talked about the vietnam war
7641878 we just felt nobody was listening to us at that time anyway and we wanted to just have our say or at least be part of something
7641879 now theyre moving in the cops are moving and they are really belting these characters theyre grabbing them sticks are flailing people are laying on the ground i can see them colored people cops are just belting them cops are just laying it in theres piles of bodies on the street theres no question about it you can hear the screams and theres a guy theyre just dragging along the street and they dont care i dont think i dont know if hes alive or dead holy jesus look at him five of them are belting him really oh this man will never get up
7641880 the reason were protesting is because mr obamas reputation as a progressive is not really deserved
7641881 for example his so called anti war stance involves a program to remove combat troops from iraq over a period of 16 months the majority of american people want those troops removed immediately as soon as possible
7641882 people can go and come as they like the other thing that we are doing in the demonstration zone is to provide a stage and speakers and microphone so that they can be heard at a greater distance
7641883 and thats the citys role finding a balance between safety and security and the rights of those who would come and want to raise their voices
7641884 i dont mean to exaggerate but it is the end of freedom this is the freedom to protest as designed for you by any authoritarian state under the direction of the police
7641885 what 1968 demonstrated was that protest could be an effective tactic for bringing about social change
7641886 so important new protest tactics were invented the sit in the large demonstration and people learned that this was a way they could effectively influence the government

7641968 ik wilde de sluitingsceremonie in peking bekijken in mijn gedachten ben ik nog steeds daar
7641969 als je in rusland mensen op straat vraagt wat een grandslamtoernooi is blijven velen je het antwoord schuldig maar als je vraagt wat de olympische spelen zijn kan iedereen je het antwoord geven het is het grootste toernooi ter wereld soms kan ik nog niet geloven dat ik goud gewonnen heb
7641970 we hadden niet gedacht dat het zo druk zou zijn het hele stadion helemaal oranje dat is echt zo gaaf zo cool
7641971 dat wordt me al drie dagen gevraagd maar ik denk dat ik nog wel een paar weken nodig heb om het te beseffen
7641972 ik ben nu vooral blij met mijn medaille want ik ben toch gewoon olympisch kampioen

7641987 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
7641988 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
7641989 for us giving food to the dragons is an obligation our sacred duty
7641990 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
7641991 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
7641992 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
7641993 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
7641994 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
7641995 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child
7641996 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
7641997 i dont blame the dragons for my boys death i blame those who forbade us from following custom and feeding them
7641998 if it werent for them my boy would still be alive
7641999 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
7642000 youve got to be very careful about extrapolating and drawing any conclusions
7642001 any concern expressed by the villagers will be taken seriously and we will address it if we can
7642002 the smell of the village goats chicken drying fish all this invites the dragons
7642003 and if the dragons cant grab the animals they will bite the villagers

7642005 of course every now and then youll have an accident but nothing significant you have your fender benders but thats about all
7642006 what we try to do is educate them we tell them to slow down and wear your seat belts
7642007 its not a rite of passage its really a privilege and its important for parents to talk with them about the responsibility that is required to get behind the wheel
7642008 from what weve studied we do know that teens do listen to their parents when it comes to driving and driving safety
7642009 do they pay attention to the things that are asked of them are they ready mentally to handle the responsibility of driving the vehicle
7642010 hes a pretty good driver hes all the time telling me how to drive
7642011 it not really much of a difference ive become atuned to driving so much that i can stay focused it doesnt matter who is in the car
7642012 do you usually find this a problem at the beginning of school years
7642013 no people are pretty you know you give them a letter some of them are belligerent and theyll throw it away or stuff like that but most of the time theyll take it and just heed our warning
7642014 every tax dollar that we collect 65 of it goes to the schools so if you dont register your car youre really only hurting your child nothing else

7642016 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
7642017 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
7642018 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7642019 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7642020 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
7642021 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7642022 scientists have been so preoccupied with creating a barcode of life that they have not been careful in monitoring the accuracy of the underlying data

7642045 the central government is beyond the point where it is satisfied merely with a wait and see attitude now we re seeing some action

7642053 we dont really have a stationary house because we travel a lot and in our 13 years doing so this is the best place weve been to
7642054 we have a lot of folks who will ask if we have internet access
7642055 if its down people definitely come and let us know
7642056 we have started the process and weve got seven parks now that are wireless
7642057 our goal is to add more and more and its been very successful
7642058 what were trying to say is come on over to one of our parks and youll be able to connect to the wireless world but also at the same time walk away from the computer and get reconnected to the natural world
7642059 its part of the way this generation is geared and the computer is one of the things people bring with them everywhere
7642060 we have computers here so people come in to use them when they want to know more information about the park
7642061 we rarely see people using the service but when people use the center for large meetings or when we had a large class from out of state stay overnight they all brought their own computers and used the wireless internet
7642062 we arent sure if we will ever be able to expand the service
7642063 we thought it would be good for parents and visitors over at the other end of the park near the splash pad to work while their children play
7642064 in these three communications the president expressed his concern at the latest developments in the doha round

7642071 you know when president bush coming off his 04 win came in and said were going to privatize social security im really proud that i was one of the leaders who said no were not going to let that happen you may have this new capital because youre now the re elected president but this is a fight worth having were not going to let this occur so when i hear senator obama talk about that i wonder which fights he wouldnt fight would he have not fought to get to a balanced budget and a surplus and help create 22 million new jobs would he have not fought to get assault weapons off the street and get them out of the hands of you know criminals and gang members you never hear the specifics its all this kind of abstract general talk about how we all need to get along i want to get along and i have gotten along in the senate i will work with republicans to find common cause whenever i can but i will also stand my ground because there are fights worth having universal health care is a fight worth having senator obama has decided it isnt he wont present a plan for universal health care thats a big difference between he and i and its a big difference between me and the republican party
7642072 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7642073 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama and his dealings with mr rezko
7642074 and in fact you know our financial situation has probably has been more investigated than anybody whos ever been in public life in america we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama and his dealings with mr rezko so i dont mind answering questions but i find it only fair that we have questions going to the other side as well and i dont see that happening you know we have been on the front line of full disclosure ive been examined one side up and the other side down im more than happy to have that but i think its fair that we have the same standards apply to my opponent
7642075 there has been a relentless series of attacks coming from the other side senator obamas campaign has become increasingly negative
7642076 there has been a relentless series of attacks coming from the other side ive spent the vast majority of this campaign giving very specific speeches about the solutions that i offer on all of the important issues facing our country and in fact the press that covers me on a regular basis i think is kind of bored because i just talk about solutions and what were going to do to get more jobs and get health care for everyone and make sure we have a clean renewable energy future and all of the other concerns that voters talk to me about but in the last you know couple of weeks senator obamas campaign has become increasingly negative he says one thing on the stump and his campaign does something else
7642077 the jewel exporters are now exploring russia china and west asia markets to meet their exports targets apart from this the jewellery manufacturing segment has also witnessed a two per cent decline during april july 2008
7642078 to achieve exponential growth in the export of gem and jewellery we need to broaden its definition we have demanded that the union commerce ministry include luxury goods such as watches dresses sarees and other accessories in the gem and jewellery segment
7642079 if this amendment is made then luxury goods could be manufactured at special economic zones sez that will boost exports many european brands like morellato and stiffen hafner have shown interest in investing in india if these products come under purv iew of gem and jewellery
7642080 if the ambit of the gem and jewellery is extended to luxury goods it would help to grow the industry the industry will be able to provide more jobs as well
7642081 we are hoping that the demand for gem and jewellery from the us and europe will increase during christmas if everything goes well the gems and jewellery industry will be able to attain a growth rate of 15 per cent

7642149 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect
7642150 what the united states is talking about is integrating the missions they recognize that there are serious difficulties arising because there are two separate missions in afghanistan now and have been from the beginning operation enduring freedom oef and the international security assistance force right now there are two americans in command of both and what they are talking about is integrating the bulk of the american troops who are in operation enduring freedom
7642151 canadians are rather conflicted about why theyre in afghanistan some people saw this as an apology for not going to iraq and some people actually genuinely think that being in afghanistan is about helping the afghan people and if thats your position then id think this is all good because its going to be more help and more substantive help

7642278 once the information was online experts estimate that it would take less than an hour to write and run a software bot a simple computer program capable of harvesting every record on best westerns european reservation system
7642279 there was one instance of suspicious activity at a single hotel with respect to 13 guests who are being notified we are working with the fbi and international authorities to investigate the source of the other claims which were never presented to us for investigation prior to publication of the herald story we have found no suspicious activity to support them

7642282 as a dog returns to his vomit so a dullard repeats his folly
7642283 if we just focus on the religious element adding biden to the democratic ticket was an extremely smart move
7642284 biden has ties in a very important swing state pennsylvania where catholics are the biggest constituency whose votes are up for grabs
7642285 there is a broader group of catholics who have pro life sympathies but who dont vote exclusively on that issue and in that case biden may be an appealing candidate
7642286 and the fact that he has opposed late term abortions gives him some talking points which obama doesnt have
7642287 where the catholic vote could make a real difference are florida ohio and louisiana
7642288 as a dog returns to his vomit so a dullard repeats his folly
7642289 i think if helio wins the next two we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7642290 it was a pretty straightforward race in the sense that this is the order that we had in qualifying and it seems to reflect the performances in the race
7642291 i had a great start i just think i kept my position and followed my line but unfortunately i was radioed immediately halfway through the first lap to relinquish that position and give it back to matos so i went wide in the last corner the rest was pretty good at the end the pace was good i also managed to post my fastest lap with three to go
7642292 it was so far the toughest race of the championship
7642293 i had a clearly quicker car than richard but he never gave me any space i needed to make a pass
7642294 youre not allowed to block and he blocked me four or five times he just didnt give me enough room he completely brake checked me going into turn 11 and i had nowhere to go
7642295 unfortunately we hit each other i am 100 percent sure that it wasnt my fault im sorry that i hit him but youre not allowed to block
7642296 in the backstraight matos went to the outside and cut the track so he came out right behind by cutting the track
7642297 thats how he gained the advantage i chose the inside from the beginning knowing that he was right on my tail and i would get passed i cant bank on having the race review that later on so i defended my position from the inside and he choose the outside and then back inside and just lifted me in the air and pushed me off i lost two places im ok a little bruised but im ok
7642298 i think this whole afs andretti green team deserved to leave here with the points lead and that is where were at heading to chicago
7642299 i havent committed any sort of firearms offences they have seized a cigarette lighter that looks like a 38 calibre gun and they tried to link it to a home invasion or an armed robbery that i had nothing to do with
7642300 it looks like a gun it doesnt fire bullets you squeeze the trigger and flames come out it could have singed someones curtains thats about all
7642301 why didnt they get him when it is said to have happened in early august

7642328 the difference between us and them supermarkets is that we pick up our produce every morning
7642329 some stores are busier than others and might get deliveries daily others get a delivery every few days
7642330 things like fruit and veg are incredibly competitive markets so prices may vary from store to store depending on supply and demand and where the produce comes from
7642331 we work hard to ensure our prices are competitive at every store be that with other supermarkets or with greengrocers
7642332 its not in anybodys interest not to maintain the freshest produce
7642333 they are working on eye appeal and theres sometimes issues about what its like to eat and the taste but those are very hard things to measure

7642343 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7642344 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall

7642350 well get calls from adult children cleaning out their parents closets or letters from guilt stricken seniors who want to return items to the hotel
7642351 we want people to know that its ok we forgive you wed just like to have these items back so we can document the peabodys history through its artifacts and share her story with future generations

7642353 when you travel you experience in a very practical way the act of rebirth
7642354 you confront completely new situations the day passes more slowly and on most journeys you dont even understand the language the people speak you are like a child just out of the womb
7642355 it is very important to pay attention to the road it is the road that teaches us the best way to get there and the road enriches us as we walk its length
7642356 and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour
7642357 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice
7642358 throughout it all the challengers legal team consisted primarily of the three undersigned attorneys with occasional support from a small handful of others allworking on a pro bono basis
7642359 who also personally bore all the expenses of the litigation
7642360 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other

7642365 with the election of the national chairman of the mdc tsvangirai as speaker the people have spoken again they want a change nobody can or will dictate to zimbabweans
7642366 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7642367 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7642368 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7642369 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations
7642370 mr shuah mudiwa has been released but the honourable elia jembere is still detained but we dont know where
7642371 we have published a list of eight mps elect who are wanted in connection with various cases including public violence
7642372 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7642373 by the conlanging community we at the conlang wikibook want to help you make the language that youd like to make not the one that you already speak
7642374 we are reviewing the performance of all routes and have yet to make a conclusion
7642375 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7642376 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7642377 its got all of the hallmarks of the way prime minister mr kevin rudd operates
7642378 you come up with some sort of media driven stunt to start a particular series of otherwise unpleasant political events
7642379 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7642380 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7642381 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7642382 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7642383 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7642384 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7642385 were reviewing our entire relationship with russia both for the medium term and the long term
7642386 no question that russia has not lived up to the ceasefire agreement
7642387 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7642388 i spoke with chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus
7642389 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7642390 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists
7642391 in all the inspections we have not detected any problem that affects security or a link with cost cutting policies
7642392 the airline put pressure on mechanics for them to authorise planes to take off even if they were not ready
7642393 flights and planes are absolutely safe and respect all operational security standards
7642394 at spanair no pilot faces pressure to fly a plane that does not meet all the standards of operational security
7642395 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7642396 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7642397 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe

7642406 vernon and i were talking about how some things have not really changed
7642407 there are three places we learned the classroom the laboratories and the library and most of all the residence halls
7642408 there are wonderful design features to bring students together and provide the opportunity for them to be separate
7642409 he has decided to transfer nick is a fine young man who did an outstanding job here for us
7642410 we certainly hate to see him leave the program because every characteristic every value we try to instill in the program he certainly represents great team player
7642411 we decided that darrah and star jackson would be the two guys we used to compete for the third quarterback
7642412 i think that was a little bit frustrating to nick in terms of ok where is my future here if thats the case
7642413 if we lost a tackle in the clemson game we would move him out to tackle rather than playing one of the young guys right now
7642414 i made a mistake im sorry for what i did
7642415 it was an accident of course id take it back if i could but i believe in coach randy shannon coach shannon said i need to do this its best for the team so its what im going to do
7642416 im proud to be here i messed up he didnt mess up i messed up im having a great time playing out here on scout team a great time with everything im taking it very well it is what it is i talked to my parents im taking the most positive way out of this
7642417 were not playing the gators were playing charleston southern so thats where my focus is
7642418 i knew what the rules were i violated them im just another player on the team

7642420 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7642421 men choose women for four reasons for their money for their rank for their beauty and for their religion but marry one who is religious and you will succeed
7642422 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7642423 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7642424 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7642425 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7642426 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7642427 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7642428 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7642429 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7642430 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7642431 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7642432 oh it just takes me a little while to warm up but once i get going i usually have a lot to say
7642433 i can look you in the eyes and tell you everything is on track

7642440 physical education and sport are elements of culture for all citizens contributing to their physical and intellectual development
7642441 art culture sport and tourism are integral parts of the scientific and technical revolution and contribute to the development of the personality
7642442 every citizen has a right to physical education and sport
7642443 in the ddr the programme of socialism corresponds to the interests of the workers and the youth this makes it possible to satisfy their desire to practice physical education and sport in a new socialist way for the benefit of the people as a whole
7642444 otherwise there is a danger that children will become interested in subjects or get into circles that have nothing to do with sport
7642445 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7642446 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7642447 whenever we have an officer charged with some kind of criminal offense immediately what well do is well serve him with a 10 day administrative leave with pay pending the investigation

7642449 really we hadnt begun our school day yet so most of the children dont know what happened
7642450 actually a couple of calls came in first some parents who saw an adult male in the back of the school that was armed with a gun a knife and baseball bat
7642451 he was waving around the bat swinging the bat as the deputy approached
7642452 the deputy saw his gun ordered the man to drop the bat at the same time our officers arrived
7642453 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible im so happy im just saying super healthy ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach

7642468 studies have found that trasylol can increase the risk of kidney damage compared with other drugs
7642469 that study was halted because trasylol appeared to increase the risk for death compared with two other drugs

7642471 we think our service can be a step above what consumers enjoy today in the industry
7642472 we also know the dry cleaning industry is very large and its here to stay and we believe we can offer something for unmet needs
7642473 theyve got too much stuff on their plate and i dont think theyre going to get that involved in dry cleaning
7642474 you should exercise caution if travelling along the m27 road particularly around gori and kutaisi
7642475 there is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas in which fighting took place or in military installations where russian troops were present
7642476 you should avoid these areas until they are reported as having been cleared
7642477 on august 24 an unexplained explosion near the railway line at skra 10km west of gori destroyed a fuel train you should avoid this rail route for the time being
7642478 there remains a risk of local volunteer militia or criminal activity in these areas and around akhelgori you should take all necessary steps to protect your safety
7642479 will whitmore is an old friend of ours and we are really excited to be hitting the road together again

7642482 over the past few years i have come to see the people at ruby falls as an extended family
7642483 it is nice to know that they support me going back to school like any real family i hope their faith in me is answered and i make them proud
7642484 as a ruby falls tour guide i meet new friends play a big game of follow the leader and learn that employees can be my family i would like to thank god the scholarship committee and mo steiner for the award
7642485 this is an unusual case of literally purse snatching someones tenncare card to obtain the means for getting an addictive painkiller

7642489 working during holidays is no longer strange and degrading the economic hardship cameroon is facing has sent many to the streets so in order to survive one has to do any job menial or not
7642490 i am not ashamed of what i am doing because it sustains me when i see my friends i signal them and they come over
7642491 i am compelled to work during the holidays unlike before because the little money my father gets from his job is no longer sufficient for the upkeep of the family this is because of the hike in the prices of basic commodities
7642492 the only jobs available for undergraduates are unskilled jobs we have no other option than to take what is handed to us
7642493 during the break i relax watching movies i am not in a precarious financial situation so i do not need to work i do my house chores everyday and that is about it
7642494 were absolutely 100 percent in a weather driven market right now
7642495 its getting to be a critical timeframe any rain past sept 10 wont help the corn anymore itll be too late at that point
7642496 the people putting on the opening ceremony decided to put their best face on the show
7642497 yes its a show or smoke and mirrors if you will it is put on as a display carefully orchestrated for public consumption in order to create a certain opinion generated by the viewer of said show
7642498 i have gone to the market several times to buy and if i happen to have fcfa 10 or fcfa 5 with other coins the traders refuse to take them on grounds that when they go to buy the other traders would not also take them and i have quite an amount in stock
7642499 some irresponsible people use gutters in the dark to dump rubbish thereby increasing the level of garbage in the municipality and making it difficult to manage the waste
7642500 even where they are provided they are an eyesore because the council takes time to empty them causing people to dump their waste matter in the gutters hoping that they would be washed away by rain water
7642501 my store is flooded with run offs because the gutters are blocked by dirt
7642502 i was able to arrange my goods and keep those that could be soaked away from the water i always go back to my store whenever it is raining to prevent a disaster
7642503 the perishable ones like cocoyam and plantain peelings should be thrown in a pit where they would rot and used as manure non perishable waste like plastic bags should be burnt
7642504 it is not our responsibility the ministry of public works and the ministry of urban affairs are in charge and have the funds for this buea is the only place where hysacam does not operate
7642505 the healing process is going to be a little longer than four days

7642552 we were wondering if larger animals also have this magnetic sense
7642553 sometimes it took hours and hours to find some pictures with good resolution
7642554 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7642555 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7642556 ive never noticed that my cows all face the same way
7642557 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible

7642607 the new king said to his people look the israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we come let us deal shrewdly with them or they will increase and in the event of war join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor they the israelites built supply cities pithom and rameses for pharaoh but the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread so that the egyptians came to dread the israelites the egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the israelites and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor they were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them

7642633 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7642634 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7642635 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7642636 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7642637 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7642638 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7642639 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7642640 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7642641 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7642642 if you read a lot of holocaust literature all survivor stories are miraculous
7642643 it literally takes place 20 minutes after casino royale ends
7642644 we pick the story up obviously with james bond out for revenge on a personal vendetta it then gets more complicated than that
7642645 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7642646 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7642647 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7642648 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7642649 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7642650 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7642651 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty
7642652 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7642653 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7642654 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home
7642655 not to separate themselves from the democratic party but because thats where their constituents are you dont find your constituents in denver and these are important days
7642656 im sure that there are some that are intentionally staying away just as a symbolic indicator of their independence
7642657 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going

7642660 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7642661 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7642662 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up

7642666 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
7642667 barack obama is a pro abortion radical so theres nothing surprising about his choosing a pro abortion running mate
7642668 neither senator obama nor senator biden seems to have taken catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously
7642669 the churchs pro life position is not sectarian it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument
7642670 neither obama nor biden seems willing to do that which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness
7642671 catholics for obama tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro abortion ticket in american history
7642672 an affable veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of sen john kerry by overselling his catholic credentials
7642673 a wake up call to the church clergy and laity alike
7642674 improve the way we hand on the faith be willing to exercise the spiritual work of mercy of admonishing the sinner and to keep politically active so that such people are voted out of office
7642675 if a politician cannot respect the life of a little baby how is he supposed to respect yours and mine
7642676 the democrats are slapping faithful catholics right in the face first they will nominate the most pro abortion candidate in history then they refuse to invite the beloved archbishop of denver even to offer a prayer at their convention and now they nominate a pro abortion catholic as vice president only self hating catholics could vote for this ticket
7642677 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7642678 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington del has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
7642679 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy

7642694 we cant take 4 more years of bush mccain policies
7642695 one problem i do have with the ad is that it feels like it is out there in isolation perhaps i just havent been paying close enough attention but obama hasnt really been calling mccain a third bush term in a couple of months

7642729 theres no strategic decisions in this district about how to bring everything together
7642730 were causing our own problems by not thinking about things in a systemic way
7642731 for the young people who attend those schools its great
7642732 but could we have a situation where we didnt have to rob peter to pay paul
7642733 criteria to keep some kids out you leave the large comprehensive high schools with a serious lack of resources
7642734 innovation for the sake of innovation is not something im interested in

7642736 new superintendents have the prerogative to bring whatever changes and best practices to the district they serve i did that im sure shes going to bring her own ideas to try to take the district to the next level and i wish her the very best

7642746 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
7642747 the program mixed chinas ancient history and culture with elements showcasing the modern face of the country
7642748 in place of the cult of personality that the communist party built around chairman mao the chinese are embracing a new cult celebrity
7642749 homebody quiet and a good listener granddad grandpa old man does not refer to himself as
7642750 he basically just said i was asking to be raped
7642751 he was saying that the posture of her rear end could be appealing to a sexual predator
7642752 he took a pretty innocent picture and made it look sleazy
7642753 my whole life ive really prided myself on being a christian girl and having this pure image
7642754 he just completely ruined that reputation that i worked for
7642755 interacted online with unknown people and also engaged in a high number of different risky online behaviors

7642757 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7642758 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7642759 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7642760 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7642761 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7642762 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7642763 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7642764 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7642765 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7642766 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7642767 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7642768 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7642772 i will be coach while the club wants me and while i want to be here as soon as one of us doesnt think im the right man for the job it is time to move on
7642773 leigh puts a lot of work into his team and what theyre going to do and i think that thats shown over a period of this year anyway theyve got themselves into incredible positions and he hasnt wanted to change the way theyre playing
7642774 the win loss ratio is the only thing a coach can be judged on
7642775 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7642776 since i was about 18 or 19 theyve been my favorite band

7642781 this sunday will be an emotional and important game for essendon as we farewell four players who in their own way have each had a big impact on the club and its supporters
7642782 i just found myself in the position that i didnt want to hold the club back
7642783 im really happy with my decision and the support the club has given me especially over my journey theyve been nothing short of amazing
7642784 rama is a courageous person and is incredibly well thought of by the playing group coaches and staff i hope he continues to be involved with the club in the future
7642785 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos

7642788 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7642789 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
7642790 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
7642791 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7642792 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7642793 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7642794 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7642795 international treaties and agreement cannot be changed overnight if there is any requirement that will be discussed at the appropriate time
7642796 we believe that the sri lankan side is willing to accept that there are certain traditional fishing rights that should be observed
7642797 one of the major reasons the protests snowballed to the levels weve seen
7642798 is that we allowed hard line islamists to run of the city allowing them to use mosques to broadcast appeals for people to come out on the streets our withdrawal also allowed them to pressure people otherwise unsympathetic to the secessionist cause to join the protests
7642799 work with all of us for the rapid social and economic development of assam
7642800 the northeast has immense development potential and we will make every effort to ensure that it is realised however the continued activities of insurgent groups create a climate of fear and insecurity not conducive to rapid economic development and new investment in assam and other northeastern states
7642801 our government has been reviewing the implementation of the assam accord and is committed to ensuring its implementation in letter and in spirit
7642802 our regulatory framework for medical education needs to pro actively promote the spread of medical education to all parts of our country there is a need to amend the charter of the medical council of india to incorporate this as a major objective
7642803 if any harmful ingredients are detected during the tests the district collectors concerned can seize the vehicle and destroy the contents
7642804 a stronger dollar spurred declines for metals and oil prices everythings about the dollar trade right now the bucks bounce has completely crushed commodities
7642805 fears of more weakness in the u s economy send the dollar sinking
7642806 commodities dive as concerns grow about the impact of a global economic slowdown on commodity demand crude oil falls on signs that a u s economic slump will extend into 2009
7642807 whereas the underlying driver of stock prices is a rising sense of optimism commodities are driven by fear this suggests energy trading has reached an important mania era endpoint
7642808 this is in fact what happens when a bubble is about to burst
7642809 the stage is set for a long term reversal that permeates the commodity markets
7642810 it is a critical stage with the project nearing completion at this juncture any disruption will be a disaster for west bengal
7642811 therefore i have sent a letter to ms banerjee with the hope that we can arrive at a consensus we cannot miss the project

7642813 if he bowls a bad ball you need to punish him
7642814 only then will pressure build on him until now he wasnt under pressure so he has bowling at his best
7642815 the way we are batting its tough to sacrifice the extra batsman for the luxury of a fifth specialist bowler
7642816 guys do tend to have hiccups for one or two games but these are quality players who are eager to get back into form its a question of playing out the early overs which we have not managed

7642847 this isnt technical research pulled together by ed stetzer and the people at lifeway these are conclusions i have come to after living in this community for 31 years sharing the gospel here for 14 years and serving as pastor here for seven years
7642848 hes patient not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance
7642849 most of our brother christians showed unbounded love and loyalty never sparing themselves and thinking only of one another heedless of danger they took charge of the sick attending to their every need and ministering to them in christ and with them departed this life serenely happy for they were infected by others with the disease drawing on themselves the sickness of caring for others transferred their death to themselves and died in their stead the best of our brothers lost their lives in this manner a number of presbyters deacons and laymen winning high commendation so that death in this form the result of great piety and strong faith seems in every way the equal of matyrdom
7642850 these impious because the rejected roman gods galileans not only feed their own poor but ours also welcoming them into their agapae they attract them as children are attracted with cakes whilst the pagan priests neglect the poor the hated galileans devote themselves to works of charity and by a displa of false compassion have established and given effect to their pernicious errors see their love feasts and their tables spread for the indigent such practice is common among them and causes a contempt for our gods
7642851 i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor
7642852 this isnt technical research pulled together by ed stetzer and the people at lifeway these are conclusions i have come to after living in this community for 31 years sharing the gospel here for 14 years and serving as pastor here for seven years
7642853 this is a clear demonstration of what little consideration these people give to rural communities and their families

7642862 because of the economic downturn we have students with issues above tuition were going to have issues with students not able to eat or get back and forth to class if they live off campus and rents due a number of cases like that
7642863 this is the first day we feel that its going to start coming in how fast or how many we dont know we want to be prepared to help those students we dont want them to drop out number one goal is retention and student success
7642864 we want to do everything possible to make sure they stay in school
7642865 its never too late to ask for help i tell students all the time if you dont ask you never know if you dont try you fail the thing is to ask somebody
7642866 i have that safety net that the school is providing that is great
7642867 this is what ive wanted since i was 5 to come here experience this life becoming something of myself

7642878 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7642879 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7642880 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7642881 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7642882 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7642883 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7642884 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7642885 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7642886 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7642887 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7642888 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7642889 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7642890 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7642891 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7642892 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7642893 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7642894 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7642895 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7642896 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7642897 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7642898 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7642899 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7642900 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7642901 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7642902 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7642903 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7642904 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7642905 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7642906 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7642907 tomorrow when i am back at the club i will discuss these things it is important to be focused before a game last week we only talked about wigan but tomorrow i will talk about players tomorrow when i come into the club i will discuss this or that who comes who goes first we finished the game now we get back to london and i start a new week
7642908 if deco is scoring goals or if lampard is scoring goals is not important what is important is if chelsea win chelsea is more important than us they are friends and if one scores the other players are happy i read that lampard in the last two or three seasons has scored 20 goals every year this season maybe 25 but maybe 15 or 10 maybe even five it is not important as long as chelsea win
7642909 when you play the top teams you have to have people ready and willing to do their jobs and run a million miles my midfield four ran themselves to a standstill you have to do that you have to physically work harder then they do but we just lacked that little bit of quality the set piece delivery just wasnt there it was terrible and that is the one disappointment in pre season olivier kapo jason koumas and daniel de ridder have all delivered and our set pieces are usually good but here they were appalling and it didnt matter who took them because they all had a go you need good dead ball specialists and we have some good ones but they were a huge disappointment
7642910 who is that lad by the way where has he been playing for the last couple of years seriously though he oozes class and that is why he is at the very highest level chelsea had a bad day but there was one bit of brilliance from deco

7642914 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7642915 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7642916 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household
7642917 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7642918 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7642919 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7642920 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7642921 some of these bloggers are talking about patients in a way that physicians usually only talk behind closed doors

7642926 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7642927 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect

7642965 weve been talking to comcast but theres nothing to report at this time
7642966 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7642967 its such a tragedy and theres something seriously wrong with how our society functions i hope that this event causes us to think about what needs to be done so that we can take better care of each other and prevent this from happening again in the future
7642968 whoa another shooting i wasnt very surprised cause shootings are so common but i feel bad for the families but things like this happen with people who isolate themselves we need to communicate with them more encourage them more and let them know that there are people out there who care
7642969 i feel a bit of sorrow im very disappointed that stuff like this keeps happening i was saddened by the sense that theres a waste of life
7642970 i was shocked i think its unfortunate something we never expect and were never prepared for
7642971 my initial thought is all this violence is a direct product of our society meaning you know how people talk about these individuals as outcasts theyre outcasts because someone outcasted them especially in a time when people say religion and the gospel is so irrelevant heres a case where its relevant if theres any room to express godly love to one another if theres any need for forgiveness and supporting one another which is pretty much in the name of christ the gospel if theres any need for that it would be now
7642972 i think at a time like this and a tragedy like this its very difficult to choose those words i would communicate the grace of god in these circumstances id offer comfort and support that they need at this time
7642973 i wouldnt say anything and i would just listen i think they need someone to talk to
7642974 id say i dont understand how youre feeling at this time but ill be praying for you and thinking of all the families i hope the media lets you grieve in peace
7642975 im sorry for what happened to your family but through this we can learn from it and maybe prevent it from happening again prevent by getting out of our own clique and reaching out to other people as well by not doing what other people did

7642979 what the advocates state is that what we dont like is enforcement of the law itself

7642993 the hsus photographer had at least one opportunity to help relieve the suffering of an animal by assisting another employee
7642994 although the credibility and conduct of hsus is questionable in this case the incident does offer the opportunity for the livestock industry to re examine its supply chain

7643094 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
7643095 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
7643096 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
7643097 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
7643098 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan
7643099 we do need to move forward and so we are moving forward with our plans in the town of cape vincent i think it would be tough for them lyme officials to come up with something that we could work with within the time line of our current project but for some future project its certainly possible
7643100 i think we need to be fair we need to do whats best for everyone in the town so im hoping that we can find a fair and happy medium
7643101 lowering the drinking age will be a win win situation for colleges they will make more money by selling booze on campus as well as have immunity from lawsuits and prosecution from tragedies involving underage drinkers on their campuses
7643102 lowering the legal drinking age would make the lives of students who choose to drink alcohol much safer by bringing it into a supervised social setting
7643103 they can not responsibly drink at a lower age now what makes the colleges think they can drink responsibly if the law were changed
7643104 since people can vote drive fly planes get married and fight in wars they should be able to drink also at 18
7643105 i worked in the counseling field for 17 years the college presidents have not seen the families destroyed by underage drinking they havent seen the kids ruined for life from a death of a friend from underage drinking and driving
7643106 it is hard to see the mine close yet one more time this will hurt our little community greatly as it has done in the past i feel for all the families that are affected by this sudden closure and wish them all well

7643125 subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7643126 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7643127 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7643128 my heart goes out to all those families affected by this terrible outbreak of listeriosis
7643129 im sure that all officials involved are working their hardest to ensure the health and safety of canadians but this incident highlights the dangers of the conservative decision to abandon key food inspections and cut funding to critical food safety programming
7643130 this government has approved plans to walk away from critical food inspections cfia has admitted that it has cut funding to avian influenza preparedness
7643131 the current recall of food shows how important it is to have the cfia on the job now is the time to invest more in food safety not less we dont need a government that is trying to cover that up
7643132 we have seen the results of these types of cuts with the mike harris conservative government in ontario they led directly to walkerton and the increase in food safety risks in the aylmer meat plant incident
7643133 the same conservatives like john baird tony clement and jim flaherty who sat at the cabinet table in ontario then are key members of prime minister stephen harpers cabinet in ottawa now
7643134 decision to cut costs by privatizing laboratory testing of water samples in 1996

7643137 we must scale the size of our organization to mirror the amount of business we are doing today in order to remain efficient profitable and competitive
7643138 the marketplace will not allow us the luxury of having the same size staff that we did as a larger company
7643139 with great sorrow and disappointment that employees who have served the company well are losing their jobs through no fault of their own our loss will be a gain for anyone looking for quality employees
7643140 the remaining employees at hooker have a more secure future
7643141 although we are profitable and financially solid we arent as profitable as we have been and should be and part of the reason is the significant amount of overhead we have been carrying part of being competitive is to be sure we are an efficient organization and that our infrastructure is in line with sales volume
7643142 while committed to reducing costs weve said all along that we will be careful not to do anything that would compromise either product quality or customer service

7643148 hey you how are ya these days you still steady keepin on
7643149 oh my yes i been around for enough verses to know that chorus by heart i hear ya over there what are you drinking
7643150 so tell me whats goin on kiddo and dont spare me any details
7643151 watch it so why dont you drop some of it
7643152 dont want anyone else weighed down with my foolishness and mayhem
7643153 but we love you we take it on because we love you its not weighing us down its compensating for times when you are maybe not strong enough to carry it alone its nothing that you dont do for everyone in your life and yet never seem ok with demanding in return
7643154 i feel like i am going through too much to be able to in good conscience give it over to anyone and i am afraid that if i do i will just leave it and never pick it up again never deal with it
7643155 but we are not taught to not give things over and the way youre dealing with it now is killing you
7643156 think back over the 2 years kiddo its been a roller coaster youve loved youve lost youre in love again youre trapped in texas your mom has been ailing youre estranged from your father and your entire family your friends are on an entirely different coast you lost more than a few family members you been through more trials and tribulations on the job than anyone should ever have to deal with you been sick and stressed run down and tired all the time tryin to handle all this on your own this would be a lot for anyone to bear but its especially hard when youre young when youre still growing and when youre trying to do it alone
7643157 la listen you know what you have to do you know those people you need to get out of your life you know the moves you need and want to make you are more well versed in your issues than any other mere human i know you know that
7643158 from what i gather you have the makings of a good support system in place you just have to stop being prideful and use it
7643159 the problem with what you know is the things you havent dealt with its those things that keep sneaking up on you when youre still it has nothing to do with any of those immediate concerns you just spent a half hour venting about those things are not the things that are keeping you from doing the things you know you need to do the changes you wanna make will all fall into place because they are meant for you but you gotta give everything room to fall into place you gotta clear some stuff outta the way
7643160 there is no i dont know either you ready or you not there is no shame in not being ready but you must recognize that if you are not that means staying in the same place you are now
7643161 you have someone you can lean on while you transition
7643162 you are already everything you need you are strong enough to do it alone its harder but you can and if you dont have to then you shouldnt
7643163 so do it you know i dont believe in baby steps just do it dive in as deep as you can and work hard to get back to the surface
7643164 stop crying everthing is already taken care of your path been set for you kiddo you just have to have enough faith to walk it
7643165 i know the largest thing you deal with and it is a hard beast to struggle with but you were created far stronger than any adversary now all you have to do is believe it
7643166 oh no mrs b got off that kick now she only lets us drink water cant even have juice in the house she says it has too much sugar or some nonsense you know shes always on some new age kick back in my day we ate what we grew and it was fine

7643280 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7643281 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7643282 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7643283 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7643284 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7643285 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7643286 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7643287 who are open to doing something on the production side
7643288 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7643289 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7643290 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7643291 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7643292 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7643293 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7643294 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7643295 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7643296 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7643297 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7643315 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7643316 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7643317 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7643318 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7643319 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7643320 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7643321 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7643322 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7643323 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7643324 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7643325 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7643326 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7643327 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7643328 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7643329 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7643330 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7643331 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7643332 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7643333 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7643334 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7643335 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7643336 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7643337 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7643338 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7643339 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7643340 nato ei kaitse meid automaatselt kui meil endal puudub ettevalmistus ja kaitsetahe

7643374 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7643375 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7643376 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7643377 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7643378 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7643379 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7643380 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7643381 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7643382 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7643383 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7643384 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7643385 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7643386 tear down the temple and rebuild it in 3 days
7643387 he will confirm a covenant with many for one seven in the middle of the seven he will put an end to sacrifice and offering and on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation until the end that is decreed is poured out on him
7643388 his armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation 32 with flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant but the people who know their god will firmly resist him
7643389 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7643390 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7643391 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7643392 they went apparently with the intent to conduct a cordon and search because of allegations there may have been weapons in the camp
7643393 the government has been waiting for an opportunity to close the camp down
7643394 if people start to have the feeling that the war has been taken to the camps then youre talking about a tinderbox
7643395 the government wants to evacuate the camp by any means peacefully or by force
7643396 kalma is seen as a stronghold and thats why the government targeted this camp
7643397 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7643398 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7643399 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7643400 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7643401 ja bijna de hele weg al en dat laatste gedeelte hobbelde nogal dus je begrijpt ik verlang zo naar je
7643402 doe het met je mond schat maar snel want ik sta op springen
7643403 nee jij blijft hier lekker liggen en geniet van mn showtje
7643404 dat vertel ik je later wel ik heb een plannetje voor vanavond
7643405 ik maak er een echte hete serie van zei rob
7643406 jammer dat er geen derde bij is dacht ik want dan hadden we fotos van ons samen kunnen laten maken
7643407 om 6 uur sluiten we maar als je even voor 6 er bent dan liggen ze klaar
7643408 ik ga vast aan het eten beginnen en dan willen jullie misschien wel even de fotos even ophalen
7643409 dit mag ik anja niet onthouden dus ik sloop muisstil terug en even later stonden we samen verdekt opgesteld naar de masturberende puber te loeren hij zal niet ouder zijn dan 16 fluisterde anja wat een lekker ding h persoonlijk heb iets meer met oudere knullen maar ik weet dat anja helemaal op dat jonge spul geilt na enkele minuten kwam hij zo te zien heerlijk klaar en spoot zn sperma al kreunend over de fotos hij bleef na het eerste shot trekken en perste de laatste druppels er uit en liet ze zorgvuldig boven op de fotos vallen wij konden het niet al te goed zien en dachten dat het zon geil afruktijdschriftje was maar later bleek dat niet zo te zijn ik riep zachtjes naar hem
7643410 ik kan toch moeilijk maandag terug komen bij je moeder om nieuwe afdrukken te vragen
7643411 ik wed dat ie zich wel 8 keer per dag afrukt op deze leeftijd zijn die gastjes zo walgelijk potent
7643412 hij heeft zon lekker kontje misschien kan ik hem wel verleiden
7643413 ik heb er een paar vergrotingen gratis bij gedaan om het goed te maken
7643414 les 1 vrij altijd veilig als je elkaar niet goed kent
7643415 even rustig aan schat les twee is het voorspel ik krijg nu zon medelijden met hem wanthij wil zo graag en hij toch moet nog zo veel leren eigenlijk staat ook wel een beetje voor paal met mij als toeschouwer er bij dat kan niet leuk voor hem zijn dus trek ik me stilletjes terug in de gang
7643416 de les over het naspel slaan we maar even over
7643417 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7643418 is there a gulf war illness mycoplasma vaccines depleted uranium etc
7643419 parallel stories which are not on point to protect the real story that you are not hearing due to the total suppression of the truth by the enemys
7643420 i will let peter tell you google video joyce riley exposd
7643421 not to be confused with the people who alex jones is there baby bottle amp they get everything from him
7643422 i predicted 9 11 im the father of the 9 11 truth movement
7643423 well i know this is true and he is the only guy who stands up publicly who said this so he cant be a bad person and i will think positively about him and not consider the negative people and what they warn about him
7643424 theyre hamm by el diablo hand signs exposed thursday jan
7643425 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7643426 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7643427 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7643428 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7643429 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7643430 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7643431 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7643432 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7643433 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7643434 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7643435 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7643436 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7643437 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7643438 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7643439 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

7643484 nos ltimos anos crescemos a uma m dia de 5 a 6 por cento

7643486 ainda n o h muitos investimentos nisso o governo est fazendo muito barulho sobre o pac mas h mais coisa no papel do que fora dele no entanto devem aparecer nos pr ximos dois a tr s anos isso gera um bom potencial para a nossa ind stria

7643494 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
7643495 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
7643496 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
7643497 alright dublin its pretty cold so lets just get started yeah
7643498 the more you dance the more the sun come out
7643499 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7643500 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7643501 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7643502 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7643503 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7643504 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7643505 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7643506 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us

7643515 well on some mondays i go at 7ish then if i have time after work during the rest of the week i try to fit it in
7643516 this is a significant finding because it means we can screen for people who carry mutations to see if they are at risk for neuroblastoma
7643517 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7643518 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7643519 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7643520 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7643521 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7643522 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7643523 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7643524 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7643525 there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
7643526 die hintergr nde dieses verhaltens sind noch v llig unbekannt
7643527 daraufhin ist die idee entstanden auch gr ere s ugetiere auf einen sinn f r magnetismus zu untersuchen

7643531 i am committed to using the power of my office to step in when the federal government has failed to take action on critical issues affecting new york
7643532 the epas repeated failure to control global warming pollution will not go unchallenged by new york state
7643533 taylors reference to his role on the court as one of the boys is an insult to women which is no surprise given his record of indifference to workplace rape and abuse
7643534 at a time when women have made so many strides toward being treated as equals especially in the workplace it is disturbing to see this attitude at the highest levels of government
7643535 any attempt by taylor to keep this issue away from the voters will be a blatant political move intended only to protect his personal pay and special perks
7643536 the democratic party wants to go back to the days of frivolous lawsuits
7643537 they want to go back to the days where trial lawyers would shop around for judges who would deconstruct the law or the constitution should that be required in a particular cause
7643538 trial lawyers inc has been hoping to replace this well schooled and principled jurist with liberal activist justices holding three of the seven seats on the court replacing justice taylor with one of their own would facilitate a judicial assault on legislatively enacted tort reforms
7643539 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7643540 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7643541 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7643542 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7643543 independent associations between low density lipoprotein cholesterol and cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
7643544 with chronic diseases such as diabetes and other forms of autoimmunity most therapies have traditionally used nonspecific immunosuppression because it was thought that the rare autoreactive t cells could not be identified much less selectively killed
7643545 a defective nf signaling pathway which leads to cell death now provides at least in vitro a unique opportunity in human autoimmune diseases to kill only autoreactive t cells
7643546 an expanding body of research in animal models suggests the opposite strategy may be warranted
7643547 this study shows that autoreactive t cells although rare can be selectively destroyed in isolated human blood
7643548 tnf and tnf receptor 2 agonist may offer highly targeted therapies with the latter likely to be less systemically toxic
7643549 selective death of autoreactive t cells in human autoimmunity by tnf or tnf receptor 2 agonism

7643559 the idea that people should cater to the amazing smallness of this dude strains good sense his anger is clearly more important to him than the fate of his country this is what must have driven andrew and hitch insane bill clinton carries this sense of having been perpetually wronged the game is only fair when he wins i think what must burn him up the most is assuming that its true that the obama people pushed the race baiting angle that obama actually sista souljahed clinton that he took a few minor mis statements used them to paint bill as well exactly what he was

7643562 we believe this is a major breakthrough as hussain is possibly the one who planned the jaipur terror strike he was arrested in lucknow on sunday night and will be brought to jaipur either monday night or tuesday morning
7643563 we managed to get information about hussain from sajid mansuri in ahmedabad mansuri and hussain could be the main links to the jaipur blasts case
7643564 as per our information shahbaz can disclose names of the persons who purchased bicycles that were used in the blasts

7643566 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments isnt uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it were surprised to learn that we found a new virus
7643567 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
7643568 cst mws users already benefiting from our acceleration solutions will experience significant performance improvements with a simple software update
7643569 this combined offering enables acceleware and cst to deliver the first ever cuda powered solution to solve electromagnetic problems
7643570 nvidia tesla products in combination with cst and accelewares software provide an accelerated design environment for end users to reduce the time spent simulating products
7643571 accelewares use of cuda in its libraries to harness the parallel architecture of the gpu will provide compelling value and considerable speed ups for designers who frequently perform em simulations
7643572 accelewares hardware acceleration solutions have been well received by our customers achieving an accurate solution in a shorter time frame is instrumental in bringing their products to market earlier
7643573 we are really excited by the prospect of offering them an even faster cuda enhanced solution as part of their regular maintenance

7643578 put obama into the white house even though hes not qualified to be president and we can have a post racial era america can never be called racist again you yes you personally can never be called racist again but if he doesnt win well it just confirms that america is still a racist country like in the sixties and that you personally if you didnt vote for him are a racist

7643601 although web 2 0 is entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
7643602 later in between two and five years cloud computing and service oriented architecture will deliver transformation by driving deep changes in the role and capabilities of it
7643603 many types of technology providers are aligning themselves with this trend with the result that confusion and hype will continue for at least another year before distinct submarkets and market leaders emerge
7643604 other technologies that have begun to be interesting to business include 3d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots
7643605 we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of applications
7643606 no i could not meet them for lunch because my son takes his morning nap from 11 1 now
7643607 it is no longer winter i do not need to dress warm i do not need a hat i need a light jacket will you dress me so warm when the summer is here as well i am about to melt down
7643608 maybe its not a great decision to hit somebody and fight for two more yards maybe i should just get down
7643609 was i able to still play and compete you tell me one guy who was 100 percent at the end of the season
7643610 running single wing plays like we do at times here at florida to be able to have a quarterback like that thats a threat
7643611 this is the best weve felt at running back this is our fourth season and its not very comparable as far as work ethic attitude and work level at tailback
7643612 sometimes you look back and say i ran the ball 27 times against mississippi thats a lot
7643613 its the situation its the moment youre never thinking it its what can i do to win
7643614 sometimes you make it and you get lucky and you wont get hit the wrong way sometimes you might be tweaked or hit the wrong way thats something you might have to work around
7643615 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7643616 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7643617 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7643618 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7643619 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7643620 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7643621 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7643622 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7643623 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7643624 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7643625 while the aclu the free market foundation and the texas eagle forum disagree on many issues we are delighted that our united opinion on this unconstitutional law prevailed
7643626 this victory secures the rights of every citizen in texas to be free to speak their mind about the speaker of the house race without the fear of being thrown into jail
7643627 security specialists and administrators have been working since they discovered the attack to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall fedora systems
7643628 we are using the requisite outages as an opportunity to do other upgrades for the sake of functionality as well as security
7643629 while there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories we have decided to convert to a new fedora signing key
7643630 assuming that this was done correctly there was no risk of their key being compromised
7643631 someone was able to get a token but was not actually able to get the key
7643632 limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms
7643633 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease

7643641 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7643642 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7643643 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7643644 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7643645 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7643646 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7643647 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7643648 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
7643649 its been over four months since the country is being led by a resigning government which lacks legitimacy to address the problems
7643650 we launched a series of protests in april because the price of rice and other food products were too high but prices have doubled since then
7643651 and president rene preval and politicians in parliament are not doing anything to address the problems

7643655 this provided an exceptional and unique opportunity to examine risk and resilience processes in such a heavily burdened population
7643656 these findings highlight the potential importance of community mental health efforts as protective resources in times of traumatic stress more research on the subject is necessary to determine the extent to which support helps students cope with the difficulties
7643657 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7643658 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7643659 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7643660 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7643661 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7643662 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7643663 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7643669 the congresswoman is just excited about the convention and all republicans coming here
7643670 i think that will reinforce the image that a lot of people have of her policy perspectives that this has really been about supporting the failed policies of the bush administration in lockstep right down the line

7643673 well get calls from adult children cleaning out their parents closets or letters from guilt stricken seniors who want to return items to the hotel
7643674 we want people to know that its ok we forgive you wed just like to have these items back so we can document the peabodys history through its artifacts and share her story with future generations
7643675 i have sometimes been ready to think that the passion for liberty cannot be equally strong in the breasts of those who have been accustomed to deprive their fellow creatures of theirs
7643676 there will be a complete shutdown on tuesday and people have been asked to observe a black out against the highhandedness of indian forces and arrest of our leaders
7643677 earlier system was more stringent but now even if a student does not have any offer in hand he can stay in canada for three more years and look for jobs
7643678 the three year work experience will help the person to get canadian citizenship
7643679 small countries raising objections at the meet could not have been without the knowledge of the us
7643680 small countries raised objections to the indo us n deal and it was not without the knowledge of the us
7643681 most of the objections were raised on the clauses of hyde act like continuous fuel supply to india as a result india wont get a clean and unconditional waiver which the government has been claiming so far
7643682 the upa government that the us will use its clout to get a clean waiver but this has not happened at vienna
7643683 a french delegation is set to arrive here on august 27 for a three day negotiation round following which the social security agreement will be finalised
7643684 our principle focus right now has been on the india civil nuclear deal having worked through the iaea now working through the nsg and still trying to get into a position to make the appropriate presidential determinations in early september so thats our focus right now on the civil nuclear side
7643685 were going to continue to review what we will do about the various elements of the relationship with russia as you know weve been very focused on what to do for georgia weve been making certain that theres a clear message that there arent going to be any new lines in europe
7643686 the matter is important we are ready to hear it
7643687 we are extending the stay on the tribunals order by another six weeks
7643688 we have to attract investments incidents and such events obviously shed the confidence of the investor especially in the particular state in which it is
7643689 so i would really urge all political parties if they have their concerns to sit and resolve them
7643690 we have imposed curfew in kathua town after fresh violence broke out in the town and a mob ransacked some shops and pco booths of a particular community and later clashed with police

7643700 while the political set up of the country is engaged in finding a solution to the amarnath row people like mehbooba mufti are airing views in support of the separatists what right does she have to say that any compromise on the issue is unacceptable
7643701 the rightful place for people like her is not the political arena but they should be behind bars on charges of anti national activity

7643733 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7643734 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7643735 obviously the ultimate goal is to avoid labs having to use animals altogether eventually
7643736 the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7643737 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments isnt uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it were surprised to learn that we found a new virus

7643746 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7643747 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now

7643785 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7643786 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7643787 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

7643806 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7643807 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7643808 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily

7643814 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7643815 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7643816 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7643817 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7643818 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

7643834 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7643835 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7643836 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7643837 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7643838 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to

7643883 on the part of the north the war was carried on not to liberate slaves but by a government that had always perverted and violated the constitution to keep the slaves in bondage and was still willing to do so if the slaveholders could be thereby induced to stay in the union

7643890 a political audit of the last 60 years would prove that the assumption that a separate status for jammu and kashmir would lead to its full integration with the indian union has been belied

7643918 der eine punkt in k ln und das los gegen hansa rostock ist f r uns ein befreiungsschlag
7643919 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7643920 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7643921 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7643922 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7643923 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7643924 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7643925 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7643926 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7643927 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7643928 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7643929 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7643930 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7643931 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7643932 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7643933 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7643934 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

7643937 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7643938 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7643939 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7643940 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7643941 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7643942 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7643943 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7643944 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7643945 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7643946 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7643947 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7643948 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7643949 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7643950 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7643951 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7643952 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7643953 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7643954 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7643955 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7643956 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7643957 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7643958 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7643959 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7643960 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7643961 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7643962 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7643963 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7643964 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7643965 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7643966 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7643967 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7643968 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7643969 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7643970 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7643971 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7643972 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7643973 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7643974 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7643975 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7643976 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7643977 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7643978 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7643979 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7643980 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7643981 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7643982 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7643983 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7643984 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7643985 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7643986 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7643987 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7643988 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7643989 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7643990 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7643991 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7643992 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7643993 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7643994 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7643995 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7643996 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7643997 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7643998 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7643999 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7644000 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7644001 tidak akan ada banyak cerita sampai malam sang kandidat menyampaikan pidato menerima penunjukan
7644002 dukungan hillary kepada obama sangat jelas hillary dan obama memiliki kesamaan komitmen untuk mengubah arah negara mccain tidak akan melakukan perubahan
7644003 kami ingin meyakinkan bahwa warga as tahu persis siapa obama kedua agar warga tahu bahwa obama adalah kandidat yang akan melakukan perubahan di washington dan juga agar diketahui bahwa mccain tidak lebih dari perpanjangan kebijakan presiden as george w bush
7644004 obama jelas belum mendapatkan posisi yang melejit terhadap mccain seharusnya tahun ini adalah tahun yang mudah bagi demokrat karena itu saya kira warga as memang masih harus diyakinkan soal program program obama dan diyakinkan bahwa obama adalah sebuah harapan yang kuat
7644005 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7644006 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7644007 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7644008 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7644009 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7644010 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7644011 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7644012 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7644013 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7644014 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7644015 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7644016 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7644017 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7644018 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7644019 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7644020 all i can do is be me whoever that is
7644021 with these particular funds the administrative fees have held constant for about 13 years
7644022 we thought the economies of scale probably would have been achieved and we hoped that the fee increases wouldnt need to be reached
7644023 the board looked over fees trying to position them competitively in their groups
7644024 they were already fairly competitive on the institutional side its a matter of being competitive in the fund grouping that they are looking at
7644025 we have been criticizing them for having some fairly expensive retail share classes
7644026 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7644027 andrew is one of the bright young coaches in the game today
7644028 and i am excited to have him leading our program he has shown the ability to win big games and recruit the top student athletes in the nation and i am confident that with andrew our program is in good hands i would also like to thank the search committee for the fantastic job they did in conducting this national search of highly qualified candidates
7644029 i am extremely excited and honored to be given the opportunity to be the head coach of the lacrosse program at fairfield
7644030 there is a strong tradition of winning at fairfield and i look forward to the challenge of taking the stags to the next level
7644031 i think that fairfield hired an outstanding coach and more importantly a great person
7644032 andy is very prepared for this job we are going to miss andy but wish him nothing but the best at fairfield
7644033 vi arbejder h rdt jeg vil gerne have at cden skal udkomme til december men det er ikke let taget i betragtning at berlusconi har et andet job at passe nemlig jobbet som italiens premierminister
7644034 dar ber bin ich froh wie fit ich wirklich bin wird sich allerdings erst zeigen aber ich habe wieder spa am tennis und bin zuversichtlich
7644035 sie ist auf dem richtigen weg und wieder hei aufs spielen
7644036 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7644037 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7644038 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7644039 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7644040 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7644041 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7644042 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7644043 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7644044 oh baby it is all about the crab cones and the lychee mojitos lovely helpful staff and what a fabulous seafood menu
7644045 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7644046 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7644047 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7644048 have known ron for a long time probably 7 years
7644049 i totally agree that the carnitas super burrito is great
7644050 with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
7644051 what do you stand for what are you going to do for us
7644052 what do you stand for what are you going to do for us
7644053 bay watch formerly first watch is one of my favorite breakfast places
7644054 im really hungry and i wanted to check out the food since i live in the neighborhood
7644055 i might be biased because this is where i stayed for my bachelorette party but this is a great hotel
7644056 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7644057 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7644058 seeking to bolster his nationalist credentials ahead of provincial elections
7644059 the prime ministers strong statements in support of an end to immunity and for a firm withdrawal timetable would make it difficult for him to accept an agreement that falls short of his public demands
7644060 wait theres one more thing you need to agree to
7644061 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
7644062 cuando alg n jurista me dice evo te est s equivocando jur dicamente eso que est s haciendo es ilegal bueno yo le meto por m s que sea ilegal despu s les digo a los abogados si es ilegal legalicen ustedes para qu han estudiado
7644063 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7644064 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7644065 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household
7644066 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7644067 move forward end the paralysis of city government and the public tragedy this personal tragedy has engendered
7644068 it was and is my advice that council not proceed with litigation against the mayor because michigan law supports the mayors position in the face of a deficit
7644069 it is perfectly clear under state law and supreme court precedent that i have a legal obligation to take steps to reduce our expenditures
7644070 rather than attacking the administration the council should join me in attacking the deficit and working cooperatively to get our budget under control
7644071 in these tough economic times we have to learn to live within our means just like the citizens we represent
7644072 the desire overwhelmingly is that we have all four golf courses open
7644073 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
7644074 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
7644075 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
7644076 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
7644077 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
7644078 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
7644079 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
7644080 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
7644081 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
7644082 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
7644083 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
7644084 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
7644085 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
7644086 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
7644087 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7644088 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7644089 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7644090 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7644091 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7644092 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7644093 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7644094 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
7644095 now you have to be punished because you excel at something

7644099 i didnt say there was no god i only said it would have been nice if there was god
7644100 you tell that god is present in every nook and corner
7644101 why do you call me your son am i not radheya i am worse than an orphan what curse is this my mother abandoned me for no fault of mine i was denied the marriage to draupadi because of my supposedly low lineage for no reason i was denied a brothers love or a mothers affection i am the sacrificial animal in the selfish game played by all others
7644102 pardon me for my harsh words father my anger is a result of me being a paradox i am a rightful royal but people consider me a low born i am praised by many for my un selfish nature and intense discipline but yet cursed by rishis at this point of time i only live to serve duryodhan in the best way possible let me at least be a great friend my rival arjuna awaits me today at battle let me give my best at the battle ground i seek your blessings
7644103 pursuing a career in marine technology at the new england institute of technology has been one of the best decisions i have made in my search for an institute of higher education there were no other colleges that could have provided an associates degree in 18 months a bachelors degree in 18 more months and 70 hands on experience new england tech gives me a home away from home feeling the international student office made this all possible they are always there when you need them they listen and guide your every need they make me feel like i am one of their own furthermore the things i enjoy about new england tech are relationship with the students and instructors well planned syllabus and presentation small class sizes organized class times adequate facilities with the experience and the family feeling there was no better place to start my dreams than new england institute of technology
7644104 the it sector grew so quickly that bermuda is still experiencing a skills shortage which has resulted in reliance on foreign labor it is an ideal time for bermudians to acquire the skill sets and experience to take advantage of the career opportunities created from the onset i knew new england tech was the way to go

7644131 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7644132 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7644133 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7644134 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7644135 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7644136 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7644137 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7644138 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7644139 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7644140 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7644174 without the ability to collect publication fees tasmania risks being financially disadvantaged in the national market place by not being able to recoup any of the considerable outlay that will automatically flow from interstate jurisdictions charging tasmania for access to their race fields information
7644175 i believe that the use of this model is the most appropriate and equitable approach
7644176 the tasmanian model will be in contrast to the approach adopted by new south wales which has elected to determine the fee based on a wagering operators turnover

7644279 this is a difficult year in which three markets are slowing down and are not performing as well as they did last year we continued to grow in the first half but the problems on the market in the first six months will catch up with us in the second half this goes for the entire market but speaking exclusively about colliers we set out conservatively to reach the same turnover and profit as in 2007
7644280 whereas early in the year we stated we set out to attain 40 growth i can only say that the target remains the same it remains to be seen whether we reach it or exceed it but i do not want to comment too much on the subject until the end of the year when we draw the line

7644284 it has to do with the subprime crisis most of our customers are multinationals that are being affected by market conditions particularly investment funds that specialise in real estate they are more watchful more acquainted with the situation and are no longer willing to pay any price to buy in the past six months ive seen as much as 20 of the deals in which we provided assistance put on hold we did not witness this phenomenon last year
7644285 i am happy about what has been achieved but there are still things i find inconvenient the most unfortunate thing is that all restrictions apply almost indiscriminately without distinguishing between consumer and mortgage loans
7644286 with the election of the national chairman of the mdc tsvangirai as speaker the people have spoken again they want a change nobody can or will dictate to zimbabweans
7644287 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7644288 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7644289 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law

7644302 nu aveam cum sa intuim evolutia sif urilor din primul semestru exista doua strategii de investitii fie speculezi tendintele din piata pe termen scurt si atunci nu te intereseaza ce rezultate financiare raporteaza compania fie faci plasamente pe termen lung si alegi compania cu rezultatele bune si deci cu potential de crestere noi abordam a doua strategie
7644303 faptul ca mare parte din fondurile de actiuni s au orientat catre sif uri reflecta intentia administratorilor fata de potentialul acestor emitenti deprecierea suferita de sif uri este inexplicabila dar cred insa intr o revenire a acestor titluri in urmatorul an
7644304 nu ai cum sa ocolesti sif urile si bancile cand faci un portofoliu mai ales cand administrezi un volum relativ mare de active sif urile sunt printre putinii emitenti care au un grad ridicat de lichidiate
7644305 banii trebuie investiti in emitenti lichizi care sunt din pacate destul de putini pe piata locala diferenta la randamente vine din emitentii mai putin lichizi listati pe bursa sau rasdaq

7644308 targetul sofitel este de business iar cu ibisul pe care il vom construi vom ataca clasa medie cand am decis sa construim acest hotel am plecat de la faptul ca romexpo are foarte multe targuri pe an iar o parte din participantii la astfel de expozitii nu au posibilitatea de a se caza la patru stele

7644310 sedinta de ieri nu a fost concludenta cum nu a fost de altfel nici cea de vineri volumele au fost in continuare mici cu cateva exceptii pentru primul semestru rezultatele financiare raportate de companii au fost bune desi poate ca unii emitenti se asteptau la rezultate si mai bune acestea nu pot schimba insa imediat piata si probabil ca influenta rezultatelor o vom vedea in timp

7644346 memphis is the capitol of mississippi there is a fair share of disputes settled by knives and guns the scene there is kind of beautifully dysfunctional everybody chasing after everybody s wives and stuff he s put a lot of records out in a short time with evangeline my family was intertwined with william faulkner s the murrys and the faulkners intermarried three or four times

7644753 i think americans are hurting and hurting badly in fact i think americans are not better off than they were eight years ago when you look at whats happened to middle income americans
7644754 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7644755 i have far more experience on the economy than senator obama im very strong on the economy
7644756 i have regretted losing my temper on many occasions but there are things worth getting angry about in politics
7644757 at the smallest provocation i would go off into a mad frenzy and then suddenly crash to the floor unconscious when i got angry i held my breath until i blacked out
7644758 i told you we needed a stage you incompetent little shit when i tell you to do something you do it
7644759 im so glad youre out of a job and ill see to it that you never work again
7644760 if you dont cooperate on this project youll be the shortest tenured supervisor in the history of the forest service
7644761 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
7644762 were going to prevail and we will win and itll be one of the best things thats happened to america and the world in a long time cause itll reverberate throughout the middle east
7644763 were succeeding i dont care what anybody says ive seen the facts on the ground
7644764 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
7644765 it is a shame that the new york times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit and run smear campaign
7644766 i dont know if you can understand this george but that really hurt that really hurt
7644767 those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable
7644768 because germs got in your mouth last night and when they found out how clean it was they decided to throw a party
7644769 those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable
7644770 in the case of any person whose judgement is really deserving of confidence how has it become so because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him to profit by as much of it as was just and to expound to himself and upon occasion to others the fallacy of what was fallacious because he has felt that the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind no wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this nor is it the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner
7644771 under this proposed legislation the publishing of sensitive information defined as threatening the national interest will be a criminal offence if the intention is to prejudice the state included among matters in the national interest are defence and security plans significant political and economic relations with international organisations and foreign governments and details of criminal investigations
7644772 the president acting in consultation with the speaker of the national assembly
7644773 truth does indeed have immense power yet it remains extremely elusive no single person no body of opinion no political or religious doctrine no political party or government can claim to have a monopoly on truth for that reason truth can be arrived at only through the untrammelled contest between and among competing opinions in which as many viewpoints as possible are given a fair and equal hearing it has therefore always been our contention that laws mores practices and prejudices that place constraints on freedom of expression are a disservice to society indeed these are the devices employed by falsehood to lend it strength in its unequal contest with truth
7644774 the partisan engaged in debate cares nothing about what is right but only to persuade others to agree with him
7644775 the aim of debate should not be victory but progress
7644776 true debaters are not therefore partisan they share a concern to arrive at a truth or sound judgement or the best result or an increase of understanding when they criticise and disagree it is the opposing argument and not the opposing arguer they address for they know the reverse technique is a cheap fallacy of logic and wherever they find an opposing argument strong they rejoice to have learned something thereby
7644777 is often in practice indistinct from chauvinism which makes ones own national identity the overriding moral political consideration
7644778 although there are few if any true democracies in the world most dispensations claiming that name are elective oligarchies the democratic spirit nevertheless invests western life for good and ill both the good resides in the pressure to treat everyone fairly the ill resides in the pressure to make everyone alike the latter is a levelling tendency a downward thrust which dislikes excellence because it raises mountains where the negative democratic spirit wishes to see only plains but democracy should not aim to reduce people and their achievements to a common denominator it should aim to raise them ambitiously and dramatically as close as possible to an ideal and that means among other things having institutions especially of learning which are the best and most demanding of their kind
7644779 god expects us to rule this country because we are the only organisation which was blessed by pastors when it was formed it is even blessed in heaven that is why we will rule until jesus comes back we should not allow anyone to govern our city when we are ruling the country
7644780 they will never be allowed to rule this country never ever
7644781 only god who appointed me will remove me only god will remove me
7644782 those that stand in opposition to me or my party are evil and must be opposed for they stand not only in opposition to us but in opposition to god who has appointed and blessed us as his representatives here on earth thus my party will remain in power forever and it will not subscribe to the will of mortal men because it rules by divine right and therefore until the end of time and at gods grace nevertheless those who would oppose me or my party cannot be allowed to govern irrespective of the broader democratic will and we must stand together to prevent this from happening
7644783 the very phrase would seem odd as denoting a deitys disposition of rights to mortal man or woman to rule a portion of earth if belief in it were not an historical reality it is surprising that those who invoked the notion did not see that it rested on nothing more elaborate than the primitive notion that might is right for it is the deitys vast and inexorable power to punish and dispose that enforces the right of a king to rule by supposed dictate of what that deity wills
7644784 i arrived from jordan this morning just after 5 oclock i must say i took advantage of being in jordan to go to the river jordan where jesus was baptised i was around there jericho and jerusalem were just across the dead sea
7644785 the anc will rule south africa until jesus comes back
7644786 anc will rule sa until jesus comes back says zuma
7644787 that is why we believe the anc will be in power forever until the son of man comes back
7644788 god expects us to rule this country because we are the only organisation which was blessed by pastors when it was formed it is even blessed in heaven
7644789 i believe that until a cure for this disease is found
7644790 all i know is that the president of this country since his election has grown in stature in the world he is the leading president on the continent and is invited by all international organisations to come and put the views of the country and of the continent
7644791 in our view our president today is towering he is in fact at the level of presidents in the developed countries he has brought innovation in the debates that have taken place
7644792 as a result of president mbekis activities internationally south africa which is what it was before 1994 has gained 100 recognition indeed
7644793 i do not know what damage the president has caused what i know is that the president asked specific questions which were aimed at getting information from those who know particularly scientists so that government could take informed positions as it works out its policies to deal with this matter
7644794 instead of getting answers there has been the kind of excitement which i do not know where it came from which the hon member calls a damage sic i do not know what has to be repaired because the answers had not come the president went further when there was this excitement invited the experts internationally who came and met in this country and posed the questions to the real people who deal with the business they are working on it in order to help answer the questions that our president has asked
7644795 i do not know what damage one is causing by asking questions i do not understand why people would say there has been a damage sic that needs to be repaired there is absolutely no damage
7644796 i cannot indicate right here how long this will take but we are doing everything we can to encourage people because people have different views and we do not want to exclude those views from what one will finally come up with as a final decision in moving forward this is what we are waiting for
7644797 president mbeki does not need any persuasion he absolutely does not need any persuasion
7644798 it a shower would minimise the risk of contracting the disease
7644799 there are two kinds of bands in los angeles those trying to get signed and those trying to get out of a contract concerts are usually auditions when the band dont care sometimes a little rock n roll sneaks out

7644805 is government engaged in a deliberate war of attrition against its poorest supporters
7644806 a pre eminent place in the history of the struggle of the peoples of southern and east africa for national emancipation and the birth of the new african civilisation
7644807 criticised the united states for taking sides against president robert mugabes government and disrespecting the views of the zimbabwean people
7644808 zimbabwe is the most pressing case in point reflecting a political argument within south africa and a broader philosophical debate the labour movement within the anc led by jacob zuma is close to the opposition mdc in zimbabwe which also has labour roots and is highly critical of mbekis deference to mugabe zumas faction has provided planes to transport mdc leaders the labour faction of the anc is using the zimbabwe crisis to argue that mbeki is yesterdays man indifferent to the cause that gave rise to the anc itself
7644809 i think well be lucky if we have a free election
7644810 the policy of the anc is what we have done in zimbabwe because what has been done in zimbabwe many people think it was just mbeki but we discussed the matters about zimbabwe and he was implementing what the anc had decided we needed to do
7644811 nobody in the world can say they have done better on zimbabwe than south africa
7644812 the people love him so how can we condemn him
7644813 if i were to ask a question it would be what is it about zimbabwe that makes everybody feel so agitated i do not know
7644814 the president of this country has taken a stand firstly he said that he was engaged in opening up discussion through the diplomatic channels that was his first statement on the zimbabwe issue he has moved to become part of the process of finding a solution in zimbabwe now i do not know why we should insist on saying that south africa has not taken any position in practice we are in fact engaged to defuse and solve the problem our president is not about to do political propaganda he is about to ensure that things are done he has moved i think that to keep on raising the issue in a sense exposes some political interest other than the interest of our region
7644815 all i know is that the president of this country since his election has grown in stature in the world he is the leading president on the continent and is invited by all international organisations to come and put the views of the country and of the continent
7644816 it is not in my nature to correct run and monitor presidents of other countries it is not the duty of this country to do so
7644817 we sent observers here who were observing each and every detail
7644818 south africa has done something that other countries have not done it has engaged the zimbabwean government in quiet diplomacy the african charter on human rights guides us on how we should handle our affairs in the continent
7644819 if south africa has not reached that point and if it is engaging zimbabwe and if it has not come to the point that it should do that why should it do it there is no reason why we can do it when we are not convinced we have reached that time as i say
7644820 if i were to ask a question it would be what is it about zimbabwe that makes everybody feel so agitated i do not know let us deal with the matters without mentioning zimbabwe and mention zimbabwe when it is necessary
7644821 i dont think south africa could do more than what it is doing in terms of engaging zimbabweans to discuss the issues that affect zimbabwe and which in the final analysis will have to be resolved by the zimbabweans we believe that progress has been made in that direction so insofar as zimbabwe is concerned we are certain that perceptions will be dealt with or addressed very soon
7644822 we are not in the business of condemning countries because it is not our business to run other countries
7644823 inviting observer missions clearly is an intention of a country that is preparing to have free and fair elections that wants its neighbours and everybody else to come and observe
7644824 the people love him so how can we condemn him
7644825 the policy of the anc is what we have done in zimbabwe because what has been done in zimbabwe many people think it was just mbeki but we discussed the matters about zimbabwe and he was implementing what the anc had decided we needed to do
7644826 and i can tell you nobody in the world can say they have done better on zimbabwe than us because nobody can produce any report of any significance as to what it is they have done to help zimbabwe out of the problem some will tell you theyve applied sanctions have they helped some will say we have condemned him has it helped we engaged with zimbabweans partly precisely because of that concern that we knew that to us the zimbabwean issue was not remote
7644827 we are not in the business of condemning countries because it is not our business to run other countries
7644828 we must also intensify the struggle to eliminate the remnants of counter revolution which include the da and a loose coalition of those who want to use state power to block the anc presidents ascendancy to the highest office of the land
7644829 there will be blood in the courtroom if they reinstate the charges
7644830 we are prepared to take up arms and kill for zuma
7644831 because jacob zuma is one of us and he is one of our leaders for him we are prepared to lay our lives and to shoot and kill
7644832 are we in a jungle when duly elected members of the anc are threatened with violence and death
7644833 hiv it doesnt exist the kind of stories that they tell that people are dying in droves its not true its not borne out by any facts where the science has not proved anything we cannot allow our people to be guinea pigs anti retrovirals theyre quite dangerous theyre poison actually
7644834 mokaba became famous or infamous for his frequently shouted slogan at mass political gatherings in the 1980s and early 1990s kill the farmer kill the boer
7644835 nobody anywhere in our country whoever they are has a right to call for the killing of any south african whatever the colour race ethnic origin gender or health condition of the intended victim
7644836 no evidence exists to suggest that the anc encouraged either directly or indirectly the chanting of the slogan at either of the events
7644837 we have made it quite clear that kill the boer kill the farmer is not and was never a cosatu slogan we understand how those protesters were feeling and we believe in the rule of the law and that the law should take its course
7644838 you must kill the bastards if they threaten you or the community you must not worry about the regulations that is my responsibility your responsibility is to serve and protect i want to assure the police station commissioners and policemen and women from these areas that they have permission to kill these criminals i wont tolerate any pathetic excuses for you not being able to deal with crime you have been given guns now use them i want no warning shots you have one shot and it must be a kill shot if you miss the criminals will go for the kill the constitution says criminals must be kept safe but i say no i say we must protect the law abiding people and not the criminals i say that criminals must be made to pay for their crimes
7644839 governments position is that every action taken by the police must happen within the regulatory framework so there is no possibility that the police can be expected to operate outside the law
7644840 not going to waste his time with the human rights champions of yesterday
7644841 umshini wami belongs to the anc who are these people abusing this song while they are doing wrong things

7644843 mankind are great gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each other to live as seems good to the rest
7644844 tolerance is not only the centrepiece but the paradox of liberalism for liberalism enjoins tolerance of opposing viewpoints and allows them to have their say leaving it open to the democracy of ideas to decide which shall prevail the result is too often the death of toleration itself because those who live by hard principles and uncompromising views in political moral and religious respects always if given half a chance silence liberals because liberalism by its nature threatens the hegemony they wish to impose to the question should the tolerant tolerate the intolerant the answer should therefore be a resounding no tolerance has to protect itself

7644937 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7644938 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7644939 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7644940 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7644941 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7644942 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7644943 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7644944 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7644945 i dont want to go to the doctor because im so sick
7644946 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7644947 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7644948 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7644949 with all the stuff going on around denver that is full of exclamation points this one is a little bit different what this is is a place for quiet contemplation at the democratic national convention
7644950 you dont practice meditation just to get zoomed out and think of nothing or get peaceful or something
7644951 the whole purpose being to become more clear so that we dont tend to react as a knee jerk
7644952 during the convention i would like for the posturing and proselytizing that takes place to come up against a moment of thoughtfulness
7644953 meditation is all about clarifying your motivation the attitude you take when you take action
7644954 so getting back to politicians what are their intentions when they legislate are they legislating out of greed hatred and delusion and believe me those are real motivators legislating out of anger i think there is a real place for meditation in contemplative politics
7644955 with just a little more effort we could return people to the moon by july 20 2019 which would be very significant is there any talk of this as a goal
7644956 i have not heard any discussion of a 50th anniversary goal at the time of the declaration of the vision for space exploration at the beginning of 2004 i think it could have happened however the failure of the constellation budget to meet expectations over the past couple of years and the currently projected shortfalls in the upcoming years effectively make itimpossible originally the cev was intended to go into service to the iss in 2010 at the retirement of the shuttle i havent been keeping track but i think the gap is now five years between shuttle retirement and cev operation
7644957 we never in a million years expected anything like this to happen
7644958 this is a berlin heart and it has um four tubes that help my heart
7644959 without it blake wouldnt be here now but theres risk of stroke of bleeding of infection
7644960 you dont have all the data i think thats what makes the openers always exciting
7644961 there is that element of the unknown it can be nerve racking its part of the game both sides go through it
7644962 having extra motivation being picked last by everybody thats fine with us
7644963 were perfectly happy being underdogs game in and game out we feel like maybe some teams will overlook us or look to the next game and we can sneak up and stun some people
7644964 id like to think were a little more talented than weve been
7644965 weve got a number of players who have played a lot of football a year ago we were playing with nine freshmen who were involved in ballgames regularly you add that to your experienced group and youd like to think that youll benefit some from all of that
7644966 each in their own way have done good things and well kind of figure out how thats going to come about later in the week we will need all three of those guys to carry their load throughout the season
7644967 theres a great anticipation on their part to get going
7644968 its been a long time since theyve played a real football game
7644969 oh i just wear them every once in a while whenever the mood strikes me
7644970 i have kept a consistent position on right to life amp i havent changed my position on even numbered years or have changed because of a different offices im running for
7644971 what i try to take in to every speech is just be yourself and thats easy to do as long as i dont have to be anybody other than michelle obama i figure i know me better than anybody and i can do that pretty well
7644972 i knew before you knew gayle i knew before you did but thats all ill say but people ask did i play a role absolutely not i always tell him this is your choice you will be the president of the united states and youve got to have somebody that you can trust that you think will have your back that believes in you i give the general advice is the person a good man
7644973 when i told the girls who the choice was i said its this man named senator biden and malia our oldest said well is he nice and we said yes hes a very nice man i met his family and he believes in family and he works hard and then she said is he smart and i said hes very smart she was like well if hes a nice man and hes smart then it sounds like a good decision
7644974 the one thing that i can tell people is barack has not disappointed me once in the 20 years or more that ive known him not once and thats the only reason why i can be sitting here
7644975 my tray went out of control well how can you control a food tray so i hit several snowdrifts but its so much fun
7644976 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7644977 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7644978 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7644979 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7644980 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7644981 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7644982 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7644983 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7644984 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
7644985 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges
7644986 if the people knew what we had done they would chase us down the street and lynch us
7644987 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges
7644988 above all we need to inform the public about how psychopaths co opt and corrupt normal human beings one way they do this is by manipulating shame and denial emotions foreign to psychopaths but common and easily induced among normals emphasis mine
7644989 the prevailing recipe for civilization is simple 1 use lies and brainwashing to create an army of controlled systematic mass murderers 2 use that army to enslave large numbers of people i e seize control of their labour power and its fruits 3 use that slave labour power to improve the brainwashing process by using the economic surplus to employ scribes priests and pr men then go back to step one and repeat the process psychopaths have played a disproportionate role in the development of civilization because they are hard wired to lie kill injure and generally inflict great suffering on other humans without feeling any remorse
7644990 we have learned that beach closings in this area are up 30 percent and illinois ranks number one in the number of beach closings in the united states
7644991 the economic loss as the result of closing one lake michigan beach ranges from 9 000 to 37 000 per day
7644992 we expect based on this report we are releasing today that 300 people can expect to contract respiratory illnesses after swimming in lake michigan
7644993 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7644994 subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7644995 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7644996 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices

7645014 but jessica was my only friend and now shes gone
7645015 we dont think he will be part of our game plan
7645016 it will be a week to week kind of situation to see how his condition progresses
7645017 we are pretty confident it is not going to be significant amount of time
7645018 by significant i mean three or four weeks at the most we are optimistic it will be sooner than that

7645021 electing john mccain would be a mistake for our country that is the overriding reality anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with senator obama than they will ever have with senator mccain and the republican party i have been consistent in delivering that message that is what i will be doing here
7645022 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7645023 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed

7645025 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7645026 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7645027 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7645028 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7645029 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7645030 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7645031 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7645032 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7645033 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7645034 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7645035 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7645036 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7645037 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7645038 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7645039 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7645040 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7645041 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7645042 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7645043 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7645044 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7645045 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7645046 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7645047 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial

7645051 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7645052 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7645053 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7645054 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7645055 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers

7645060 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7645061 through secondary schooling derrick was always in the bottom sets as black pupils were not allowed to be in the top sets at that time he always wanted to be a male nurse but he came to realise that he could not cope with the hospital environment he changed direction and went to university but he was thrown out after a year and trained as an electrician in applying for an electrician post with wolverhampton borough council he was offered a job as an officer
7645062 slavery and the slave trade cemented the relations between africa europe and the americas into one of inequality the industrial revolution in england lies at the heart of this change and places like west bromwich and smethwick were an important part of it profit made from the enslavement of millions of africans fuelled the rise of the iron industry canals and estates like warley woods the fight by black people and other abolitionists against slavery created an important legacy of opposition to racism and inequality

7645073 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7645074 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7645075 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now

7645101 when the wine writer entered the shop and looked at the shelves we thought nothing too unusual about it but when he lifted the bottle of pinotage we knew something was not right the he strolled to the till just like that as if it was the most normal thing on earth and took out his wallet it was then i saw jessica turning pale
7645102 when miss bertram saw he was actually going to pay for the wine she just collapsed the shock was obviously very big and i must admit i was not feeling very steady myself it was a ghastly site him standing there with his smile and r20 note
7645103 a wine writer buying his own wine is an oddity in itself but minnaar who is especially skilled at accepting the freebie just has to be careful he cant just flash his wallet about in public with innocent bystanders looking on i always believed it had the potential of leading to something serious as has just been the case
7645104 what are some of these optimization tactics it can be as simple as uploading a video to youtube that also resides on your web site or landing page according to steve espinosa director of product development for elocallisting when google sees that the copy and meta data surrounding your video is the same as the equivalent youtube clip it will rank your video and landing page higher as part of its increasing favorability of youtube content
7645105 it doesnt matter if you win or loose as long as we beat new zealand

7645128 tata motors had been working on a new platform since 2005 and indica vista is the first vehicle to be rolled out based on this platform it will also be used to roll out the next generation indigo
7645129 the first indigo was launched three years after the indica however the next generation indigo will come earlier probably in 18 24 months
7645130 once the companys ramp up operations stabilize and the market picks up india vista is expected to surpass the earlier average sales of indica a month at 12 000 units
7645131 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term

7645137 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life
7645138 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7645139 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office

7645179 b b lhistoire est v ridique ne laisse personne essayer de te dire autre chose
7645180 what the world honors is detestable in the sight of god
7645181 the commodity form of life touches us systematically it cuts across every human activity for there is an economics of intimacy and happiness covenanted love is not very profitable there is an economics of the vows poverty chastity and obedience are not very helpful to economic growth there is an economics to prayer and solitude they are financially worthless
7645182 a culture that is sustained by and sustains the commodity form of consciousness for example will relate to personal reality as a hostile deviant or heretical force thus today many christian values chastity pacifism family life are seen as deviant mysterious or strangely primitive consequently those who embrace such values often find themselves under such great pressure that they must either accept the reality of the dominant commodity values or acquiesce in their own lives as laughably deviant
7645183 freeing ourselves from an intoxication to material or outward things and becoming sensitive to the things of the spirit especially our inward condition
7645184 but when we live out of the divine center thoughts and decisions flow from the fountainhead each decision is ordered and governed by him
7645185 if any person wills to come after me let him deny himself disown himself forget lose sight of himself and his own interests refuse and give up himself and take up his cross daily and follow me cleave steadfastly to me conform wholly to my example in living and if need be in dying also for whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it but whoever loses his life for my sake he will preserve and save it from the penalty of eternal death
7645186 only those who throw away their lives for my sake and for the sake of the good news will ever know what it means to truly live
7645187 a constant choosing of receptivity to gods activity a continuous availability to gods ability
7645188 christian behavior however is not a self produced self generated self actuated activity whereby a christian strives to succeed at the project of christian living in accord with some proceduralized
7645189 that you may really come to know practically through experience for yourselves the love of christ which far surpasses mere knowledge without experience that you may be filled through all your being unto all
7645190 but if we really are living and walking in the light as he himself is in the light we have true unbroken fellowship with one another
7645191 your strong love for each other will prove to the world that you are my disciples
7645192 nothing absolutely nothing on the face of the earth compares with the advanced possession of god in deep prayer
7645193 happiness is found not in things but in persons and especially in the divine person
7645194 a consuming concern for the kingdom our minds are to be raised from the things of earth to those of heaven
7645195 we are to be head over heels in love for god people in love are not much concerned with things they are person oriented not thing centered
7645196 the rich man is blinded by his clingings he not only does not do what he ought to do with his wealth he does not even see what he ought to do
7645197 as people are more or less immersed in the world they are more or less obtuse regarding god
7645198 a man concerned with things is not concerned with the supernatural realm if silent love is burning within there will appear a disinterest in material things without this man is interested in peoples hearts not in himself
7645199 the one who seeks created things beyond what he needs will not attain mystical love
7645200 the word of god is smothered choked and does not reach maturity in people who succumb to cares pleasures and wealth
7645201 let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money including greed avarice lust and craving for earthly possessions and be satisfied with your present circumstances and with what you have
7645202 for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness
7645203 do not love this world nor the things it offers you for when you love the world you do not have the love of the father in you
7645204 it is to live a life dominated by the senses it is to be gluttonous in food effeminate in luxury slavish in pleasure lustful and lax in morals selfish in the use of possessions regardless of all the spiritual values extravagant in the gratification of material desires
7645205 anyone who lives in luxury while others live in want anyone who has made a god of his own comfort
7645206 the tendency to be captivated by outward show the spirit which can see nothing without wishing to acquire it and which having acquired it flaunts it it is the spirit which believes that happiness is to be found in the things money can buy and the eye can see it has no values other than the material
7645207 but it also teaches a rich abundant human living a complete and intense joy beyond understanding a joy no one can take away a rejoicing in the lord always a tasting of the very goodness of uncreated beauty
7645208 we basically hunger not for things but for everything the originating fountain we hunger for truth we thirst to drink beauty we yearn to celebrate we seek to delight we stretch out to love and be loved
7645209 for you say i am rich i have prospered and grown wealthy and i am in need of nothing and you do not realize and understand that you are spiritually wretched pitiable poor blind and naked
7645210 our consumer culture persistently teaches that we can counter insecurity by buying our way to self esteem and loveworthiness the pervasive message is that we will feel better about ourselves if we are surrounded by symbols of worth
7645211 the infinite longing of the human heart has been introjected into products the newest the best the costliest the always interminably improved our malls are cathedrals of consumption eternity is found in calvin klein bottles infiniti in a japanese automobile ones heart no longer a throne wherein the transcendent personal god might dwell no longer engaged by a knowing and loving trinitarian encounter of other persons is restless until it rests now anchored or even chained by the promise of possessions thus accumulation is king
7645212 our ideology has substituted consumption and marketing for the development and realization of human persons
7645213 a culture whose people have lost all sense of their interior lives
7645214 the culture of lost interiority is paradoxically a culture of lost intimacy
7645215 the commodity form affects us at every level of our existence our fear of solitude which is one with the fragmentation of individual identity our valuing of ourselves solely in terms of external criteria is beneficial to the commodified way of life our lack of intimacy community personally enduring relationships our sense of competition and lack of solidarity nudge us into possessing and accumulating things in order to fill up the lack we experience by missing persons in our lives our sense of powerlessness in changing the social system and its disordered priorities only serves to confirm and support our economic way of life our inability to live simply to enjoy life without a continual sense of craving and dissatisfaction is good news for economic growth our ignorance of the poor and the disenfranchised our fear of encountering them in truth intensifies our flight from our own vulnerability and the truth of our own creaturehood
7645216 guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness the immoderate desire for wealth the greedy longing to have more for a mans life does not consist and is not derived from possessing overflowing abundance or that which is over and above his needs
7645217 our being is in having our happiness is in possessing more
7645218 so kill all greed and covetousness for that is idolatry the deifying of self and other created things instead of god
7645219 we not only relate to things as if they were substitute persons we relate to them as if they were our gods giving us meaning purpose and a reason for living
7645220 their gods are merely man made things of silver and of gold they cant talk or see despite their eyes and mouths nor can they hear nor smell nor use their hands or feet nor speak and those who make and worship them are just as foolish as their idols are
7645221 for their love of idols was adultery in the sight of god
7645222 for as you think in your heart so are you
7645223 i loose myself from every bond shackle chain or fetter
7645224 i loose mary or john from every yoke of bondage
7645225 behold i have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions and physical and mental strength and ability over all the power that the enemy possesses and nothing shall in any way harm you
7645226 i resist all stress and pressure i have all the time i need to do all that god is calling me to do
7645227 however when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another they are without understanding and behave unwisely
7645228 i am not moved by what i see or by how things seem or appear but only by the way the word depicts reality
7645229 have the roots of your being firmly and deeply planted in him fixed and founded in him being continually built up in him becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith
7645230 i clothe apron myself with humility as the garb of a servant so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from me with freedom from pride and arrogance toward one another for god sets himself against the proud he opposes frustrates and defeats them but gives grace favor blessing to the humble
7645231 that the living may know that the most high god rules the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whomever he will and sets over it the humblest and lowliest of men
7645232 go down low serve wash feet or minister to people
7645233 do not judge and criticize and condemn others so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves
7645234 i lean not to my own understanding in all my ways i acknowledge him and he shall direct my paths
7645235 consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting but the things that are unseen are deathless and everlasting
7645236 any path outside of my cross is a path of deception
7645237 apart from me cut off from vital union with me you can do nothing
7645238 the religious spirit is unsettled when people rely on the holy spirit because when they do it threatens to expose this spirits insidious nature and undermine its base of power and influence in order to prevent this threat from becoming reality the religious spirit seeks to undermine discourage and destroy those who seek to speak words of life
7645239 those professing saints were so dull to god that they flooded their senses with what their appetites demanded only to be further dulled
7645240 designed to satisfy our self righteousness to satisfy our self pre eminence to satisfy our self indulgence to satisfy our self esteem to satisfy our self importance in the realm of religiosity
7645241 religious spirits and controlling spirits are alike theyre twin brothers
7645242 however we possess this precious treasure the divine light of the gospel in frail human vessels of earth that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from god and not from ourselves
7645243 self ambition self reliance self assertion self centeredness self realization self defense self confidence self satisfaction self determination self importance self indulgence self interest the esteeming of the self self conscientiousness self pity and on and on and on
7645244 now that you have by obeying the truth made your souls clean enough for a genuine love of your fellows
7645245 a heart that the lord can use to flow through
7645246 jesus says there are many who think they are saved but who only have religion religion can separate you from god for eternity
7645247 for the ransom of a life is too costly and the price one can pay can never suffice so that he should live on forever and never see the pit the grave and corruption
7645248 he who is wise captures human lives for god as a fisher of men he gathers and receives them for eternity
7645249 know his will and approve the things that are excellent being instructed out of the law
7645250 go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news the gospel to every creature of the whole human race
7645251 i have food nourishment to eat of which you know nothing
7645252 i am very certain that people at fifa and the confederation of african football caf are understanding enough not to sanction such a match
7645253 if anything we will still be mourning our president since the period has now been extended to 21 days
7645254 its our prayer as government that our request will be heard
7645255 i saw flesh and body parts flying through the sky
7645256 the walls covered with blood even the teacups filled with blood
7645257 i blame the iraqi government for this security deterioration because it started to chase sahweh leaders out of the city
7645258 the constituency consists of 69 percent malay 25 percent chinese and the remainder being indian if you look at the malay vote if he manages to woo them if he manages to pull 70 strong to 80 percent many people in umno would jump because they would see that he controls the malay support
7645259 if you jump sooner then you can hope to get a position in his new government you jump later he may not even pick you
7645260 the umno machinery has been playing up ethnic sentiments to its height they openly compare chinese as pigs
7645261 you never do that publicly never put that in a campaign and this time around umno used that in a malay area hoping that would push up the malay support to create that sense that if you have anwar winning the chinese and the indians are going to dominate the country
7645262 bad attitude and poor work ethic should not get the same tip as a hard working passionate worker
7645263 if you dont like having to rely on tips to survive because your job doesnt pay enough on its own then dont blame me
7645264 it would be great to have a rover explore these deposits because they may be one of the few places where water is periodically present in the recent past this could have implications for biology
7645265 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7645266 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7645267 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7645268 they went apparently with the intent to conduct a cordon and search because of allegations there may have been weapons in the camp
7645269 the government has been waiting for an opportunity to close the camp down
7645270 if people start to have the feeling that the war has been taken to the camps then youre talking about a tinderbox
7645271 the government wants to evacuate the camp by any means peacefully or by force
7645272 kalma is seen as a stronghold and thats why the government targeted this camp
7645273 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7645274 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7645275 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7645276 mit den geschlossenen b rsen in england fehlen wichtige teilnehmer
7645277 its going to be a heavy lift it takes time in our system
7645278 anything that raises the price of electricity is going to be a political problem
7645279 now faith is the assurance the confirmation the title deed of the things we hope for being the proof of things we do not see
7645280 the king james actually uses the word substance to describe faith
7645281 according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith
7645282 i assure you most solemnly i tell you that unless a person is born again anew from above he cannot ever see know be acquainted with and experience the kingdom of god
7645283 for we walk by faith thus we walk not by sight or appearance
7645284 since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting
7645285 from beginning to end of your christian life it is always sinful to indulge in doubts doubts and discouragements are all from an evil source and are always untrue
7645286 the will or purpose to doubt must be surrendered exactly as you surrender the will or purpose to yield to any other temptation
7645287 but deny yourself take up your cross in this matter and quietly but firmly refuse ever to listen to a single word
7645288 fight the good fight of faith lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and for which you confessed the good confession of faith
7645289 faith comes or increases by hearing and hearing by the word of god
7645290 for whatever a man sows that and that only is what he will reap he who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life
7645291 he calleth those things which be not as though they were
7645292 he speaks of the nonexistent things that he has foretold and promised as if they already existed
7645293 through this principle of confession we dont deny what exists we just dont give it first place dont continually talk much about what exists especially if it doesnt agree with gods word for the more we talk it the more we will believe it the more we will believe it the more we will talk it faith and fear both come by hearing
7645294 it is an inexorable rule in the spiritual life that according to our faith it is to be unto us this rule of course must work both ways and therefore we may fairly expect that it will be also unto us according to our doubts
7645295 the carnal attitude sees no further than natural things but the spiritual attitude reaches out after the things of the spirit the former attitude means bluntly death the latter means life and inward peace
7645296 i have been crucified with christ in him i have shared his crucifixion it is no longer i who live but christ the messiah lives in me and the life i now live in the body i live by faith in by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in the son of god who loved me and gave himself up for me
7645297 eat gods word read it think about it and grow strong in the lord
7645298 i have esteemed and treasured the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
7645299 the people who know their god shall prove themselves strong and shall stand firm and do exploits for god
7645300 the secret of the sweet satisfying companionship of the lord have they who fear revere and worship him and he will show them his covenant and reveal to them its deep inner meaning
7645301 no prayer no power little prayer little power much prayer much power
7645302 he who speaks in a strange tongue edifies and improves himself
7645303 do not fret or have any anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition definite requests with thanksgiving continue to make your wants known to god and gods peace shall be yours that tranquil state which transcends all understanding
7645304 set your minds and keep them set on what is above the higher things
7645305 enables us to hear god more clearly and to work in increased authority and power
7645306 even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness
7645307 i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
7645308 so then brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live
7645309 now the doings practices of the flesh are clear obvious they are immorality impurity indecency idolatry sorcery anger ill temper selfishness divisions dissensions party spirit factions sects with peculiar opinions heresies envy drunkenness carousing and the like
7645310 but when you follow your own wrong inclinations your lives will produce these evil results impure thoughts eagerness for lustful pleasure idolatry spiritism that is encouraging the activity of demons hatred and fighting jealousy and anger constant effort to get the best for your self complaints and criticisms the feeling that everyone else is wrong except those in your own little group and there will be wrong doctrine envy murder drunkenness wild parties and all that sort of thing
7645311 all of these tendencies are based upon a self reliant attitude of the man who puts his trust in his own strength and in that which is controllable by him there is something in us in our flesh which wants to be god this desire to take gods place to be our own god is foundational to our difficulties in this life
7645312 but the fruit of the holy spirit the work which his presence within accomplishes is love joy gladness peace patience an even temper forbearance kindness goodness benevolence faithfulness gentleness meekness humility self control self restraint continence
7645313 however we possess this precious treasure in frail human vessels of earth that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from god and not from ourselves
7645314 we know that our old unrenewed self was nailed to the cross with him in order that our body which is the instrument of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil that we might no longer be the slaves of sin
7645315 for the desires of the flesh are opposed to the holy spirit and the desires of the spirit are opposed to the flesh godless human nature for these are antagonistic to each other continually withstanding and in conflict with each other
7645316 even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken but alive to god living in unbroken fellowship with him in christ jesus
7645317 i have been crucified with christ in him i have shared his crucifixion it is no longer i who live but christ the messiah lives in me and the life i now live in the body i live by faith in by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in the son of god who loved me and gave himself up for me
7645318 impatience is crucified with christ i reckon or consider impatience dead
7645319 soul humble yourself before the lord my pride is crucified with christ pride no longer reigns in me but christ reigns in me
7645320 but if through the power of the holy spirit you are habitually putting to death making extinct deadening the evil deeds prompted by the body you shall really and genuinely live forever
7645321 walk and live habitually in the holy spirit responsive to and controlled and guided by the spirit then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and the desires of the flesh of human nature without god
7645322 but offer and yield yourselves to god as though you have been raised from the dead to perpetual life and your bodily members and faculties to god presenting them as implements of righteousness
7645323 search me thoroughly o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there is any wicked or hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
7645324 the heart is deceitful above all things and it is exceedingly perverse and corrupt and severely mortally sick who can know it perceive understand be acquainted with his own heart and mind
7645325 the sole possibility of overcoming the enemy demonic forces is to yield the natural life to death
7645326 its not useful to talk about the past were at war now and we have win it
7645327 barack just end all the speculation and prove your eligibility
7645328 the reason i picked a true conservative southern person for my vp is to give balance to my administration and convince the party that most of them have not been disenfranchised
7645329 god d america faith of his radical pastor and that the dems really do deep down somewhere have warm and fuzzy feelings for the evangelicals that keep pushing their nemises into the white house with what has become alarming regularity over the past 30 years but i digress
7645330 we have a great relationship with unm and have worked with them on many projects in the past
7645331 this service allows for better access to the games freeing up parking and reducing congestion on busy streets
7645332 its totally how someone brings it up its just like a child
7645333 they are a living thing and like humans there are some good ones and there are some bad ones some people say their dog would never be aggressive but i think that could be brought out in most of them
7645334 humans like dogs are very social and you need to have certain rules of engagement otherwise there is complete chaos
7645335 people are interpreting morality in that sense when they look at dogs but they could well be very basic fundamental behaviours that animals exhibit
7645336 hear this you that trample on the needy and bring ruin to the poor of the land saying when will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain we will make the ephah small and the shekel great and practice deceit with false balances buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and selling the sweepings of the wheat
7645337 i believe we can meet our gift goal from members whose own personal finances are so insulated from the ups and downs of the market that the state of the economy has no connection to their lives their future or their ability to give generously to a campaign
7645338 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7645339 i was tortured four times after matches one time after a friendly match against jordan in amman that we lost 2 0 uday had me and three teammates taken to the prison when we arrived they took off our shirts tied our feet together and pulled our knees over a bar as we lay on our backs then they dragged us over pavement and concrete pulling the skin off our backs then they pulled us through a sandpit to get sand in our backs finally they made us climb a ladder and jump into a vat of raw sewage they wanted to get our wounds infected the next day and for every day we were there they beat our feet my punishment because i was a star player was 20 lashings per day i asked the guard how he could ever forgive himself he laughed and told me if he didnt do this uday would do it to him uday made us athletes an example he believed that if people saw he was not afraid to beat a hero that they would live in greater fear
7645340 ioc leaders have tried to call the timing of our complaint suspicious and suggest it is part of an anti saddam agenda
7645341 the real question should be why didnt you do something about this years ago it is not as if weve uncovered something no one has ever heard of and they know it it almost seems that theyre thinking that if they wait long enough the u s will invade and they wont have to deal with this issue
7645342 important to remember these are just allegations and you have to make sure this is not all tied to the iraq u s dispute that we are not being used for propaganda you just never know
7645343 those athletes who have been training they phoned me today and they were crying and were very upset
7645344 we are very disappointed that the athletes have been so ill served by their own governments actions
7645345 would you like to have a beer with this guy

7645396 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7645397 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe

7645411 mormon women are after all a self selected group of people whose beliefs are at least somewhat compatible with church teachings

7645473 in unserer macho gesellschaft gilt es als schande f r den vater wenn sein sohn zu weiblich heranw chst
7645474 es kommt vor dass leute ihren job verlieren weil sie schwul sind und viele psychologen versuchen homosexuelle zu heilen
7645475 aber sie verlangt dass ich mich unauff llig verhalte um vor den nachbarn den schein zu wahren
7645476 erst war das parlament 18 monate lang geschlossen dann hatten wir zwei monate lang keine regierung wie sollen wir uns unter diesen bedingungen daf r einsetzen dass das gesetz gegen homosexualit t abgeschafft wird
7645477 hier trifft man alle m glichen leute christen schiiten sunniten normalerweise bleiben die konfessionen unter sich hier feiern alle zusammen
7645478 zudem kommen jede menge golf araber auf der suche nach homosexuellem sex
7645479 der samstagabend ist der einzige moment an dem ich ich selbst sein kann
7645480 da drau en kann ich niemandem sagen dass ich schwul bin nicht einmal meinen freunden
7645481 ich habe zuerst mit helem zusammengearbeitet dann aber wurde mir klar dass die sache der lesben viel mehr mit frauen als mit schwulenrechten zu tun hat
7645482 hier hat eine frau nicht einmal das recht ber ihre eigene sexualit t zu bestimmen unter diesen bedingungen ist es unm glich sich f r die anerkennung von lesben einzusetzen

7645485 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7645486 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7645487 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7645488 was chatting with him davis that late autumn afternoon as dunham and barry obama approached
7645489 its possible he briefly went back to indonesia before actually starting at the school
7645490 frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7645491 bridges of course always denied party membership and attempts were made to deport him because he was a communist he was born in australia but he was able to fight back because he had very very sharp shyster lawyers and a lot of friends in the u s government that helped him and they prevented his deportation but he had been a major force promoting communism
7645492 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
7645493 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
7645494 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
7645495 left himself some wiggle room not least i suppose because of the possibility of prosecution
7645496 the objective of this exercise was to practice and improve coordination and cooperation between the forces

7645571 but we must have scientific fact and empirical data in order to make intelligent and informed decisions
7645572 he thinks hes a victim of society who doesnt like people sexually offending against others
7645573 oooooh this would be a good place to leave comments
7645574 i think the group just follows others around to harass them
7645575 while such groups as roar 4 freedom and sosen work to both educate and teach how to prevent csa from occurring
7645576 feed the public false and misleading fake information in a lame attempt to discredit the information for prevention is taken from as being fake
7645577 as far as your affiliation well we both know the group s you belong to
7645578 you talk about hrws report saying that 13 of the new crimes are commited by registered sex offenders you dont do math very well
7645579 if you take hrws information the we have 600 000 rsos x 13 78 000 which is 00026 of the population
7645580 there are some who say that we are becoming unnecessarily panicky about child sexual abuse the evidence is that we have not panicked enough
7645581 overwhelmingly the evidence shows that sex offenders do recidivate and in substantial numbers
7645582 the majority of child sex offenders will not reoffend as far as we know during their lifetime
7645583 dont worry about me mom and dad i know god will deliver me
7645584 go to sosen us or eadvocate and ask for information on scientific facts in reference to first offense sex offender recidivist rates
7645585 perverted justice absolute zero and wasp people stop your asinine assaults you nazis
7645586 we will win in the end because theses laws are unconstitutional they are punishment pure and simple
7645587 i am using the figures that you have quoted in the hrw report
7645588 and by the way flowergirl is a phd got me a phd
7645589 last i heard only 10 of sex offenses in a given year were committed by someone who has offended before
7645590 god have mercy on our children they have been preyed upon long enough
7645591 the rates actually dropped prior to all this sex offender legislation prior to megans law look it up these laws have absolutely nothing to do with a drop in recidivism nothing
7645592 who in their right mind could mock someones child sexual abuse it boggles the mind
7645593 your a fool and every time you open your mouth you prove it
7645594 it takes a humbleness and a heart that knows it has sinned
7645595 no offense stitches but do you honestly take anything cheryl says seriously
7645596 i could care less about the tax issue but the statement
7645597 some of them are associated with members of girlchat and boychat specifically zman who has a relationship with holokitty the notorious pedophile and one of the ring leaders of butterflykisses of course who knows what will happen now that her partner the child molester gabriel macisaac known as flickorna has been identified then you have shirley lowery who spread propaganda on behalf of dylan thomas the webmaster of boychat the most active and dangerous pedophile on the internet what more proof do you need about the kinds of people who are members of sosen and roar than that
7645598 i think this person is a sosen impostor real sex offenders can lie better than this
7645599 yes i can find research that gives a large recidivist rate but every time it will include parole violations and other non sexual crimes and violations
7645600 go to sosen us or eadvocate and ask for information on scientific facts
7645601 chesterc you should also see that the good doctor in the article you quote says
7645602 and dr bill glaser is not the authority on anything
7645603 what they need to do is rethink their entire plan because the one theyve got doesnt work
7645604 i do not lie nor do i twist things around like you do think about that sweet dreams
7645605 too funny dont know if you are kidding or not but they all sure do sound the same

7645607 as she became increasingly frail many of her friends and colleagues became extraordinarily considerate when dealing with the new lady t the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7645608 i had to keep giving her the bad news again and again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh
7645609 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7645610 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7645611 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7645666 und er gab den einen das apostelamt andere setzte er als propheten ein andere als evangelisten andere als hirten und lehrer um die heiligen f r die erf llung ihres dienstes zu r sten f r den aufbau des leibes christi so sollen wir alle zur einheit im glauben und in der erkenntnis des sohnes gottes gelangen damit wir zum vollkommenen menschen werden und christus in seiner vollendeten gestalt darstellen wir sollen nicht mehr unm ndige kinder sein ein spiel der wellen hin und her getrieben von jedem widerstreit der meinungen dem betrug der menschen ausgeliefert der verschlagenheit die in die irre f hrt wir wollen uns von der liebe geleitet an die wahrheit halten und in allem wachsen bis wir ihn erreicht haben er christus ist das haupt durch ihn wird der ganze leib zusammengef gt und gefestigt in jedem einzelnen gelenk jedes tr gt mit der kraft die ihm zugemessen ist so w chst der leib und wird in liebe aufgebaut
7645667 sie sind nicht von der welt gleichwie auch ich nicht von der welt bin heilige sie in deiner wahrheit dein wort ist wahrheit gleichwie du mich in die welt gesandt hast so sende auch ich sie in die welt und ich heilige mich selbst f r sie damit auch sie geheiligt seien in wahrheit ich bitte aber nicht f r diese allein sondern auch f r die welche durch ihr wort an mich glauben werden auf da sie alle eins seien gleichwie du vater in mir und ich in dir auf da auch sie in uns eins seien damit die welt glaube da du mich gesandt hast und ich habe die herrlichkeit die du mir gegeben hast ihnen gegeben auf da sie eins seien gleichwie wir eins sind ich in ihnen und du in mir auf da sie zu vollendeter einheit gelangen damit die welt erkenne da du mich gesandt hast und sie liebst gleichwie du mich liebst
7645668 deswegen beuge ich meine knie vor dem vater unsres herrn jesus christus nach welchem jede vaterschaft im himmel und auf erden genannt wird da er euch nach dem reichtum seiner herrlichkeit verleihe an kraft zuzunehmen durch seinen geist am inwendigen menschen da christus durch den glauben in euren herzen wohne damit ihr in liebe gewurzelt und gegr ndet mit allen heiligen zu begreifen verm get welches die breite die l nge die h he und die tiefe sei und die liebe christi erkennet die doch alle erkenntnis bertrifft auf da ihr erf llt werdet bis zur ganzen f lle gottes
7645669 nun freue ich mich in den leiden f r euch und erdulde stellvertretend an meinem fleisch was noch fehlte an den tr bsalen christi f r seinen leib welcher ist die gemeinde deren diener ich geworden bin gem dem verwalteramt gottes das mir f r euch gegeben worden ist da ich das wort gottes voll ausrichten soll n mlich das geheimnis das vor den zeitaltern und geschlechtern verborgen war nun aber seinen heiligen geoffenbart worden ist denen gott kundtun wollte welches der reichtum der herrlichkeit dieses geheimnisses unter den v lkern sei n mlich christus in euch die hoffnung der herrlichkeit
7645670 wir wissen da wir aus gott sind und die ganze welt im argen liegt wir wissen aber da der sohn gottes gekommen ist und uns einen sinn gegeben hat da wir den wahrhaftigen erkennen und wir sind in dem wahrhaftigen in seinem sohne jesus christus dieser ist der wahrhaftige gott und das ewige leben
7645671 was ihr von anfang an geh rt habt das bleibe in euch wenn in euch bleibt was ihr von anfang an geh rt habt so werdet auch ihr in dem sohne und in dem vater bleiben
7645672 bleibet in mir und ich bleibe in euch gleichwie das rebscho von sich selbst keine frucht bringen kann wenn es nicht am weinstock bleibt also auch ihr nicht wenn ihr nicht in mir bleibet ich bin der weinstock ihr seid die reben wer in mir bleibt und ich in ihm der bringt viel frucht denn getrennt von mir k nnt ihr nichts tun
7645673 darum sprach jesus zu ihnen wahrlich wahrlich ich sage euch wenn ihr nicht das fleisch des menschensohnes esset und sein blut trinket so habt ihr kein leben in euch wer mein fleisch i t und mein blut trinkt der hat ewiges leben und ich werde ihn auferwecken am letzten tage denn mein fleisch ist wahrhaftige speise und mein blut ist wahrhaftiger trank wer mein fleisch i t und mein blut trinkt der bleibt in mir und ich in ihm wie mich der lebendige vater gesandt hat und ich um des vaters willen lebe so wird auch der welcher mich i t um meinetwillen leben dies ist das brot das vom himmel herabgekommen ist nicht wie eure v ter das manna gegessen haben und gestorben sind wer dieses brot i t der wird leben in ewigkeit
7645674 der kelch des segens den wir segnen ist er nicht gemeinschaft mit dem blute christi das brot das wir brechen ist es nicht gemeinschaft mit dem leibe christi denn ein brot ist es so sind wir die vielen ein leib denn wir sind alle des einen brotes teilhaftig
7645675 und wer seine gebote h lt der bleibt in ihm und er in ihm und daran erkennen wir da er in uns bleibt an dem geiste den er uns gegeben hat
7645676 daran erkennen wir da wir in ihm bleiben und er in uns da er uns von seinem geiste gegeben hat
7645677 denn ihr sollt so gesinnt sein wie jesus christus auch war
7645678 und nicht mehr lebe ich sondern christus lebt in mir was ich aber jetzt im fleische lebe das lebe ich im glauben an den sohn gottes der mich geliebt und sich selbst f r mich hingegeben hat
7645679 darauf wird der k nig ihnen antworten amen ich sage euch was ihr f r einen meiner geringsten br der getan habt das habt ihr mir getan
7645680 darauf wird er ihnen antworten amen ich sage euch was ihr f r einen dieser geringsten nicht getan habt das habt ihr auch mir nicht getan
7645681 und als er zur erde fiel h rte er eine stimme die zu ihm sprach saul saul was verfolgst du mich er aber sagte wer bist du herr der aber sprach ich bin jesus den du verfolgst es wird dir schwer werden wider den stachel auszuschlagen
7645682 ich ermahne euch aber ihr br der kraft des namens unsres herrn jesus christus da ihr alle einerlei rede f hret und nicht spaltungen unter euch sein lasset sondern zusammenhaltet in derselben gesinnung und in derselben meinung
7645683 ich rede aber davon da unter euch der eine spricht ich halte zu paulus der andere ich zu apollos der dritte ich zu kephas der vierte ich zu christus ist christus zerteilt ist etwa paulus f r euch gekreuzigt worden oder seid ihr auf des paulus namen getauft
7645684 denn ihr seid noch fleischlich solange n mlich eifersucht und zank und zwietracht unter euch sind seid ihr da nicht fleischlich und wandelt nach menschenweise
7645685 ich ermahne euch meine br der auf die acht zu geben die im widerspruch zu der lehre die ihr gelernt habt spaltung und verwirrung verursachen haltet euch von ihnen fern
7645686 da aber jesus ihre gedanken merkte sprach er zu ihnen jedes reich das mit sich selbst uneins ist wird ver den und keine stadt kein haus das mit sich selbst uneins ist kann bestehen

7645695 i know my mom will never forgive me im never gonna forgive myself because theres that chance that i might not see caylee again and i dont want to think about that
7645696 she handed the kid off to somebody and has herself in a bind right now and she doesnt know what to do she could simply tell the cops i didnt want my daughter anymore and i gave her away
7645697 the child was not kidnapped the child is not dead

7645713 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7645714 given the short term inflexibility inherent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first budgetary deficit in over a decade
7645715 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7645716 an unknown that is thrown in there is that kellen lewis didnt practice last spring
7645717 his numbers are unbelievable but crafting a plan for an athletic quarterback isnt something weve never done before
7645718 well have to be smart with our contain players well have to tackle him when he gets a chance as hes very elusive and our offense has prepared us pretty well but the big thing that well have to adjust to is that kellen lewis is very very fast
7645719 all three of our quarterbacks that are redshirting anthony sheppard kawaun jakes and marcus vasquez have all been back there on the scout team and theres no question that theyve helped prepare for lewis
7645720 all three of those guys are going to be excellent football players for us and theres no doubt that were enjoying those 85 scholarships

7645776 im both humbled and honored by the recognition from sencer and hartwick college

7645818 we expect the number of downgrades to exceed upgrades for the rest of 2008 and probably in 2009 as business and financial challenges squeeze operating margins and weaken balance sheets
7645819 much of the operating pressure on the industry that we first observed in the fiscal year 2006 medians has continued into 2007 and we expect these pressures to continue in the next fiscal year especially given the materially weaker economy

7645877 first eosinophils are an extremely rare white blood cell less than 1 percent of all white blood cells that release a series of toxic proteins suspected in the cellular death surrounding parasite infections and the lung damage occurring in asthmatics
7645878 more importantly they generally are not thought of as a bodily defense against bacteria instead that job was suggested to fall to another white blood cell the neutrophil which comprises nearly 40 percent of all the white cells
7645879 the mitochondria are so complex that they need to carry with them their own genetic information to encode this structure surprisingly it is this dna that the eosinophils catapult out at the bacteria in rapid fire fashion a very odd use of genetic material its like throwing a phone at a criminal instead of calling the cops
7645880 crude but effective means with which to control the growth of bacteria and may be critical for both maintaining health and fighting disease
7645881 when we started out eosinophils were the odd cell out among the white cells they were thought of as a minor destructive cell population of limited use instead they now appear to be versatile cells with multiple functions in an ever increasing number of diseases

7645886 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
7645887 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
7645888 pdx is pleased to be the first aggregator of multi pharmacy electronic prescription records to enter into a strategic relationship with google this new agreement will allow our pharmacy customers both chain and independents the ability to integrate client prescription history into google health at the users request

7645894 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7645895 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7645896 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7645897 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7645898 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7645899 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7645900 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7645901 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying in birds and other smaller animals
7645902 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7645903 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7645904 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7645905 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7645906 our first idea was to study sleeping directions of humans e g when doing camping but there are too many constraints
7645907 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on s convenience also came with some downsides

7645910 bullying and particularly name calling can be degrading for adolescents posttraumatic stress is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a frightening event or ordeal in which physical harm occurred or was threatened and research clearly suggests that it can be caused by bullying it is important that peer victimization is taken seriously as symptoms such as insomnia anxiety and depression are common amongst victims and have a negative impact on psychological health
7645911 bullying at school what we know and what we can do
7645912 its always been the case that we expect rates of aggression and delinquency to increase for boys while girls were considered somewhat protected
7645913 in this study its clear that the differences between girls and boys are diminishing
7645914 girls entry into adolescence is generally thought of as a vulnerable time for depression and studies tend to focus on girls emotional experiences with sadness and depressed moods
7645915 whats interesting about this study is that we see an increase in a different negative emotional experience and thats anger
7645916 i counted on you to put out the trash and because you forgot well all have to put up with that stench in the garage for a week

7645918 vasten is een manier om het lichaam te disciplineren mensen die dieetpleisters gebruiken proberen hetzelfde te bereiken zegt een turkse moefti een islamitisch rechtsgeleerde
7645919 er stonden zelfs gouden en zilveren avondmaalsbekers waar dan wel op stond dat het gebruik van goud en zilver werd ontraden heel dubbel kerken leken in die tijd op pronkkamers van grachtenpanden en dat is ook logisch omdat de leden van de elite die in de kerk kwam hun objecten meenamen voor een goede representatie van hun kerk de vraag is waar al die objecten zijn gebleven
7645920 dat is waarschijnlijk het gevolg van een tweede beeldenstorm onder invloed van de meer orthodoxe gereformeerden die kritiek hadden op alle objecten besloten de hervormden om hun kerken ook meer leeg te ruimen
7645921 waarschijnlijk omdat we graag bevestigd willen zien wat we al denken is meulenkamps inschatting
7645922 het is jammer dat daardoor ten onrechte het beeld is ontstaan dat katholieken alles en protestanten niets hadden effect daarvan is dat vooral reformatorischen minder oog hebben voor kunst en cultuur want we hebben niks en we hoeven dus ook niets te hebben

7645933 the high powered party delegation has nothing to do with political inexperience but everything to do with the seriousness the npp attaches the campaign and more importantly the people in the north

7645960 they are making one of the biggest moves of their lives to date and we are ready to provide them with the knowledge and skills they will need to become successful students and global citizens

7645981 alarmed by reports of russias plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7645982 its been over four months since the country is being led by a resigning government which lacks legitimacy to address the problems
7645983 we launched a series of protests in april because the price of rice and other food products were too high but prices have doubled since then
7645984 and president rene preval and politicians in parliament are not doing anything to address the problems
7645985 poland would be considered defended as if its us soil

7645987 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states
7645988 no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice and no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once
7645989 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7645990 even the theoretical possibility of the orthodox churches acknowledging the apostolic succession
7645991 the representative of the moscow patriarchate expressed the hope that a similar event would not be repeated in the church of england and that the anglican communion as a whole would continue to support traditional standards of christian morality as expressed in the gospels and the writings of the church fathers
7645992 i am deeply concerned by todays appeal to president dmitry medvedev by russias federation council and duma the upper and lower houses of russias parliament to recognize the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as independent countries
7645993 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7645994 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7645995 because of that the democrat party has moved further and further to the left and has really adopted the homosexual lobbys wish list in its entirety
7645996 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7645997 the fact is i now have a reason a very good reason not to wait for the popes decision the annulment of my marriage must be declared immediately
7645998 for the fact is campeggio that the kings of europe have power but no morality i must act as their conscious they are my willful children and i their father leading them along the paths of righteousness
7645999 you are not beholden to rome only to god and me
7646000 if i had to choose between extreme happiness and extreme sorrow i would always choose sorrow for when you are happy you forget about spiritual things you forget about god but in your soul he is always with you
7646001 as long as i live i will always call myself the queen of england
7646002 the union between king henry and catherine of aragon is declared null and void and therefore the kings marriage to anne boleyn is declared both valid and lawful in the eyes of god
7646003 so keep your head its a pretty head in any case and i dont want to lose it either but store up your knowledge and your anger dont act impulsively its always a mistake but one day with others so disposed use them both and if you can bring her down and destroy her
7646004 ive been thinking about the past when i believed the king to be the most enlightened and promising prince in christendom i was sure his reign would be a golden age such high hopes
7646005 lady mary i have come to inform you of the judgements made recently by his grace the archbishop of canterbury his majestys marriage to your mother has been declared null and void your mother was never legally queen of england and must now accept the title of dowager princess just as you no longer have the right to call yourself princess but from now on must be known as lady mary at the same time his majestys recent marriage to queen anne has been declared legal and valid her coronation took place in london this past week
7646006 i know of no queen of england save my mother and i will accept no other queen except my mother
7646007 you and i are both young and by gods grace boys will follow
7646008 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7646009 i am sure his majesty will one day relent for i think i believe with all my heart that he still loves and cares for me
7646010 his majesty is aware that you favor the imperialist cause you say so openly in the council and have perhaps a great sympathy for the dowager princess
7646011 a shepard cannot stand idly by while the wolf enters the fold and threatens his flock i have decided to make fisher a cardinal you will send his hat to england lets see if the king is still prepared to prosecute and torture a prince of the church
7646012 it is natural for a man when his wife is big with child and not willing to lie with him to find some temporary consolation elsewhere and with kings it is properly expected sweetheart listen to me for the danger to you and to us is not that the king takes a mistress but that he takes the wrong one someone we cant control who would seek to control the king but if you suppose the king is sure to take a mistress then make sure she is your choice and not his
7646013 then fisher will have to wear it on his shoulders for by the time it gets here he wont have a head to wear it on
7646014 lady mary i am here in kindness i would welcome you back to court and reconcile you with your father if you would only recognize me as queen
7646015 i recognize no queen but my mother but if the kings mistress would intercede with the king on my behalf then i would be grateful
7646016 i cannot condone this new fangled vision of private belief and personal grace for me the church is the permanent and living sign of gods presence
7646017 clement was a terrible procrastinator although it was very wrong for some people to dig up his dead body and stab it in the street i can well understand their feelings he was never popular
7646018 some people will blame her for everything lady anne theyll blame her if it rains or if the rains fail they blame her for the barrenness of the queen or for the fact that i love her they blame her for the winds that destroy our crops and the storms that sink our ships its all the fault of the lady anne
7646019 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7646020 foundation of social order and community renewal universal to human experience
7646021 responsible source of new life it channels the powerful sexual impulse toward the creation and effective rearing of children
7646022 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7646023 you no play a the game you no make a the rules
7646024 what do you call a woman who uses the rhythm method mommy
7646025 the leading scholars who have tackled these topics are not christians and most of them are not political or social conservatives they are rather honest social scientists willing to follow the data wherever it may lead
7646026 although doubt will always remain about what causes a change in social custom the technology shock theory does fit the facts the new reproductive technology was adopted quickly and on a massive scale marital and fertility patterns changed with similar drama at about the same time
7646027 some of the most vital social indicators of all those regarding the condition and strength of the american family have so far refused to turn upward
7646028 with effective contraception controlled by women there are still more abortions than ever contraception causes abortion
7646029 the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now
7646030 the two strongest claims population controllers make for their long term historical contribution
7646031 that they raised asia out of poverty and helped keep our planet habitable
7646032 open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards
7646033 no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection
7646034 those of us who choose not to settle in hopes of finding a soul mate later are almost like teenagers who believe theyre invulnerable to dying in a drunk driving accident we lose sight of our mortality we forget that we too will age and become less alluring and even if some men do find us engaging and theyre ready to have a family theyll likely decide to marry someone younger with whom they can have their own biological children which is all the more reason to settle before settling is no longer an option
7646035 is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as porn worthy
7646036 sexual appetite has become like the relationship between agribusiness processed foods supersize portions and obesity if your appetite is stimulated and fed by poor quality material it takes more junk to fill you up people are not closer because of porn but further apart people are not more turned on in their daily lives but less so
7646037 the power and charge of sex are maintained when there is some sacredness to it when it is not on tap all the time
7646038 contraception has released males to a historically unprecedented degree from responsibility for their sexual aggression
7646039 in an ironic turn american evangelicals are rethinking birth control even as a majority of the nations roman catholics indicate a rejection of their churchs teaching
7646040 i cannot imagine any development in human history after the fall that has had a greater impact on human beings than the pill the entire horizon of the sexual act changes i think there can be no question that the pill gave incredible license to everything from adultery and affairs to premarital sex and within marriage to a separation of the sex act and procreation
7646041 i detect a huge shift students on our campus are intensely concerned not a week goes by that i do not get contacted by pastors about the issue there are active debates going on its one of the things that may serve to divide evangelicalism
7646042 about thirty students walked out of the vagina monologues in protest after the first scene and people familiar with the university are not surprised that it was the kids not the grownups who registered the strongest objections the students are probably the most religious part of the notre dame younger catholics tend to be among the more conservative ones
7646043 i wont tattle on my gay priest if youll give me absolution for contraception
7646044 the popes 1968 encyclical and the furor it created continue to polarize the american church
7646045 the only doctrine that had ever appeared as the teaching of the church on these things
7646046 if paul vi was right about so many of the consequences deriving from contraception it is because he was right about contraception itself
7646047 est acontecendo exatamente como na campanha de jaques wagner quando iniciamos o hor rio eleitoral com o mesmo percentual
7646048 meanwhile majesty your own treasury is much depleted isnt it not a thing to marvel at the richness of those who ought by right to be your subjects and the poverty and debt of the english crown
7646049 i told you i am her death and she is mine so long as they are both alive i cant be safe why doesnt catherine just die everyone tells me how ill she is why doesnt she die i have a thought the next time henry goes abroad i shall be left as regent i can just order their deaths
7646050 youre the queen of england why dont you act like it
7646051 i want to conceive again i want to conceive a son a son in the living image of his father but i cant as long as theyre alive i cant conceive a son
7646052 i will tell you a story once when i was a boy i went swimming and the tide carried me away from the shore into the deepest water it was then i prayed aloud to god and a friendly wave came and pushed me back to the shore so it is with the king of england he has been carried far from the shore but doesnt know it he does not ask for gods help he does not ask for our help he thinks he can swim alone but very soon he will realize he is not swimming but drowning
7646053 i did not bring you up to have opinions or to express them or to quarrel with those closest to the crown
7646054 i know how i got there and it wasnt all you it was not all you or norfolk or george or any man it was also me he fell in love with me he respected me and my opinions
7646055 there is good news all around catherine is dead and i am pregnant do you understand i am carrying the kings son we are on the edge of a golden world
7646056 i dont agree though that you have to sympathize with the main character of a show or movie there have been movies made about hitler and other horrible people where they are definitely the main character but still we are not expected to sympathize with them thats just my opinion anyway i know too much to ever feel sorry for henry
7646057 what unimaginably horrible thing is henry going to do this week
7646058 to the faithful people of england your holy father offers you the hand of condolence his tears of grief and his anger at the martyrdom of sir thomas more and cardinal fisher their murder has shocked the whole of christendom it was an unpardonable sin against god and our holy church in whose name these two great and noble men died we pray for those in england who must continue to live under tyranny and in fear for their lives and for their souls we pray the king ceases to listen to evil counsel and returns to obedience and the true faith before it is too late we pray to mary mother of god that england may be redeemed from heresy and all its evil ways and from the clutches of the heretics who even now are leading her towards destruction and damnation
7646059 plays are an ideal way of setting forth before peoples eyes the abomination and wickedness of the bishop of rome theyre also a means to demonstrate to people the obedience as subjects they owe by gods and mans laws to your majesty
7646060 fortunately we have a new weapon to promote our ideas its called the printing press my lord and it will change the world
7646061 you know i think our family never did anything better than to facilitate and encourage your own rise mr secretary and i trust you never forget that we did so
7646062 the harlot holds a secret she is deformed chapuys an extra finger nail on her left hand shes always at great pains to conceal as well her body its covered with moles which is sometimes called the devils teats as you know
7646063 but does it never concern you that the king has taken to himself an absolute power without any constraint to remake the law
7646064 we used to call it humanism wolsey more and me we were all humanists most people think ive changed but i havent at heart im still a humanist chapuys i promise you that im going to make such a reform in this kingdom that i should be remembered eternally throughout christendom
7646065 you must shut your eyes and endure like your betters have done before you
7646066 and dont you know i can drag you down as quickly as i have raised you
7646067 your majesty we had a great success throughout the whole country in the swearing of allegiance to your majesty as head of the church also in favor of your marriage to queen anne but we cannot persuade either fisher or thomas more to swear the oath however they may swear to part of it sir thomas has already told us he has no argument with the act of succession
7646068 there can be no compromise for if we allow them of all men to swear to what they like and nothing else then they will set a precedent for others to follow in this matter your grace it is all or nothing
7646069 i want you to understand please i do not willingly seek martyrdom i will do everything i can to accommodate the king and his desires you must remember that he once made me a promise that he would never force me to do anything against my conscience to look first unto god and only after unto him
7646070 i truly believe that man to be an emissary of satan
7646071 poor fisher he was a lion in my defense now he will die alone and ashamed in a prison cell
7646072 you and i campeggio have done well to avoid the craft of women celibacy is an immense relief
7646073 on the other hand in the days of the founders of our church it was considered a privilege to be martyred like saint peter and the other apostles our church was founded upon the blood of these martyrs so perhaps it is a pity that you and i campeggio unlike cardinal fisher no longer have the opportunity to die for christ
7646074 you and your fine honest young man can rot in hell as far as im concerned
7646075 this is all i know of mary that she is my death and i am hers
7646076 good people i ask you to love the king and obey him for he is good by nature even if he is not right in his religious policies that i am condemned to die for wishing to uphold the honor of god and the holy see now good christian people i ask for your prayers i am only flesh and fear death as much as any man its true that i long since made up my mind to die if need be for christ and his church now that the moment is at hand i need your help
7646077 i ask you to bear witness with me that i shall now suffer death in and for the faith of the holy catholic church i beg you earnestly to pray for the king tell him i died his good servant but gods first
7646078 you know perfectly well what the king desires and what he will have
7646079 heres to the queen who doesnt give a fig gawd bless her
7646080 alright so you were a f king virgin thats not the point
7646081 if all ambassadors were women i would be serving my country day and night
7646082 i care nothing for katherine i would rather see her hanged than acknowledge her as my mistress
7646083 i would only be unhappy is you stopped loving me
7646084 he may threaten to break with rome but i dont think he will ever do so
7646085 when satan was thrown from heaven was he ever invited back
7646086 god has given me gout its a great trial if your grace had some water perhaps laced with a bit of wine
7646087 all the world now agrees that our marriage was unjust
7646088 god never called me to a nunnery i am the kings true and legitimate wife
7646089 sir i beseech you for all the love that has been between us let me have justice amp right give me some pity amp compassion for i am a poor woman amp a stranger born out of your dominion i have no friend here amp little counsel i plea to you as head of justice in this realm i call god and all the world to witness that i have been to you a true humble and obedient wife ever compliant to your will amp pleasure i have loved all those whom you have loved for your sake whether or not i had cause whether they be friends or enemies by me you have had many children although it has pleased god to call them from this world but when you had me at first i take god as my judge i was a true maid without touch of men and whether or not it be true i put it to your conscience

7646099 we are conscious that there are certain church buildings where floodlighting is part of security and people use it as a walkway that would be taken into account when deciding whether or not to cut back on floodlighting
7646100 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a re orientation the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with all that lives
7646101 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others i am delighted that the church of england now has this helpful guide which will prove invaluable for those wanting to plan their own services and for all those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation

7646120 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time
7646121 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day
7646122 the other view of what a national cto should do be a traditional cto and get more of our government to use technology to be more efficient and transparent

7646125 i held onto it medal for three days just to make sure it is not a dream that it was real

7646128 for a russian athlete nothing is bigger and more important than the olympic gold medal

7646132 my job as president is to make sure we are tightening the screws on iran diplomatically to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a different calculation
7646133 and weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is against the wall
7646134 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
7646135 their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7646136 they recognize there are no good military options but they also recognize that from their perspective it is unacceptable to allow iran to have a nuclear weapon
7646137 the problem is that for most of the bush administration instead of trying to engage directly with iran there was a lot of saber rattling
7646138 tell them thank you and they are in my prayers

7646147 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7646148 the recent upward pressure on retail mortgage rates due to pressures on gse borrowing rates and further weakening in the employment market threatens to delay the expected housing market recovery
7646149 the goal is to supply people with everything they might need to know to make the smartest decisions

7646377 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7646378 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7646379 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7646396 the current view of the dalai lamas is that each was
7646397 the tibetan exile government is run by three families one of which is mine i e the dalai lamas or the yabshi family
7646398 opening of the political eye tibets long search for democracy
7646399 thomas merton the catholic divine once observed that nowhere in the world was a leader so loved by his people as the dalai lama it should be the task of government officials to strengthen this bond of affection and loyalty and direct it towards the achievement of our common goal not pervert it to blackmailing the people into silence the chinese are doing their best to turn us into a nation of sheep it is heartbreaking that the tibetan government should be attempting to hasten the process
7646400 opening of the political eye tibets long search for democracy
7646401 the dalai lama used the occasion of his 64th birthday on tuesday to announce he will not be reincarnated in tibet but in a free country outside chinese control
7646402 if i die and the tibetan people want another dalai lama that person will appear in the refugee community outside of tibet
7646403 after i die this is not my responsibility let someone else worry about it
7646404 as dalai lama woos beijing tibetans pray for his return
7646405 beyond the dalai lama his successor could be the solution
7646406 i also believe that the tibetan people should be able to decide their future their form of government and their social system he wrote adding that no tibetan is interested in restoring outdated political and social
7646407 to struggle for the total independence of tibet even at the cost of ones life
7646408 it is possible to think of a time when we will make friends with the chinese but with these dorje shugden people never
7646409 it has been twenty years since i first mentioned the dorje shugden public restriction ngas dam
7646410 it may have been about ten years ago while giving a lam rim teaching at drepung i once gave my reasons for issuing the ban
7646411 in this way came the reasons on account of which i have issued the ban tibetan dam bsgrags in recent times in banning this reliance on shugden many came forward and declared that henceforth they will abide by my injunctions
7646412 specifically after issuing an emphatic ban at his the dalai lama spring teachings of 1996 most of the tibetans living in exile and within tibet who are gifted with intelligence and patriotism have respectfully complied and appreciatively mended their faith accordingly
7646413 i did not encourage anyone to practice dorje shugden nor did i ban its worship
7646414 if tibetans in general and worshipers of dholgyal dorje shugden in particular do not immediately stop worshiping him an intolerable time will be upon us for this reason we cannot take refuge in the concept of freedom of religion
7646415 it will be the last resort if we have to knock on their your doors it would be good if they you can heed this without us having to resort to this last step
7646416 if you wish the speedy death of the dalai lama then i have no objection to your continuing to rely on dholgyal dorje shugden
7646417 none of the material amnesty international has received contain evidence of abuses which fall within the violations of fundamental human rights including torture the death penalty extra judicial execution arbitrary detention or imprisonment or unfair trials
7646418 i have come to be counted among the line of the fifth dalai lama i feel a definite karmic connection with my predecessor it is my mandate to complete what was in practice during the fifth dalai lama and my predecessor this is my responsibility
7646419 this much i can say through previous lives i do believe there is some special connection between my being and the tibetan nation my spiritual work and the freedom of tibet are inextricably linked and i feel with some confidence some connection with previous dalai lamas particularly the fifth and thirteenth dalai lamas
7646420 conflict between the fifth dalai lama and tulku dragpa gyaltsen
7646421 the shuk den affair history and nature of a quarrel
7646422 again in the fifteenth year of the term regent sonam chophel also known as sonam rabten in the fire monkey year of the 11th sexagenary cycle in 1656 the reincarnate lama of drepung zimkhang ghongma known as tulku dragpa gyaltsen was unjustly assassinated out of jealousy by stuffing a silk scarf into his throat immediately thereafter the deceased transformed into a malevolent force known as dhol gyalpo creating great havoc upon those of ganden potang the estate of the dalai lamas at drepung monastery of which sonam chophel the regent believed to be responsible for tulku dragpa gyaltsens death was the main administrator during the fifth dalai lamas time as well as the name for the government founded by him when this continued time and again following order of the dalai lama the sakya dagchen ruling head of the sakya tradition of tibetan buddhism sonam rinchen brought dhol gyalpo under covenant becoming what is known as dorje shugden who is nowadays propitiated as protector deity by most of the patrons and masters on the gelug side
7646423 due to much devotion to dge lugs he assumed the role of the protector of the religion and the savior of the dge lugs pa as per popular belief i think this is true
7646424 one of those frequent and unrewarding campaigns the dge lugs pa regime thought necessary to undertake against bhutan as the bastion of the older sects
7646425 the dalai lama forbade any further reincarnation of that line zhwa dmar pa of the karma kagyu tradition of tibetan buddhism now believed to incarnate in situ rinpoche fn 6 p 359 and also confiscated the property including the monastery of yangs pa can which was conveyed to the dge lugs pa monastery of kun bde gling
7646426 the rebirth of the first dalai lama as the son of grub chen kun dga rgyal mtshan resulted in the end of a hereditary line of shangs pa bka brguyd pa lamas this process continued until recent times the 6th dalai lama brought the dge lugs pa considerable leverage with his branch of the gnyos the descendants of padma gling pa the chief lamas of the mtsho sna area
7646427 the dalai lama sees in his vision that a large human head with a macabre face rises in front of the offerings on the altar it opens its mouth wide and numerous human heads fall into it like grains into a bag the dalai lama remarks that this vision is a sign of success concerning the objective of the rite which is the victory of gushri khan and his forces over the king of tsang in 1642
7646428 he perceives that he has in fact become guru drag dmar a wrathful aspect of padmasambhava p 54 and is so big that his head reaches the heavens due to the accomplishment of his meditation he makes the remark that he has gained some confidence in performing a violent rite
7646429 se ra and bras spungs gling were destroyed in the seventh hor month
7646430 the army of gtsang destroyed the monasteries of se ra and bras spung and murdered many a thousand
7646431 although it is not stated in the biography of the fifth dalai lama according to common tradition it is believed that dakpa gyaltsen was killed by stuffing his mouth with scarves
7646432 it is my view that tulku dakgpa gyaltsens instinctive behaviour and ways of thinking were good i have looked at his collected works which also contain his secret biography he seems to have been good in his studies and to have a gentle subdued mind in his biography there are a few guru yoga texts one of which has buddha shakyamuni in the center and around him guru rinpoche padmasambhava 9th century surrounded by the guru lineage of the nyingma order sachen kunga nyingpo 1092 1158 surrounded by the guru lineage of the sakya order marpa 1012 1097 mila 1052 1135 and dwagpo 1079 1161 surrounded by the guru lineage of kagyud order je rinpoche tsong khapa 1375 419 and his two spiritual sons surrounded by the gurus of gelug order teachings of past sakya gelug kagyud and nyingma masters are summarized and it is explained that one should pay homage and recite eulogies through recollecting their qualities at the conclusion he explains that a boundless crime based on contemporary sectarianism produces causes to be thrown into bad realms and that he had written this guru yoga deliberately to avoid such negative results having seen that i thought it was good usually gyalchen dorje shugden is considered a biased deity since there was this account in the collected works of dakpa gyaltsen i thought it was good
7646433 from this time 1634 through the iron serpent year 1641 the incarnated lama of the gzims khang gong next to me in rank continued to attend the smon lam
7646434 the dissemination of the belief in the dalai lama as a manifestation of the bodhisattva avalokiteshvara
7646435 at lhasa which was enhanced by measures to demonstrate the continuity of the new regime with the religious rule of the great kings of the seventh to ninth centuries court ceremonial and pageantry the building of the magnificent palace on the potala hill underlined that theme and the cult of the dalai lama as the embodiment of phags pa spyan ras gzigs avalokitesvara was perhaps developed at this time
7646436 for the dalai lama to become the supreme religious authority in all tibet it was imperative that only a single incarnate lama in the person of the dalai lama preside over bras spungs monastery from his headquarters at the dga ldan palace
7646437 in the years between 1642 and 1653 the dalai lama took various actions presenting himself to the populace as a manifestation of avalokiteshvara since avalokiteshvara was believed already before the establishment of the dge lugs pa school to be the bodhisattva charged with converting tibet it is beyond doubt that the faith engendered in the minds of both the nobility and the general populace as a result of the dalai lamas actions served to gradually enhance the power of the dalai lama and reais him to a position on a different level from that of the regent and gusri khan and his descendants ever since then right up until the present day the dalai lama has continued to exert enormous influence over the people of tibet as a manifestation of avalokiteshvara
7646438 on the dissemination of the belief in the dalai lama as a manifestation of the bodhisattva avalokitesvara
7646439 this consolidation of religious and secular power in a single figure was an important moment in tibetan history a consolidation that received strong ideological support through the promotion of the cult of avalokitesvara
7646440 the lineage of the dalai lamas which can be traced back to the tibetan king choegyal trisong deutsan and even further to a relationship with gyalpo kunchog bang
7646441 in tibets religious development the eleventh century was a formative period for subsequent religious movements and especially for the legitimation of the territory of larger tibet three provinces by the gelugpas in the seventeenth century
7646442 srong btsan sgam po khri srong lde btsan and ral pa can who were acclaimed as manifestations of avalokitesvara manjushri and vajrapani respectively srong btsan sgam po the most fearful warrior of all the kings was not the manifestation of the gentle benevolent avalokitesvara the lord of compassion
7646443 above all warriors who lead the army in person and engaged in battle
7646444 and for twenty seven generations of kings politics was protected by the drung legendary narratives deu symbolic language of signs like geomancy divination etc and b n shamanic rituals and knowledge
7646445 he was born in a rnying ma pa family and is widely believed in tibet to have been for all his life a secret supporter of the unreformed sects
7646446 with these fictitious religious mythological genealogies the origin of their ancestors was not only to be found in the tibetan ancient history but also anchored in the indian buddhist tradition in order to let their ancestry appear as noble as possible
7646447 the shuk den affair history and nature of a quarrel
7646448 the bka brgyud pa sect had already tried to make out the child as a reincarnation of one of their own lamas before he was recognized as that of the fourth dalai lama but this was not all there was also another more serious candidate for the reincarnation of the fourth dalai lama among the dge lugs pas themselves this was grags pa rgyal mtshan 1619 54 who was presented as a possible reincarnation before being finally recongized as the reincarnation of pan chen bsod nams grags pa 1478 1554 the teacher of the third dalai lama
7646449 from the very outset the presence of this incarnate lama tulku dragpa gyaltsen weighed heavily on the fifth dalai lama
7646450 since there exist no records of events in tibet around 1642 other than the fifth dalai lamas autobiography
7646451 so in the past some ganden throneholders relied upon dholgyal and inauspicious things occurred thus the great throneholder vajradhara destroyed the shrine referring to the above incident about the local evil monk spirit and expelled him from the monastery the account was told
7646452 by this you mean to say he did not compose this prayer or you did not see it there are many other works composed by the fifth dalai lama that are not in his collected works for example
7646453 remembering the promise tulku dragpa gyaltsen had made some two hundred years and several life times earlier when he was je tsong khapas disciple duldzin dragpa gyaltsen he went to pehar chok
7646454 a system of tantric practices first conceived and taught be the great je rinpoche tsongkapa 1357 1419 also known more fully as the ganden oral tradition of mahamudra or concisely as the gelukpa mahamudra
7646455 since the time of the victorious gedun gyatso the second dalai lama nechung has been one of the two state protectors referred to as the red and black protectors who have had special connection with tibets ganden potang government
7646456 he the thirteenth dalai lama did not ban gyalchens i e dorje shugden performance from lhasa trode khangsar
7646457 phabongka was famous for his view that lamas should not become involved in politics
7646458 in consideration for the well being of the dalai lama the common cause of tibet and the edification of the gelugpa tradition since it is the responsibility of the government to see to it that these addresses of his holiness are followed to the letter we have taken these steps to be clean followers of lama tsong khapa and to facilitate clear understanding of right and wrong as well as proper appreciation of present and long term benefit the standing committee of the peoples deputies the private office of the dalai lama the information and international relations department have distributed tapes and transcriptions of his holiness speeches in successive support the cabinet received signed declarations from monasteries organizations and private individuals convinced of the detrimental effects both for the public and private individuals through these persuasions stating their decision to stop worshiping dholgyal dorje shugden henceforth we recognize this gesture of self responsibility toward our common cause
7646459 if worshiping dholgyal poses a threat to our cause and the well being of his holiness there is no benefit in talking about democracy or freedom of religion
7646460 his holiness is the incomparable secular and religious head of this government in virtue of his religious and political office it is his responsibility and right to guide us and restrain harmful factors toward tibetan governance how is this against democracy to make such a complaint is similar to leveling charges of denial of religious freedom by a black magician who is restrained from practicing his art on a subject whether this restraint constitutes infringement of religious freedom is self evident to any nation or person
7646461 in summary no tibetan monastic establishment under this exile government is permitted to worship dholgyal given this condition anyone who continues to worship dholgyal indifferent to our cause and threatening the well being of his holiness fervent about freedom of religion saying we will never change our faith in dholgyal is free of course to howl this way this freedom is also given by his holiness however the perception toward such a person organization will be decided by the majority of the tibetan populace therefore at this juncture irrespective of time or place including tibetans abroad everyone should make common cause of this issue
7646462 heads of our religious traditions abbots and reincarnate lamas geshes representative officers of the government and people in areas of responsibility you are requested to bear the recent addresses of his holiness about dholgyal in mind and just as the body is under the head bring into the fold everyone under your jurisdiction furthermore since this is liable to be exploited by others give clear explanations to the public on the part of the general tibetan populace without changing sides and with patriotism in your heart you are urged to come out and express your convictions and use your talent abilities and strength as contribution to your exile government
7646463 this is not my issue it is the issue of tibetan religion and politics
7646464 the shuk den affair history and nature of a quarrel
7646465 the fundamental characteristic of tibet as a nation has been peace compassion non violence and spirituality
7646466 his upholding of our highest ideas of love compassion and forgiveness have made him our very soul
7646467 returned to shambala wrote a long exposition of it and propagated kalachakra buddhism as the state religion
7646468 the kalachakra the most revered of all tibetan buddhist rituals is open to persons of all spiritual traditions and beliefs
7646469 was standing in front of his residence with his arms folded i pulled up in my van with the lama in the passenger seat on the side facing norbu he was fuming and glaring at us i said hello rinpoche he said leave i said what he said go away i spun my wheels and drove out for the last time
7646470 devil worshiper we will kill you you are on the list
7646471 draws on the ancient primordial wisdom of pre industrial societies of tibet india china japan and korea
7646472 driven by their deeply ingrained sense of the intrinsic superiority of the west and the historic inevitability of its form of modernity
7646473 a high lama in government service such as the dalai lama or the panchen lama
7646474 the kalachakra or wheel of time tantra is especially connected with the tibetan calendar and sense of history or destiny as it contains the famous prophecy of shambhala the emblem was regarded as a powerful talisman signifying that the ganden palace government based in the potala was authorized to maintain tibets connection with the kalachakra eschatology
7646475 independence has been the mantra to every tibetan tibets proposed future constitution promulgated in 1965 now rendered obsolete clearly mentioned the need for tibetans to strive for independence this has been diluted to accommodate the chinese offer to negotiate anything less than independence the 11th assembly of the tibetan peoples deputies adopted this in the present charter of tibetans in exile
7646476 the dalai lamas public persona was built up one grain at a time like the celebrated mandala over a period of nearly forty years by the time i met him back in 1970 he was already highly respected as a great buddhist teacher and an untiring advocate of non violence since then like gandhi and mother teresa he came to epitomize the very essence of humanity itself
7646477 on the dalai lamas first trip to new york in 1979 he went to see the statue of liberty not even recognized by passers by he gave talks to a total of 1 000 people without security guards police escorts or trailing photographers today his fame and his following will draw a more traditional reaction to celebrity his every move has been mapped out by the state department city police officers are blocking off and stationing guards along his itinerary photographers television camera operators and reporters from around the world will be following him and an estimated 40 000 people are expected at the four major talks
7646478 with 13th visit dalai lama has gone from obscurity to celebrity
7646479 the institution of dalai lama has become the guardian of tibetan buddhism
7646480 although the last few years have been more or less a failure it does not mean that we have no hope
7646481 his holiness knows best what is needed in the long run
7646482 to all himalayan buddhists who fear the extinction of their culture more than death
7646483 historically buddhism grew and expanded its reach through the support of enlightened or shrewd emperors and kings these realms while feudal in organization were not usually intolerant theocracies rulers among them the early kings of tibet and nepal saw in buddhism not a philosophy with which to garb authority or cloak conquest but a force for civilizing and elevating their courts and the people they ruled with the demise or dilution of the old kingdoms tibetans ladakhis and bhutanese in recent decades have consciously made buddhism the hall mark of their nationality and sometimes a banner for militancy or even violence that in some few places at certain overheated moments approaches religious fundamentalism
7646484 the interrelationship among the tibetan gods are too complicated to be comprehended by a common man but it is in fact the key element influencing all facets of tibetan life
7646485 i seek his nechung opinion in the same way as i seek the opinion of my cabinet and just as i seek the opinion of my conscience i consider the gods to be my upper house the kashag constitutes my lower house like other leaders i consult both before making a decision on affairs of state
7646486 religious fundamentalism which began to supersede any idea of learning from the west
7646487 opening of the political eye tibets long search for democracy
7646488 in our work and in our cause we are trying to be very responsible but the world should also be responsible toward a group of people that is trying to be an example for the world
7646489 whoever fights against the shugden spirit defends religious freedom i compare this definitely to the nazis in germany whoever fights them defends human rights since the freedom of nazis is not freedom
7646490 worshiping of dorjee shugden deity has for long had an adverse effect on the overall interest of the tibetan cause for independence and seen to be harmful to the personal safety of the dalai lama by reducing his life span
7646491 in the long run i feel tibet which is a small greater tibet was as big as europe landlocked country might get some benefits by merging with a big nation
7646492 when we return to tibet i will not head the state
7646493 that tibetans must have independence if only for survival as a people
7646494 it must be remembered that it was the hope of independence that kept our exile society strong and united in the difficult early years many of the problems our society now faces with religious and political quarrels decline in school educational standards the lamentably disgraceful commercialization of our religion cynicism in the administration and loss of self respect and integrity among the ordinary people have definite roots in the gradual relinquishing of the freedom struggle by the tibetan establishment during the last two decades
7646495 rangzen charter appeal to my fellow tibetans and freedom loving people everywhere
7646496 i think this cannot be explained in simple terms it is more religious and spiritual debate i suppose it is the influence of dorje shugden and the action that lead to it from childhood i never heard anything good about dorje shugden other than he is worshiped for material rewards it is also to do with trust between the teacher and student or leader and his followers dorje shugden apparently came back to challenge the works of the dalai lama so goes the story i am sorry for not being able to shed more light onto this tseten
7646497 freedom in tibetan language is called rangwang it is something more than mere translation of the english word freedom or independence it is an ancient classical word which meant precisely sovereignty self control or self rule it refers more to self discipline rather than uncontrolled anarchy
7646498 i sincerely believe that my middle way approach will contribute to stability and unity of the prc this basic approach was conceived in the early seventies even when there was no immediate possibility of a dialogue with the chinese leadership as china was then in the midst of the cultural revolution i adopted this approach because i believed that this was to our long term mutual interest
7646499 as long as the dalai lama is alive we have hope
7646500 my horoscope says i will live until i am more than one hundred twenty my dreams suggest more than one hundred i myself believe that i will live into my nineties as i get older i find my physical health getting better i think because of tibetan medicine holistic medicine
7646501 it is strange this devotion to his holiness it has nothing to do with the guru devotion of the dharma it is something else something totally different it is more like a political feeling because of his holiness receiving international recognition the nobel peace prize and so on we see him as a great tibetan hero a great leader religious devotion is now all mixed up with this nationalistic and political feeling for someone like our king this mixture finally produces something very strange in the mind a dedication to someone for whom one is ready to criticize and give up everything else including the buddha
7646502 the widely respected spiritual leader the symbol of tibetan identity over the last four decades
7646503 it doesnt matter if the dalai lama says that there is no discrimination in his policy towards the cause of tibet when in fact this is the actual policy or thought at the core of his heart
7646504 for the tibetan peoples fight for survival closed ranks geschlossenheit and unity are very important
7646505 his holiness is trying to promote secular beliefs in our communities so that all live in harmony at this point when there are certain sections which advocate sectarian attitudes it does not help the common cause of tibet
7646506 our governments policies are based on religious mind or on the basic principle of religion and that does not mean it is buddhism or hinduism or any ism we say the eternal dharma the eternal dharma subscribes to truth non violence and equality and this has been the essence of eternal dharma dharma and polity become one and the religious mind is governing the provisions of our polity
7646507 non sectarian among the tibetan buddhist traditions sakya nyingma kagyu gelug means not only to respect but to practice them simultaneously
7646508 the unity among the four tibetan traditions you know nyingma kagyu gelug sakya
7646509 which of your many accomplishments are you most proud or most pleased with
7646510 people and deities are exactly the same there are official deities and unofficial ones only the deities recognized by the government are allowed to be revered to revere unofficial deities is against the law
7646511 to some people this is a lot of noise laughs especially like shugden
7646512 this spirit is an obstacle to this promotion of non sectarianism
7646513 the worship of this spirit means you should not touch nyingma tradition
7646514 above all the shugdens are angry that the dalai lama is promoting dialogue between the yellow hats and another major branch of tibetan buddhism nyingma or the red hats the shugdens consider it a sin even to talk to red hats or to touch nyingma religious works
7646515 once you touch nyingma tradition even one text of nyingma in your house your room this spirit will destroy you
7646516 a lineage is an unbroken transmission of living wisdom it is living because mastery of the lineages practices and techniques which give rise to that wisdom is perfectly maintained generation after generation this mastery is handed down through the ages via a succession of highly accomplished persons each able to ensure that the integrity of what he or she has received will be carefully passed on to the most gifted disciples who in turn will do the same
7646517 how would the situation seem to others when a person whom the dalai lama had singled out from among equals and to whom he had given responsibility write such a book
7646518 ah they belong to the same faction but they vary only in their degree of frankness the dalai lamas guru speaks like this and a man to whom the dalai lama has given special attention speaks in the same way it doesnt matter if the dalai lama says that there is no discrimination in his policy towards the cause of tibet when in fact this is the actual policy or thought at the core of his heart
7646519 milosevic like former chilean dictator augusto pinochet who is languishing under house arrest in britain while he fights extradition to spain on torture charges should be forgiven for alleged crimes against humanity in kosovo he the dalai lama said
7646520 the fifth dalai lama wrote in his biography that he destroyed dorje shugden in spite of this the worship of dorje shugden became very popular especially among the gelugpa aristocracy
7646521 auch im buddhismus gibt es gute und b se kr fte
7646522 i admit that at the time marxism and the idea of socialism were fascinating i also confess that i continue to share many of marxs ideas on the economy i believe that the marxist economic theory has a very important moral content the only thing that matters in capitalism is to make money there is no concern whatsoever as to how it should be spent
7646523 opening of the political eye tibets long search for democracy
7646524 the dalai lamas statement on the compatibility between buddhism and marxism is meant for the consumption of a wider chinese audience
7646525 tibet needed reforms without communism several reforms could not have been implemented the bad thing was only that the communists exaggerated as a result so much unnecessary damage occurred but in principle i support marxist economic theory it is wonderful to limit the ruling class to fight exploitation provided it does not turn into exploitation by the state when i was in china in 1954 i expressed the wish to join the communist party
7646526 at that time the chinese leaders told me it was not the right time to join the communist party but they offered to let me participate in party conventions
7646527 the root cause of the tibetan problem is not the difference in ideology social system or issues resulting from clashes between tradition and modernity it lies in tibets long separate history its distinct and ancient culture and its unique identity
7646528 a just and fair solution to the issue of tibet will enable me to give full assurance that i will use my moral authority to persuade the tibetans not to seek separation
7646529 i was a monk for about four years and then i quit then for about ten years i had this theory that monasticism was ok in the old days i considered that being a monk was old fashioned and that in the new age we have universities and schools this was my theory until the mid 70s i suddenly collided in the late 70s with monasticism as an essentially important institution that has great power and i came to respect it
7646530 wisdom and compassion so successful came from what is now called the ganden renaissance
7646531 the main characteristic is the full maturity of distinctively tibetan style of painting and sculpture 15th century all the many important influences received from the artistic traditions of bengal bihar nepal kashmir khotan and china became well integrated within the repertoire of the great tibetan painting schools of the early 15th century
7646532 not the dalai lama is responsible for the lack of reform of his religion according to david jackson who holds a chair of tibetan studies at the university of hamburg it is the people surrounding him tibetan families of the old aristocracy or perhaps members of his own family
7646533 the meaning of fame has shifted with celebrities pretending to be just like you and me yes its an illusion but its a powerful one
7646534 dorje shugden should only be practiced by highly realized yogis and in secret otherwise if they do it like today then there is more harm than benefit and the result will be more faults than virtue
7646535 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7646536 la poeta crea la unidad m s bien vence los espacios con la palabra las palabras vivas en la mesa de disecci n con el cuerpo de la mujer siempre en el milagro del estado arm nico del fest n de la comuni n de los contrarios desnuda es una met fora en la ceremonia del poetizar
7646537 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7646538 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7646539 from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7646540 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7646541 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7646542 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7646543 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7646544 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7646545 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7646546 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7646547 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7646548 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7646549 when it comes time for election ill let someone else take it over ive got plenty on my plate

7646559 just as i support my life neither by robbery nor alms but by my own effort so i do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others but earn it by my own achievement just as i do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life so i do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my desires so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another with a cannibals lust men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them

7646564 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7646565 this is an example of us clarifying what the governments intent is with regards to its agenda and what the governments agenda is not
7646566 that clarity i think is helpful for canadians especially as we go into a period where they might be forced to make a choice

7646569 the promise of development and the advancement of universal human values can be undermined by war and conflict

7646572 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
7646573 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice

7646580 we believe the value of cemex venezuela is somewhere around us 1bn according to the local government the company was asking for us 1 3bn and was offered us 400mn

7646604 frankly the house is too big for me but i just fell in love with that area im having the house renovated right now im staying at the omni
7646605 yes but i cant wait to get moved into the house
7646606 no problem actually i get that a lot but so many of the women i meet are just looking to strike it rich so i have to be careful
7646607 but what made you think i was divorced couldnt i have been like you still waiting for mr right
7646608 are you kidding me look at you youre just too beautiful to have made it this long without some guy winning you over
7646609 no he had his own money that wasnt the problem he just turned out to be a major jerk
7646610 well yes i suppose i was lucky in that sense but i was miserable for seven years so i dont feel very lucky
7646611 why did you stay in a bad marriage for so long
7646612 because of my mother i still remember her exact words i forbid you to marry him then at the wedding reception she pulled me aside and told me i would be divorced within a year i had to prove her wrong
7646613 well sure i can understand that but why did you stick it out for all those years wouldnt one year have proved her wrong
7646614 yes it would have if she hadnt kept telling me i was being stupid for not divorcing him
7646615 forgive me for saying so but you seem to be rather stubborn
7646616 so why did you finally give in and get the divorce
7646617 oh im sorry did you two ever settle your differences
7646618 not really but we did love each other arguing was just something we liked to do i never fully realized it until her death but those were our most fun times together
7646619 its okay it really does feel like a date lets get out of here
7646620 well we could go to my never mind that sounds like im trying to get you into bed
7646621 what your hotel room no i didnt think that at all i can see what kind of man you are you wouldnt try to take advantage of me but lets go to my house ive got a huge fireplace we can relax on the couch and talk and have a glass of wine
7646622 charles im ready to go home and i have a guest thanks
7646623 charles will be here with the limo by the time we walk out front
7646624 none of that remember youre saving yourself for miss right
7646625 and i hope to spend a lot of time with you
7646626 but i really think we could have something very special together
7646627 this would be a lovely addition to your collection mrs goldalore
7646628 if you ask me to marry you in a couple of weeks and i say yes this can be my engagement ring but i really want it now
7646629 i dont like to walk out of here wearing a brand new piece of expensive jewelry its just asking to get mugged ill wear it to dinner
7646630 no i was here this morning with mary and last night
7646631 okay youre going to have to leave now or im going to call the police
7646632 my name is janice you might remember me as a brunette
7646633 you really dont remember me it was about a year ago in little rock i borrowed some jewelry and a dress from my employer and went to a nighclub when youre a maid its hard to get dates with well to do men i figured if a man thought i was wealthy he would give me a chance then he could get to know the real me
7646634 and you did give me a chance but when you took me home that night you drugged me and stole my borrowed jewelry the next morning a realtor woke me up he was showing the house to potential buyers and it wasnt even your house
7646635 gee then thats quite a coincidence since his name was also kyle pickerpan
7646636 so mr pickerpan shall we call the police to discuss the ring or would you just like to call it even
7646637 you women are crazy i dont know who this man is that youre talking about or why hes using my name but im gonna find out
7646638 yes we did thanks for all your help and it was so nice of your friend sylvia to go with me last night i dont think i could have pulled it off without her help
7646639 what about that dolly woman you think she was kyles partner
7646640 yes i really believe she was just waiting at the bar looking for prospects she might have already talked to several women before we came in maybe they were married or not rich enough who knows
7646641 wearing tons of jewelry but i would have been too nervous without sylvia dolly would have seen right through me im not much of an actress
7646642 but i really thought i was in trouble when i saw your friend jennifer sitting in the next booth
7646643 yeah im surprised she didnt say something but i guess she was too busy listening she called me this morning to tell me what shed heard of course she had already spread the story about my maid going around pretending to be me now she feels pretty foolish
7646644 well im just glad you spotted kyle yesterday morning when you were in town im surprised you recognized him you were only with him that one night and that was a year ago
7646645 thanks for writing me the check are you sure george will take the ring back
7646646 oh yes its no problem weve done business for years
7646647 he called after you two left i think he enjoyed being in on it
7646648 well okay then ive got my car packed so ill head out now
7646649 please be careful and let me know how youre doing
7646650 maybe your moms health will take a turn for the better i know its going to be tough caring for her around the clock
7646651 yes but what else can i do shes my mother
7646652 i know you think we should stay off the main highway kyle but this is kind of ridiculous
7646653 theres not even any moonlight if the car dies and the battery goes dead we wont even be able to see our own hands in front of our faces
7646654 we just need to get as far away from mary goldalore as possible right now
7646655 quit worrying theres no way mary has figured out that i replaced all her jewels with fakes it would take a jeweler to tell the difference she wont know for months or maybe even years
7646656 maybe a taillight went out i dont know but well be fine if we just stay cool put the bag of jewelry on the floorboard dolly under your feet
7646657 i need you to get out and step to the rear of the car all three of you
7646658 im going to count to three before i start shooting
7646659 are you absolutely sure you want to move to miami i hear its a lot more humid down there than it is here in atlanta
7646660 well it is a great opportunity ive always wanted to run a bar on the beach and my brothers got the deal all set up
7646661 im sure it will work out just fine but im really going to miss you around here
7646662 now youre giving me two weeks to find a replacement right
7646663 oh of course i wouldnt want to put you in a bind
7646664 good thanks by the way i hate that you missed all the excitement around here yesterday
7646665 oh you mean the big showdown between janice and that kyle character
7646666 um hey i need to pay the siding guys like tomorrow did you send the check for your portion yet
7646667 yeah um i need to be living in the new space you were supposed to have built and had completed by last saturday so maybe we can call it even and you can cool your jets on the check you need from me so desperately

7646671 when i got the call i thought they had the wrong person
7646672 i loved her from the minute i met her she was genuine she has an incredible voice and she was open to doing whatever we co wrote together i had an incredible experience with her i was happy when walk away did so well for her
7646673 anything in terms of the show i am not privy to

7646681 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7646682 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7646683 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7646684 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate

7646701 if the city wants to close a mile and a half stretch of road to cars its only fair that we close it to pedestrians and bicycles too
7646702 have fun and see what the city could be like if we drive less
7646703 people drive their cars through here as if the roads were built for them or something
7646704 im all in favor of driving less but i dont understand why the city broke into my garage and towed my prius
7646705 nobody took advantage of the empty streets to do any of the sixteen entertaining and creative activities we listed on the car free day activities webpage

7646711 our first idea was to study sleeping directions of humans e g when doing camping but there are too many constraints
7646712 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on s convenience also came with some downsides
7646713 mostly its fear of the unknown its a brand new environment where are my friends going to sit are they even going to be in my class its that kind of thing and helping kids get ready for that is a key component of the conversation that should be happening this week
7646714 say it aint so joe biden takes credit for patriot act
7646715 riot police deny wolf blitzer entry who is wolf blitzer
7646716 warner bros valora y protege los derechos de propiedad intelectual
7646717 en mi opini n no creo que nuestro t tulo tenga alguna similitud o relaci n con el de harry potter
7646718 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7646719 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7646720 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7646721 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7646722 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7646723 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7646724 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7646725 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying in birds and other smaller animals
7646726 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7646727 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7646728 i dont think so ive come into a different cycle since i decided not to do any more films
7646729 ive a feeling there is something cooking i dont know what it is yet
7646730 i realized after 70 years that my first big break was when i was five i learned to read and write so that for me was the break
7646731 its a bit blurred now it depends on the deal i cant answer that question ive never thought about it
7646732 the people of delaware are not interested in your dentures
7646733 thats what kind of motivates us everyday we come out here and we make a huge difference thats why we wake up in the morning
7646734 the way you do it is you pound it out you work really hard for an hour and you get to hang out for an hour
7646735 we like going out and running through the fair and having people look at us like were crazy
7646736 swill is a mix of all the juices from everybodys drinks and smoothies it just settles at the bottom of the bags
7646737 its gross but its fun actually we all really enjoy
7646738 im pretty sure people would be up to their knees in trash walking around
7646739 its 12 days you could do anything for 12 days right
7646740 you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself and idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth you shall not worship them or serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity sin of the fathers on the children on the third and fourth generations of those who hate me but showing lovingkindness to thousands to those who love me and keep my commandments
7646741 power struggles scientific authority and the creation of practical electricity before edison
7646742 by examining these pioneering technologies and enterprises we can better appreciate edisons achievements
7646743 edisons success represents above all the convergence of many favorable factors financial social scientific and technological that enabled him to pursue his vision relentlessly to the point where his electrical system could be pronounced practical
7646744 i thought i was never going to see my wife and daughter again
7646745 its a small price to pay i know others out there are paying with their arms legs and sometimes their lives
7646746 theres chairs sitting all over the property because no matter where we were there would be a chair there and he would sit there and watch us all day long
7646747 its heart wrenching to know that we were all right here and if we could have come out of the house five minutes earlier we could have saved him
7646748 it really comes down to one big chicken and egg theory
7646749 if we wouldnt be able to raise the funds we wouldnt be here thats why i dont second guess that at all
7646750 we are responsible for tallying votes we run and get water
7646751 i was sitting in my dorm room when i got the call
7646752 and i ran over to my friends room to gloat a little bit shes also a political science major so she understood how excited i was
7646753 this is the center of it all this is the political center and the start of the election
7646754 that defeat in 2004 really fortified the party we had to get our act together and in 2006 we did this year i believe we are going to do well
7646755 you hear so much that young people are considered apathetic i dont think thats true at all
7646756 this campaign and so many campaigns around the country are fueled by youth
7646757 its satisfying this generation is becoming far more active in politics
7646758 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7646759 over the next few months im going to be out talking to small towns telling them oregon is going to get some fresh air led by barack obama
7646760 we wydens are going to make sure barack obama is president of the united states
7646761 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7646762 make no mistake the bush cronies are running mccains campaign down to the minute detail
7646763 if they have their way they will not only maintain their draconian policies they will expand it
7646764 barack obama has been very clear that we are going to call back the big tax cut for the most wealthy and concentrate the benefits on those that most need it
7646765 we have not seen anything yet in terms of what they are going to do to slime the first african american candidate
7646766 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7646767 kurt has a strong enough lead im talking 10 to 15 percent over that weasel
7646768 he can be out there with me in other parts of the state
7646769 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7646770 since diablo iii isnt here i assume will it be playable at blizzcon
7646771 we havent announced anything about what will be playable at blizzcon
7646772 the adjustment in price is a direct reflection of the escalating costs in resins energy freight and converting
7646773 we are grateful to jim for his more than twelve years of dedicated service and for his leadership as president of cfol for the past six years we wish jim the best in his retirement as well as welcome david back to forest as the head of cfol
7646774 jeff and his partners are some of the best known lawyers in real estate and structured finance and they have built a diversified international practice
7646775 they have deep relationships on wall street and in the international financial community that will complement and strengthen our existing finance practice in the us and abroad
7646776 jeff is an innovative leader who recognized the need for a global platform that supports sophisticated cross border work dla piper is a great strategic fit because we have the right mix of capabilities and global reach to support the practice that jeff and his partners have built
7646777 the synergy of their international practice dla piper s global platform and our shared strengths in real estate and corporate finance will create compelling value for clients
7646778 its supposed to be an in your face kind of prevention device its designed to make people go away
7646779 it keeps the crime down it keeps the young kids off the streets
7646780 id rather have big brother looking in on me than anybody else
7646781 they dont deter crime they just move the crime around thats all
7646782 we need that time to sort out and talk with the county and with other agencies to assure these children that their continuum of care will not be interrupted
7646783 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom
7646784 go to support peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama

7646786 went to the clubs dj booth to publicly wish shar a happy birthday
7646787 my kids are by no means ready to watch this 90210
7646788 were not a mom and dad who are home eating bon bons its a couple whos f king
7646789 at one point we were talking about instead of me getting killed at the end of the movie what if i didnt
7646790 my idea was what if he wilsons character puts the gun down and all that goes away and we come back two weeks later and these two guys are standing there watering their lawns staring at each other waiting on the next incident
7646791 there are producers who are brave enough to do stuff like that because thats the way life is and then there are producers who give you this bulls t answer that the audience needs some kind of satisfaction that something happened to the bad guy
7646792 so when that came up there was some animosity amongst a few of us for a couple of days because i said lets shoot both endings and try them at least if my ending doesnt work youll have it for the dvd
7646793 hes awesome in the film i saw it a week before he passed i was talking to his manager who said he never got a chance to see it
7646794 thats a tragedy because its one of the best things hes ever done its the bernie we know and its the bernie we love
7646795 bernie was thinner because hed been sick off and on for a while so he wasnt that american football looking guy that i used to know
7646796 weve lost the ability to be inspired and hes stepped up we are finally inspired by the words that hes saying
7646797 he just didnt stop it was like being stalked the thought of what he might do kept me awake at night
7646798 after reviewing the evidence we determined misdemeanor assault was the appropriate charge
7646799 walked up to the 17 year old female victim grabbed her tank top and bra and pulled them down and exposed her breasts
7646800 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7646801 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7646802 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7646803 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7646804 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7646805 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7646806 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7646807 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7646808 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7646809 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7646810 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7646811 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7646812 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7646813 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7646814 i am here endorsing sen mccain because i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
7646815 and like i said before he has been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know that for me personally i chose him as the best candidate because he has been a fighter for the immigration issue so for me he is the best guy to lead this nation
7646816 hes been married for 15 years he has children aged 14 12 and 10 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina
7646817 in the view of pharmac staff it is difficult to justify the cost of funding 12 months treatment rather than nine weeks treatment in terms of cost effectiveness clinical benefit or safety
7646818 as a result we cannot explain why pharmacs cost projections would be significantly higher than our own
7646819 a message to the boys about how to deal with conflict
7646820 a male and was sports mad like a lot of boys here
7646821 i was trying to draw some sort of similarity there between those elements and those characteristics that many of our boys have and said this is topical and this is what could happen if you cant control your anger

7646826 lately people are realizing that there may be a whole other leg of this credit market fallout that they havent anticipated yet
7646827 between all these factors i dont think you can make the argument that the broad market is at a compelling place to get in
7646828 its totally coincidental that it came about at the same time its been in the works for a while n ow
7646829 share your thoughts with me and help in any way you can
7646830 this is the first year with web 2 0 that candidates gave the tools to the voters allowing them to help raise money
7646831 if you havent built the community you wont raise a lot of money
7646832 mccain hasnt had enough of a runway to build an online base of support that can distribute and use these tools in a robust manner
7646833 were still waiting to see an offer back from boeing to counter the offer we made on saturday
7646834 the company needs to get serious and offer a proposal that gives our members the improvements that they deserve
7646835 we still remain optimistic that we can give a final offer by the labor day weekend
7646836 sometimes i get the impression that analysts are predicting a strike because theyre hearing a lot of the rhetoric out there
7646837 with the news that joe biden joins the democratic presidential ticket as the vice presidential candidate
7646838 fight as if you are right listen as if you are wrong

7646841 increasing the nurse to population ratio is part of the strategy to enhance the working conditions for our nurses so that hopefully they will have more time to look after patients and have better work life balance as well
7646842 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7646843 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7646844 its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7646845 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way

7646855 the individual investor would do well to avoid using any filter rule and i might add any broker who recommends it
7646856 unhappily the signals generated by the dow mechanism have no significance for predicting future price movements
7646857 it is clear that if there are exceptional financial managers they are very rare and there is no way of telling in advance who they will be

7646863 demonstrates the central paradox of portfolio diversification obviously a concentrated portfolio maximizes your chance of a superb result unfortunately at the same time it also maximizes your chance of a poor result this issue gets to the heart of why we invest you can have two possible goals one is to maximize your chances of getting rich i e active management the other is to minimize your odds of failing to meet your goals i e indexing it is important to realize that these goals are mutually exclusive

7646866 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7646867 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample
7646868 after ten days there will be nobody here you all will forget and nobody will remember us im not lying
7646869 satpal is extremely particular about the way these boys live no one goes out of this place and if they do its only after asking us if anyone breaks this rule he is told to leave
7646870 you never know what might influence them outside we have a routine here and they have to follow it
7646871 this is a great moment for the country not just for me or sushil
7646872 whether anybody else expected it or not we were sure because we were fully prepared we put in so much of practice and i could see the other participants were tiring out faster in the new format wrestlers have to defeat up to four opponents in an hour the others just couldnt handle it they didnt have the stamina
7646873 we divide the boys in groups one group plays football the other do some rope climbing while the rest are sent to the wrestling mat these groups keep rotating and apart from that we have special exercises for them satpal oversees all the training sessions
7646874 there is a kitchen here but either satpal or one of us coaches supervises the cooking to make sure everything is in order the dal has to have enough tadka there has to be sufficient ghee
7646875 wrestling matches in the mud can go on for an hour or two its much slower now all international meets are on mats and that is far more technical there are proper costumes shoes and you get points you are given warnings there are a lot more rules
7646876 ahmedabad hyderabad punjab there are so many who want me to take them into my akhada the phone has not stopped ringing but my aim now is to make sure we win 18 out of 21 golds at the 2010 commonwealth games
7646877 im disappointed if youve watched the olympics youll realise we lag behind by at least 10 years we used to be a proud hockey nation but we have not evolved at all over the last few years
7646878 i dont see too many teams having woken up to the concept of modern hockey
7646879 most receive the ball standing which is just not done and the basics of the game have changed its not about stickwork anymore basics now are trapping and hitting
7646880 theres a lot of energy among players but they need guidance or countries like new zealand will just keep improving and well find it difficult to catch up
7646881 there are a couple who tried but nobody extremely exciting
7646882 the tournaments good but a uniform system of training for all academy coaches co ordinated by the chief national coach is important we dont want players moving in ten different directions and the resulting confusion
7646883 i think china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7646884 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7646885 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7646886 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7646887 they can see from the olympics the achievements of 30 years of reform and opening up and the chinese peoples good spirit
7646888 i think what usain did was very cool and i would have done much worse i dont think rogge has ever competed at any level and even if he did im sure he didnt win anything of note no wonder he rogge doesnt understand a champions sentiments
7646889 dear brother we are sorry to hear it and to counteract the evil we will open the window and give the children fresh air

7646892 if the truth were to come out it would cause the pakistani army great embarrassment because it would prove they were not as innocent as they claim to be and the blame does not rest solely on one person as they have tried to make the whole world believe
7646893 for the concerned government it is of course too late today to admit or to confess everything the consequences for the country would be too drastic especially from the americans who have been supporting musharraf through thick and thin

7646898 come election day california will give barack obama and joe biden the biggest victory in the history of our country
7646899 its disappointing when your candidate does not win but we have to remember its not just about us and what our feelings are about the candidates
7646900 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7646901 ive made no decisions ive ruled nothing in and nothing out

7646909 almost certainly the most widely used and cited definition was proposed by clifford geertz religion is a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful persuasive and long lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic

7646911 est claro que estamos ante un caso muy grave en donde altos funcionarios de la junta han barrido para sus empresas y las de sus familiares y que sus dimisiones s lo se han producido tras salir el tema en la prensa ahora deberemos ser nosotros los que no dejemos dormir este tema porque creemos que los ciudadanos tienen el derecho de saber todo ocurrido en este tema
7646912 en el psoe creemos que este asunto no puede darse por cerrado con estas dimisiones sino que vamos a insistir en que se investigue a fondo y en que se depuren las responsabilidades pol ticas que haya que depurar
7646913 est claro que altos responsables pol ticos de la junta deb an estar al tanto de estas irregularidades y ahora por verg enza alguno de esos pol ticos deber a dimitir
7646914 es lo m nimo que se pod a esperar por parte de alguien que solicit la dimisi n inmediata de nuestro presidente
7646915 cuando un d a un juez dictamine que alg n militante del pp incumple la ley nosotros actuaremos en consecuencia pero mientras tanto la verdad tiene poco sentido hacerlo

7646966 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7646967 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7646968 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7646969 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7646970 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7646971 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7646972 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted

7646993 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7646994 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true

7647032 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure

7647069 in the first and still the most comprehensive study of global soil misuse scientists at the netherlands estimated in 1991 that humankind has degraded more than 7 5 million square miles of land our species in other words is rapidly trashing an area the size of the combined
7647070 everyone agrees that the explanation lies in large part with the char or biochar that gives the soil its darkness this char is made when organic matter smoulders in an oxygen poor environment rather than burns the particles of char produced this way are somehow able to gather up nutrients and water that might otherwise be washed down below the reach of roots they become homes for populations of microorganisms that turn the soil into that spongy fragrant dark material that gardeners everywhere love to plunge their hands into
7647071 bio char biomass derived black carbon is highly stable in soil and can persist hundreds and thousands of years it is much more stable than even the most stabilized carbon in soil it therefore constitutes a much longer carbon sink than most other sequestration options such as no tillage manure applications or afforestation

7647157 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
7647158 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
7647159 pdx is pleased to be the first aggregator of multi pharmacy electronic prescription records to enter into a strategic relationship with google this new agreement will allow our pharmacy customers both chain and independents the ability to integrate client prescription history into google health at the users request
7647160 we believe users should have access to their prescription history and medical records and should be able to organize this information in one safe and centralized place
7647161 working with pdx will enable several nationwide pharmacies to connect with google health giving millions of patients access to their own personal data

7647212 under our current system of safety and soundness regulation supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7647213 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7647214 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7647215 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7647216 oh just wondering why is there a man in our living room taking it apart
7647217 oh its okay honey dont worry he knows what hes doing

7647222 mum its really important to dharma besides it could be worse
7647223 you mean that dreadful man with the oh come on dear the silvers in the other room
7647224 after all darling this is a very expensive set imagine what would happen if some pieces of it went missing no dont be ridiculous young man of course we dont actually use it whatever for
7647225 oh its that bracelet you gave me back at woodstock of course its alien and i never thanked you properly for it it was so sweet of you would you like some more tea
7647226 yeah well until it moves the earth and twenty six other planets across the universe to use it as its personal everything destroyer
7647227 hey i dont know how they do things in england but sneaking up on people is not nice here in america
7647228 im not stalking you i was just up here examining the dalek remains
7647229 the doctor of what and dont you dare say gynecology because im not falling for that
7647230 nice to meet you nurse but i have to leave i have something i must do
7647231 sunny actually its mary alice but no one calls me that
7647232 finding where the rest of the dalek remains are and getting them out of scientists reach
7647233 but but they would try to kill us all again
7647234 i dont think saying please and thank you works when madmen are making scientific discoveries
7647235 youre probably right but i always try that first and then work my way up to yelling
7647236 this is the tardis a time machine were not traveling in time were just using it as a really fast car of sorts
7647237 i normally get impossible but ill settle for insanely cool
7647238 why i agreed to come we have to stop them
7647239 excuse me sir but before you kill us or call for help can we please talk to you
7647240 i understand that you want to be the first to figure out the interworkings of a dalek and that multitudes of honor would come from it but its wrong
7647241 then what do you want i have work to do
7647242 these daleks were created to kill to destroy it was their purpose in life you cant think that bringing them back to life wont cause trouble and kill more people
7647243 they are under controlled circumstances and in a safe environment the world will be safe while the daleks are here being retrained
7647244 ever heard the expression you cant teach an old dog new tricks
7647245 were going to train them to cooperate and coordinate with our life and to help us
7647246 thats not going to work it hasnt worked any other time thats been applied even with intelligent humans
7647247 im sorry but i have to ask you to leave
7647248 and im going to have to ask you to stop your experiments
7647249 we will as soon as you put down the gun and stop your work on the daleks
7647250 because you have no idea how many lives and planets have been destroyed by them billions of lives have been lost not just on earth but countless other planets as well so if you value life at all you will stop
7647251 fine fine ill stop im getting too old for this
7647252 does anyone else know about the true form of the daleks
7647253 not of my knowledge but that does not go to say that they did not do the same thing as me
7647254 i was going to use the money from the pictures to get into art school but i think im going to study astronomy instead
7647255 you did great back there i didnt expect you to be one to act
7647256 you could have easily hit him unconscious but you chose to knock the gun from his hand why didnt you hurt him
7647257 well if you were ever desperate to escape you could use it
7647258 yeah and what a great job you did with your pleases and thank yous
7647259 no i dreamed of art school at one point but now i know its impossible
7647260 well for people without time machines there are a lot of impossible things
7647261 sunny everyone who comes with me gets hurt in some way i dont want that to happen to you or anyone else its not fair to you it would be selfish of me to put you in such danger more than i did today
7647262 no it would be selfish of you to hog the whole tardis to yourself and not share the experience of travelling in time

7647306 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
7647307 ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
7647308 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict
7647309 the so called little ice age in the northern hemisphere a few hundred years ago was caused by an average drop in temperature of less than a degree celsius
7647310 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
7647311 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
7647312 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
7647313 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
7647314 the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
7647315 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
7647316 we are creating a source for irrigation that otherwise would not be used
7647317 every drop of water can make the land here potentially into agricultural land
7647318 with the depletion of the water table from the ground there are opportunities for saltier water to seep in and contaminate the fresh water
7647319 this is not a water crisis its a political crisis
7647320 this will stabilize the water situation in the medium and long term
7647321 the difference about today is that there are the technological tools to cope with this crisis
7647322 when people take responsibility and dont wait for rainfall alone we can assist nature and help find solutions
7647323 the epas refusal to control pollution from oil refineries is the latest example of the bush administrations do nothing policy on global warming

7647325 for decades indian point has maintained that its cooling systems have no impact on hudson river fish
7647326 at long last the dec has pout an end to this fiction
7647327 this ruling actually gives us the opportunity to bring in the argument that this could impact electric power reliability in new york that the actual construction challenges may make it unfeasible
7647328 we still have to determine if building cooling towers is in the public interest

7647383 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7647384 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7647385 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7647386 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7647387 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7647388 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7647389 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7647390 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7647391 prior to launching street view we reached out to several privacy and public service organizations to discuss the new feature and solicit feedback
7647392 there is nothing around their home intended to prevent the occasional entry by a stranger onto their driveway there is no gate no keep out sign nor guard dog standing watch
7647393 live in a residential community in the twenty first century united states every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass
7647394 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
7647395 we have plans to launch nano by october but many people dont want that to happen
7647396 making sure you are on tv heard on radio have a presence on the streets things like that are important and we have done a couple of concerts holding a concert was a big deal because apart from it being the first time any movie has done a concert with the cast it gave a great platform for us to interact directly with the audience of the movie
7647397 we have been so authentic about our presentation on the film and we have used that to tell the people that this is what you are going to get when you go to the theatre and thats what people want to see
7647398 frankly after playing a mother of six on television this wasnt tough its always said that films are always male dominated and on tv its the female who is the protagonist now that i know very clearly what the truth is i did my share on tv and now this is also an experience
7647399 before we shot the film there was a whole look test that they did and everyone had different ideas about the way they wanted to look i too had my mind set on certain things and i think if kd his character didnt have that look the band wouldnt look that good the beard adds so much to my character
7647400 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7647401 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7647402 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7647403 gt listen to and comment on last nights jihadi killer hour
7647404 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7647405 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7647406 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7647407 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7647408 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7647409 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7647410 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7647411 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7647412 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7647413 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7647414 the epas refusal to control pollution from oil refineries is the latest example of the bush administrations do nothing policy on global warming
7647415 oil refineries contribute substantially to global warming posing grave threats to new yorks environment health and economy
7647416 we are creating a source for irrigation that otherwise would not be used
7647417 every drop of water can make the land here potentially into agricultural land
7647418 with the depletion of the water table from the ground there are opportunities for saltier water to seep in and contaminate the fresh water
7647419 this is not a water crisis its a political crisis
7647420 this will stabilize the water situation in the medium and long term
7647421 the difference about today is that there are the technological tools to cope with this crisis
7647422 when people take responsibility and dont wait for rainfall alone we can assist nature and help find solutions
7647423 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
7647424 ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers

7647426 the so called little ice age in the northern hemisphere a few hundred years ago was caused by an average drop in temperature of less than a degree celsius
7647427 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
7647428 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
7647429 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
7647430 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
7647431 the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
7647432 hey im gonna go to wal mart to buy toothpaste wanna tag along
7647433 for decades indian point has maintained that its cooling systems have no impact on hudson river fish
7647434 at long last the dec has pout an end to this fiction
7647435 this ruling actually gives us the opportunity to bring in the argument that this could impact electric power reliability in new york that the actual construction challenges may make it unfeasible
7647436 we still have to determine if building cooling towers is in the public interest
7647437 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
7647438 have you ever just looked out the window and dreamed

7647442 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business
7647443 our goal with these new mobile services is to give quickbooks online users the edge they need to compete and manage their busy lives by keeping tabs on their business even when they are out of the office
7647444 given the virtual nature of our interactions iphone support helps us be more productive
7647445 while waiting for an appointment i was able to check quickbooks online using my iphone to look up parents with open balances and send them an e mail reminder to pay their bill

7647489 our companys substantial net asset value is not reflected in our stock price the share repurchase program capitalizes on this opportunity to materially benefit our shareholders
7647490 in addition we anticipate increasing capital expenditures in 2009 and beyond to accelerate the value of our substantial unbooked resource potential our capital efficient portfolio is generating material free cash flow at current prices enabling us to both increase our capital spending levels and complete the share repurchases over the next three years all while targeting a debt to cap ratio of between 25 and 35 percent proceeds from previously announced property sales will continue to be directed to debt reduction and we continue to believe that our business model is enhanced by the financial flexibility afforded investment grade companies

7647546 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7647547 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7647548 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7647549 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7647550 the healing process is going to be a little longer than four days

7647580 there has been a race against technology as we watch software become obsolete almost as soon as it is installed in our computers all of us have stored personal memories or favorite music on 8 track tapes floppy disks or 8 mm film in many cases these technologies are now relics and we have no way to access the stored information imagine this problem multiplied millions and millions of what the federal government is facing today but thanks to era

7647600 i am very grateful to the congress and the president for their recognition of the importance of making our documentary heritage as widely available as possible extending the research room hours goes a long way in helping us attain this goal this increase in hours underlines our commitment to open government
7647601 i would also like to acknowledge the enthusiastic support of our user communities
7647602 the wall is more than just 58 000 plus names
7647603 many of these people were my friends and now footnote com helps me create a remembrance of these fine gentlemen
7647604 the records of the vietnam war in the national archives are essential resources for veterans to revisit their history and establish their rights
7647605 these extensive files are mined by scholars every day as they continue to interpret and understand this pivotal period in american history
7647606 we know that there are many untold experiences represented on that wall and we hope that this interactive version of the memorial helps those affected by the war by sharing their stories
7647607 series focuses on american history and identity senators harry reid and hillary rodham clinton lynne cheney award winning filmmaker ken burns and historian john hope franklin are among those featured in previous programs some of which may be viewed on the national archives

7647609 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the sixties trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7647610 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old
7647611 there is a truly dedicated effort within government to accomplish declassification more than one billion pages have been declassified since fiscal year 1995 however a significant portion of this material has not yet been made available to the public there is much more classified material yet to be reviewed and the task gets ever harder as the volume increases and materials are created in more complex formats our recommendations to develop a way to identify historically significant documents could be an important contribution to the effort to get information out to the public in a timely manner
7647612 because we have laws and executive orders that require or allow for the declassification review of virtually all classified information there has been a sense that nothing can be done to improve the declassification system short of applying more resources to the problem i think the boards report demonstrates the fallacy in this thinking we have identified a number of things that could be done to make more efficient and effective use of our existing resources to apply those resources where they would make the most difference
7647613 i think most of the people in the world know already what is london
7647614 there is no reason for someone to have rifles with scopes

7647616 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

7647618 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7647619 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7647620 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7647621 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7647622 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7647623 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7647624 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7647625 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7647626 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7647627 pana in prezent s au inscris cateva sute de oameni daca sa zicem s ar inscrie undeva la 3 000 am putea spune ca ajungem undeva la break even dar nu cred ca acest lucru se va intampla la acest meci
7647628 privind din aceasta perspectiva sper sa realizam profit la urmatoarele transmii probabil vom crea si pachete de 10 15 meciuri inca nu stim sigur vedem cum va fi primit steaua galata si vom hotari ulterior pretul per meci nu va creste
7647629 banda nu va fi problema nu avem practic o limita de vizitatori sistemul de transmisie este foarte ok
7647630 este in primul rand o miscare pentru branding nu cautam neaparat profit oferim astfel o alternativa transmisiunii tv targetam de asemenea si pe cei din afara romaniei care nu pot urmari in alt fel acest meci
7647631 s a ajuns astfel in situatia in care pe piata bancara exista inca doua trei institutii care mai au resurse de lichiditate iar la nivel de sistem exista o nevoie acuta
7647632 in viitor nivelul dobanzilor la depozitele in lei din piata va depinde de cel al inflatiei deoarece in functie de valoarea indicelui se va construi politica monetara a bancii centrale
7647633 oricum acest trend al cresterii nivelului dobanzilor pare sa fie aproape de punctul maxim
7647634 abia acum vedem efectele majore ale crizei incepute anul anterior pib ul sua creste destul de putin in schimb inflatia isi face de cap
7647635 in zona romania se afla intr o situatie aparte in conditiile in care indicatorii macroeconomici nu arata bine sustine radulescu
7647636 probabil nu mai devreme de sfarsitul lui 2009 inceputul lui 2010 pentru sistemul bancar local linistirea pietelor ar putea insemna un nou influx de fonduri straine desi nu la o scara atat de mare cum a fost in anii 2004 2006
7647637 anii anteriori au adus scaderi de preturi la credite generate in special de concurenta din sistem dupa ce tulburarile de pe pietele financiare se vor calma ma astept ca acest trend sa se reinitieze
7647638 probabil ca ponderea neperformantelor in total credite va creste de fapt aceasta este o tendinta care se observa de cateva luni deja insa raportul credite neperformante total credite al sistemului bancar de la noi este inca scazut
7647639 acum numarul creditelor nerambursate este destul de scazut insa pe termen mediu si lung gradul de solvabilitate al clientilor poate fi afectat de o scadere a cresterii economice si de somaj
7647640 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
7647641 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
7647642 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
7647643 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7647644 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7647645 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7647646 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7647647 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7647648 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7647649 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7647650 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7647651 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7647652 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7647653 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7647654 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7647655 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7647656 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7647657 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7647658 no one works for someone we all just work together
7647659 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7647660 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7647661 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7647662 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7647663 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7647664 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7647665 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7647666 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7647667 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7647668 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7647669 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7647670 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7647671 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7647672 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7647673 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7647674 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7647675 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7647676 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7647677 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7647678 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7647679 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7647680 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7647681 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7647682 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7647683 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7647684 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7647685 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7647686 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7647687 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7647688 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7647689 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7647690 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7647691 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7647692 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7647693 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7647694 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7647695 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7647696 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7647697 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7647698 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7647699 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7647700 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7647701 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7647702 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7647703 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
7647704 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
7647705 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
7647706 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7647707 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7647708 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7647709 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7647710 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7647711 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7647712 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7647713 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7647714 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7647715 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7647716 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7647717 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7647718 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7647719 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7647720 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7647721 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7647722 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7647723 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7647724 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7647725 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7647726 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7647727 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7647728 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7647729 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7647730 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7647731 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7647732 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7647733 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7647734 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7647735 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7647736 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7647737 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7647738 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7647739 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7647740 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7647741 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7647742 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7647743 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7647744 this is a planning took where all things are going
7647745 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7647746 skyll inte p mig jag r stade p den feta killen i kostym
7647747 people realize they are going to leave here united as a party and i am very much encouraged by the attitude
7647748 quand on a pas de t te il faut avoir des jambes
7647749 they either want to belong to the roman catholic church or they want to start their own church
7647750 in the area of liturgy they make up their own rules in the way they worship god
7647751 we do have a radical point of view in terms of christian prayer
7647752 and we have to confront the issues that the archbishop has raised
7647753 it is vital to the people of our community that angioplasty is accessible when its needed most
7647754 as a local business we chose to lend our support to this important cause and are thrilled that so many others contributed by participating
7647755 when the second cardiac catheterization lab is built and 500 patients are able access angioplasty close to home the individuals involved in this event can take pride in knowing they helped make it possible
7647756 for others its laziness youre too lazy to work and support your children im talking about men you call yourself mr mom god calls you a bum st paul says you are worse than an infidel let me look you right in the eye and tell you that hell is your future home if all you do is sit on your backside and let your wife support you in your life
7647757 the congress comes during a rough year for rural oregon
7647758 budget cuts closed the state office of rural policy the oregon congressional delegation has been unable to win renewal of a county payment program crucial to many budgets and a new state ethics law led to widespread resignations on local boards and commissions
7647759 too many urban decisions ignite wildfires of unintended consequence that ravage rural communities as they drive home they might do well to remember just how much of this states wealth plywood to pinot noir remains tied up in rural lands

7647764 there is evidence that a well established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation
7647765 she secretly films sermons given to the women only congregation in which female preachers recite extremist and intolerant beliefs
7647766 kill him kill him you have to kill him you understand this is islam
7647767 the reporter visits the bookshop and discovers books and dvds still on sale promoting extremist anti semitic misogynistic and intolerant messages
7647768 films inside a key saudi funded muslim organisation which claims to promote tolerance and integration yet distributes literature which promotes intolerance for non muslims an extreme version of sharia law and teachings which support discrimination against women
7647769 investigates the role of the saudi arabian religious establishment in spreading a hard line fundamentalist islamic ideology in the uk the very ideology the government claims to be tackling
7647770 preachers proclaim the supremacy of islam preach hatred for non muslims and for muslims who do not follow their extreme beliefs and predict a coming jihad
7647771 i was appalled by some of the things we saw it must be investigated i want to know what this stuff was and why it took a tv documentary to expose it the mosque must know what is happening inside its building
7647772 its deeply disturbing that this preaching of hate is still going on there should be a further investigation into the bookshop and what these people are preaching
7647773 it is important to have a muslim statesman as the countrys national leader we will promote this idea not only to the president but also to anyone willing to offer himself as the future leader
7647774 the country is in need of a leader who is not just a politician or the chairman of a political party we need a statesman who can take on great responsibility for the sake of the countrys development
7647775 our idea is purely a suggestion we think all future leader hopefuls will accept this idea because islam is a rahmatan lil alamin blessing for the universe
7647776 the assault was perpetuated with an aluminum baseball bat and a knife a deadly weapon by waiting for her to return home and striking her in the head several times with the bat and then stabbing her multiple times before leaving the scene
7647777 the proposal itself required that the financial arrangements be verified by a letter from a financial institution that the project had been reviewed
7647778 and the institution is willing to finance the entire project in wells fargos letter on behalf of the urban project they did not say theyd be willing to they said they were reviewing it but they did not provide the documentation saying that they would finance the project
7647779 we still maintain the concept of keeping the buildings on this end of the site lower so that the view from the bypass is preserved
7647780 and the same thing from the north end of the site but weve pushed the buildings closer to the street to give it a more urban feel
7647781 because we are very confident that we can make this project work and in the best interest of the city we had the room in our budgeting to pay more for the land so were willing to do so
7647782 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher

7647804 any delusions or any disappointments that you know in some quarters her negatives are high
7647805 together made a compact at the beginning of this campaign that when they got to the end of the process they were gonna look at each other and see the same person across the table that started on this journey and they were gonna try very hard not to let this change them
7647806 oh i get you i understand you you dont threaten me i get this family
7647807 oh i learned something about barack obama that resonates in my own family i know someone whos had a similar struggle

7647809 id like to wait until signing day to decide unless the pressure gets to be too much i just want to take my time but i know that i really need to start thinking about recruiting a little bit more
7647810 i missed three games knee and ankle injury or i would have had a lot more

7647818 they have a lot of tradition and i grew up on them
7647819 ive always liked alabama a lot and ive always loved their defense
7647820 i like how the defense at bama plays lights out regardless if they are up by 50 or down by 50
7647821 coach saban is changing it around over there and hes doing a good job
7647822 i like how he wants to get alabama back to where they used to be

7647827 after my freshman year i was just thinking about graduating and going into the military
7647828 it wasnt until after my sophomore season that things started getting serious
7647829 i was the main leader on defense for our team as a sophomore and people started talking about me playing college ball even then i really only figured id get an offer from alabama or some in state programs

7647842 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7647843 it may not be as good as the headliners of the other three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the american people are going to face in november
7647844 he can clear his thoughts and write without the distractions of home
7647845 have you taken a pad and pencil and figured out how many times barack obama has flip flopped on iraq
7647846 im under oath today as a surrogate for john mccain to speak to you about this great american
7647847 too many people describe themselves as democrats or republicans but forget that were all americans
7647848 its more of a what the hell are you doing thing
7647849 he has no allegiance to the party he was once a part of
7647850 he says hes an independent but if you speak at the gop convention if you endorse mccain for president youre a republican end of story
7647851 watching joe lieberman go around the bend is one of the strangest things ive ever seen in politics
7647852 its like two quarter pound stools of alien space shit crashed into a toxic waste dumpster in stamford connecticut fucked and out came their mutilated blood soaked carcass of a baby rat child senator joseph lieberman
7647853 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7647854 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7647855 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7647856 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7647857 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7647858 many independent and democratic voters are supporting john mccains positive vision for america
7647859 denver in a nondescript office building less than a mile from the democratic confab at the pepsi center a couple dozen republicans will be monitoring the democrats every word this week waiting to attack
7647860 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7647861 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7647862 and i know he has been supportive of secretary rices state department
7647863 i think secretary rice has made clear who she intends to vote for and that will be senator mccain and whomever he chooses to join him on the ticket
7647864 im sure theres also a baseball game on tonight too
7647865 we consider him our third senator in pennsylvania hes been good to pennsylvania

7647869 we were wondering if larger animals also have this magnetic sense
7647870 sometimes it took hours and hours to find some pictures with good resolution
7647871 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7647872 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7647873 ive never noticed that my cows all face the same way
7647874 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible
7647875 we need to think about some really fundamental things that this sensory ability provides in animals

7647881 hur farlig en s kallad frusen konflikt kan vara med tanke p att de georgiska ledarna blev galna
7647882 i think were right where we should be i think we had a pretty successful camp it allowed a lot of the younger guys to get a lot of experience guys like who needed a lot more reps than they usually get and because guys like chris mcgaha nate kimbrough and even mike jones were out for long periods of time during camp that gave guys chances to make some catches in some scrimmages and make some big plays for us i think our offense is where it should be our offensive line did a great job and i think the running backs we have are a good group i think were in a good situation right now
7647883 i think our defense is a little bit faster this year they seem to be blitzing us a lot more in camp this year than they did last year and maybe even more than they did during the season theyve been mixing it up a little bit this year too doing some different things coverage wise playing a little more single safety than they usually do moving around a lot more than they usually do with their linebackers and their defensive backs trying to confuse you a little more i think our defense had a great camp and hopefully can carry that over to saturday
7647884 well obviously its my second year in this offense with coach dennis erickson and coach rich olson so i think i have an even better grasp of the offense than i did last year and i think even more is that i have been here for awhile so i continually learn how to prepare for games better and how to practice better the game has slowed down a lot for me overall decision making knowing when to try and make plays when to cut my losses and throw the ball away and trusting guys to make plays around me
7647885 i havent spent much time thinking about it as my final year i mean obviously i know its my final year and its weird to think about it as my last season opener it feels like everything is the last for me im sure once it gets later in the season once we get close to senior night ill think about it a lot more and it will be emotional for me
7647886 i would tell them to have as much fun as they can i would tell them to expect to be nervous full of emotion real intense but to go out there and trust what theyre doing and what their coaches have been telling them and to relax and have fun
7647887 well its a start the first game ive mentioned many times is an exciting time everybodys anxious to see where theyre at i dont know that you can continue to practice against each other and find out where you are at it will be a start for us to find exactly where that is ive known nau head coach jerome souers for many years and he does a tremendous job up there and has done so for a long period of time seems like the last couple times theyve played us we were lucky to get out alive thats how i look at it i look back on my career and when i was at oregon state the year we won the fiesta bowl and lost one game we opened with eastern washington in corvallis and had to score at the end of the game to win it we were very fortunate to win that football game a year before that we played georgia southern in corvallis and won by three points so nau has a great program and their players are going to be hungry they dont have anything to lose they are going to give us everything we want the bottom line for us is we need to be ready to play its the start of a season its an opponent that if we dont play well we will get beat thats the nature of it the old clich that i say all the time is this is the start of twelve opportunities for us were excited to play the game and get back into it i know our players are and they understand the situation some of them were here a couple years ago when we played northern arizona and were tied going into the fourth quarter were all aware of that thats how were going to face it and hopefully we play well and see where were at
7647888 they play with three down guys with two down guys they play with five defensive backs they play with three linebackers they change it up standing guys up and putting guys down its kind of the old bear defense cal poly runs it actually dick tomey ran it at arizona for a long period of time a flex defense is what we call it and it can cause confusion theyll bring different people theyll blitz quite a bit theyll bring five guys you just dont know where they are coming from ive faced it in my coaching career quite often its not like we havent seen it before you have to try and keep it as simple as you can particularly in your running game and pass protections because theyll bring guys that are unaccounted for just because of what they do blitz wise we have to be very aware of that we started working against it on sunday and will continue to im sure that theyve got a plan when youre in a situation like that where you have nothing to lose you gamble a little bit more but thats their style and they have a good secondary they play a lot of man coverage back there hopefully we can take advantage of that it is unique you dont see it a lot but the people that run it run it very well
7647889 we saw him yesterday and he practiced very well i dont know that hes 100 percent but hes close to it unless theres a drastic change in his condition i would expect him to start and play
7647890 well know more about brandon smith practiced the other day and has a chance to come back and play has been beat up with an ankle but it looked like yesterday hell be able to play so we should be fairly healthy we should have most of our players back is a question mark from what i saw yesterday with his hamstring
7647891 what did he miss last season one field goal i think thats going to be hard for anybody thomas is going to be a huge weapon for us theres no question about it we have a great deal of confidence in him and hes got a great deal of confidence in himself the biggest thing is you have a new snapper and a new holder that becomes huge theyve spent a lot of time together tom ohmart will be the snapper and is the holder to me i dont know if its thomas as much as it is the timing of all that but hes kicked very well in the preseason and i look for him to have a great year now is he going to have as great a year as last season i would hope he would but that is a very difficult year to follow hell win some games for us i can guarantee you that
7647892 they are battling theyll both play quite a bit in this game they are that close we just have to see to me its a name thats starting theyll both play which is good it could be good it could be bad i think its good because we have two guys competing on the other side is playing very well he will be our fourth corner as a true freshman hes had a very good camp as time goes on you could flip him too well see what happens there
7647893 dimitri nance and keegan herring are our two backs that we are going to use primarily
7647894 we plan on playing eight or nine true freshman in this game and for the year starting on defense with josh jordan gerell robinson
7647895 its just kind of how it shook out you never know until they get here and see how they adjust its hard and we had some depth problems our offensive front is missing a class or two that we have to fill with freshmen the linebacker situation they came in and played well and they can help us on special teams was a quarterback a corner a receiver he was everything out of crenshaw high school we decided to put him at safety because hes athletic and he picked it up very well we felt he had the physical ability to play and he has picked it up pretty well before camp hes probably the only one i would have thought physically could come in and play right away but thats where we are at right now and well see what is going to happen
7647896 when i quit getting jitters i better quit the business i always have jitters for every game i have jitters now and hopefully ill have jitters twenty years from now thats what its all about the excitement of coaching the game and coaching the opener and coaching every game you play if youre not nervous and when i say nervous i mean stomach jitters nothing other than that because you want to win and you want to be successful as a team you always want to have that i have a great deal of confidence its not because of lack of confidence its just my nature i guess
7647897 i believe the second season if everything is equal you should be a little bit better because you know what you are doing offensively i believe rudy carpenter his receivers the offensive line are all going to be better because they are familiar with what they are doing the offensive front even though we lost some players are more familiar with the technique and the things that we want to do in our offensive scheme of things as far as run calls blocking and protection our backs are more familiar with the protections and so forth so it will make a difference same thing defensively with what we are doing they have been in that system under coach craig bray so that will make it simpler however our schedule this year is quite different than it was a year ago so that makes a difference too the schedule where you play and all that works into it i feel a lot better going into this year than last year because those guys have been through a spring and a fall that makes a big difference
7647898 without a question yes i mean our second year at washington state was pretty good they were familiar with what was going on the same thing at oregon state overall just familiarizing yourself with whats going on will help
7647899 the senior group there arent a lot of them but theyve taken things over

7647910 bo diddley revolutionized the texture of pop music he put the rhythm in the foreground stripping away the rest and customized the space with tremolo distortion echo and reverb the way he chunked on the lower strings was a primary model for what was later known as rhythm guitar he had lots of space ot fill up with his guitar because his reocrds had no piano and no bass which also meant no harmonic compilations
7647911 no other first generation rock n roller started out by taking on a mystical persona and then singing about his adventures in the third person by name checking himself throughout the lyrics of his debut record bo diddley established what we would now call his brand today this approach to marketing is routine for rappers but bo diddley was there 30 years before he was practically rapping anyway with stream of consciousness rhyming over a rhythm loop

7647917 we wanted to do something that was a bit of fun and not the standard bus bench ad
7647918 that way we get a lot of exposure to what we think is a great demographic for our product
7647919 for those who export it has been and will continue to be through the holiday season a more challenging period for them
7647920 it might be a little worse in the u s but i still think the trend will be to purchasing later and a little bit less and being a little bit more selective
7647921 we expect to see continued growth over last year but at a pace that is softer than it was in 2007
7647922 theres no question we have seen a small decline in employment in canada we have seen the cost of gas chew into family budgets but generally factors are still quite positive for canadian consumers

7647932 who cares how many newspapers blogs or podcasts are out there if someone finds value in any of this content they stick with it if they dont they move on ive seen terribly written newspapers with huge readership just go check out the tabloid section of your local newsstand and ive seen the most brilliant of blogs build up readership that trounces the digital darwinism your content does not evolve because you are using the latest and greatest technology your content evolves when people read it connect to it share it tell others and continue to pay attention to it

7647946 its about continually looking at your work force and looking at your economic projections and trying to bring those in line
7647947 we thought that we had that two months ago but with the worsening economy we just need to do more
7647948 other people were hired more recently than them there are people who have been working at the paper for less time
7647949 it is our belief that seniority as described in article vi section 1 of the guild contract was not followed in these layoffs
7647950 morrow and fisher had great seniority at the paper koenig though newly full time at the paper had worked part time at the paper previously
7647951 singleton and larosa were not the most recent hires at the paper though they may have been the most recent paraprofessionals hired at the paper
7647952 the guild contract makes no distinction between departments or job titles when addressing seniority issues
7647953 thanks to the contract these exiting employees have first preference for re employment within 2 years but we are disappointed they are being forced to exit in the first place
7647954 we are also disappointed that our proposal on aug 15 to explore the idea of volunteers for buyouts was rejected by management
7647955 it looks like we are at the point where we need to lose 28 pages from the paper each week in order to get our newsprint consumption to the level that is tolerable
7647956 every newspaper is going through various operations to reduce spending without it damaging the paper we look at what can newspapers give readers and what can they eliminate
7647957 some of the feature sections are less likely to survive
7647958 feature sections have usually been targeted to women readers they are the largest audience but women are much more likely to be reading on the weekend
7647959 do we really need to have four our focus groups indicate people would like to have a single juicy feature section with a magazine flavor
7647960 we are looking at content we dont provide uniquely or do uniquely well
7647961 we believe that is part of the formula for success
7647962 if you can trim a quarter million dollars from newsprint costs you can save four jobs
7647963 we are also looking at cutting back on the ap but i dont think we would cut it completely

7647975 thatd be neat if we could do that 10 years later
7647976 we will have to work for it which is good we need to do that
7647977 there were unique challenges of playing gay ball in a straight world
7647978 but just because were gay doesnt mean we cant play ball
7647979 the stereotypical viewpoint of what comprises a gay athlete may need to be rethought explain that to your wife or girlfriend that you just got your asses beat by a bunch of gay guys
7647980 but theres so much money does a gay athlete jeopardize his ability to earn money in endorsements that would be difficult to turn your back on potential earnings just to make a statement
7647981 as society continues to accept the reality that there are gay people out there who are athletes i hope it becomes more acceptable

7648101 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7648102 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunitions to our armed forces
7648103 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
7648104 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition this contract provides precisely that
7648105 you can imagine that the rate of production that we are now at its been some achievement to keep that going in that period to make sure that we deliver on time
7648106 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7648107 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7648108 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7648109 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
7648110 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
7648111 he still has reaction where once he goes for a little bit he has to watch it because it gets sore on him
7648112 hes never had a good offseason hes never had the strength hes never had the complete commitment to the offseason like hes had
7648113 i really cant thats what this is all about i want to see that i can play i havent made my decision yet but i am going to do everything i can to play thats what this is all about
7648114 i have to go make this last trip and the get back with the team and figure it all out
7648115 this is all about me playing thats all i want to do
7648116 it could be career threatening if i did play its a possibility that possibility is still open
7648117 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7648118 det b sta r nog n r hon ligger och sover
7648119 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7648120 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7648121 during our national convention we will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
7648122 looking out from this podium tonight i see a diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the unity of our party and the success of our 50 state strategy we are the most vibrant and inclusive and energized party and we are ready to compete in all 50 states it is the democratic party that can effect the change that america needs
7648123 event which is aiming to be a zero emissions alternative to todays high performance
7648124 in the sustainable future that we want to live in you can still drive around in circles just because you want to
7648125 formula zero will be a competition between fuel cell technologies
7648126 one of the issues in introducing new technologies is customer awareness and acceptance and anything which demonstrates or supports that is welcomed
7648127 the students that are doing these events now are potentially the managers of our technology centres in 10 or 15 years time
7648128 we do not discuss individual benefits cases but can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits
7648129 the play on words is fully intended because obamas radical leftist politics driven by the cult of personality he has intentionally manufactured would be an abomination in that the result of those policies would be to lead the united states in a costly and self destructive direction both at home and abroad
7648130 in all my writings on that subject of race i have been a strong opponent of any form of racial violence and a strong advocate for eliminating all forms of racial discrimination inequality and injustice
7648131 will run negative ad after negative ad attack after attack with the goal of making you lose focus on the issues and focus on me and try to make me out to be a risky scary guy
7648132 he thinks the new rule on out of bounds plays will result in the loss of eight to 10 plays per game meaning the two clock rules are expected to cause the loss of a net four or five plays
7648133 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7648134 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life
7648135 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7648136 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7648137 theyre a leading company in their field they produce good products and they have stepped into the breach when necessary so in six months everybody will have forgotten about it
7648138 maple leafs strategy is almost a textbook copy of what johnson amp johnson did
7648139 so if this is done well it can really mean that the brand doesnt have to suffer too much
7648140 what theyre doing is protecting the brand and its the brand that matters in the long term for maple leaf without the brand they dont have anything
7648141 so theyve been very very proactive about it unusually so because most companies that go through crises of this nature tend to hide its quite commendable from a business point of view
7648142 i think theres enough lawyers out there that like this kind of business that there will be lawsuits
7648143 they can recover a very high proportion of their business maybe 95 per cent 98 per cent theres only a few hardcore people who wont go back to eating roast beef but if they dont handle it properly then it can be a significant loss of business
7648144 the reality is that the risks are huge because youre not just looking at an isolated part of the business but youre looking at a risk to every product that has the maple leaf name on it
7648145 its going to take some time for them to recover from it no matter what they do but this kind of thing at least can help keep them in peoples minds as a company thats reasonably trustworthy and when there is a problem they face up to it and deal with it
7648146 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7648147 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7648148 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7648149 hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7648150 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7648151 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7648152 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7648153 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7648154 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7648155 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7648156 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7648157 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
7648158 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
7648159 but she is only a child maybe she doesn t understand why she did it
7648160 we saved a lot of people s lives al qaida uses women to blow themselves up because they are easier to brainwash
7648161 in our culture we can t touch or search the bodies of women
7648162 i didn t know anything about my daughter with a suicide vest
7648163 we just found out that he worked for al qaida
7648164 they twist the facts to make it sound right for this young person to do
7648165 if we didn t have the sahwa in this area the terrorists would still be here
7648166 i m sure there is former everything in these groups
7648167 it gives them a lot more authority to stand up against insurgents
7648168 i started teaching in the south bronx in 1959 i taught there for five years
7648169 the first two years i taught kids that didn t speak any english they had just come from puerto rico that summer it helped prepare me for dodds i didn t know it at the time but i would eventually teach kids who spoke different languages
7648170 what i love about dodds kids is that they re really savvy about all the cultures
7648171 they re well traveled and have more of a global outlook it s almost like teaching in the 1950s it s a small town atmosphere on base and you run into your students shopping or when you re in church i love that part of it i like the family feel where you know everybody and everybody knows you
7648172 in the dodds system you always have at least one parent employed and they all have medical and dental benefits
7648173 you don t always have that in the states but with military students deployments can add stress to the children s lives fortunately naples isn t a big deployment area
7648174 i think it s amazing that she s still teaching
7648175 she brings a lot of real world knowledge to the classroom
7648176 the children say it must have been boring but i say no it was not boring boys and girls
7648177 children nowadays see and know too much way too early
7648178 august 25 t a t u became the faces of marc by marc jacob autumn winter 2008 campaign

7648181 we were all out here to greet the kids and help them find their way so there wasn t too much confusion
7648182 this is a great way to connect parents as partners in their children s education
7648183 it gives the parents the knowledge of what happens at school
7648184 now we have to get the buses out of here and that s just as big a hassle
7648185 it is important that all retailers use due diligence and pull products from their shelves
7648186 various ready to eat deli meat products recalled by maple leaf consumer foods
7648187 while these suspected cases are all positive for listeriosis it is important to note that genetic fingerprinting results are required before they can be linked to this specific outbreak so we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and the numbers of confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
7648188 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life to canadians who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest sympathies words cannot begin to express our sadness for your pain
7648189 this is the worst air disaster in recent years we have never faced such a tragedy

7648197 done everything it could to prevent an escalation of the conflict with georgia and to prevent bloodshed
7648198 many russians are hoping the pair putin medvedev will continue leading the country back towards superpower status
7648199 medvedev is a weakling we should have trampled on georgia and while we were at it taken over the crimea again
7648200 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7648201 subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7648202 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7648203 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7648204 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
7648205 this year it just happened to work out we were visiting relatives in albany and were on our way back so its perfect timing and we didnt want to miss anything on our way home

7648209 i want to thank secretary peake for accepting my invitation to come to dallas and joining me at the va hospital today
7648210 the staff at the dallas va has demonstrated they are committed to making significant improvements to the facility and the level of care provided i was pleased to see progress underway and will continue to closely monitor these enhancements
7648211 we also had the opportunity to meet with several local veterans organizations we heard from them directly on their priorities and concerns easier access to care for rural veterans remains a top priority for texas veterans they are also seeking improved and more affordable housing options to reduce the number of homeless veterans i reiterated my shared support for these priorities i have and will continue to work in the senate to improve housing education and health care benefits for veterans in texas and across the nation i also remain committed to seeking increased resources for research of the invisible wounds of war mental health conditions like post traumatic stress disorder depression and anxiety its critical we devote as much attention as possible to these conditions so we can provide our veterans with the tools they need to make a full recovery
7648212 today senator cornyn and i were able to see firsthand the quality healthcare our dallas veterans receive and the ongoing improvements we are making here
7648213 senator cornyn has been a tireless advocate for veterans and we will continue to move forward in providing the best services we can from health care to benefits for our brave men and women who served so honorably

7648219 its believed to be the largest raid of its kind in the entire history of ohio
7648220 it was approximately 6 000 square feet absolutely loaded with trademark counterfeit goods
7648221 every one of these items we found is very very low quality and people are paying a lot of money and getting very much ripped off
7648222 the broadening of the war from south ossetia to abkhazia took place without any provocation whatsoever which suggests there were plans to do it all along
7648223 russian planes were circling the village the whole village panicked
7648224 they just wanted all the people to flee so they could take it over
7648225 we dont see any problem with them living in abkhazia they are abkhazian citizens and protected by the law

7648232 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7648233 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7648234 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support
7648235 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable but im trying to say to them that even if they make a mistake i still think they are the best in the country
7648236 i would like to make it clear that springbok coach peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing and that of the south african rugby union presidents council and of the board of sa rugby pty ltd
7648237 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it
7648238 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7648239 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7648240 the first time he went at me i could see him coming at me and the second time i sort of backed away after referee lyndon bray told me to release the ball from the ruck and luckily for me i did because it sort of just glanced me but i wouldnt have liked to cop the full brunt
7648241 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in
7648242 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7648243 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age
7648244 theyre tired of being angry theyre tired of being lied to
7648245 i want to see how mccain and obama deal with each other
7648246 im tired of the politicians bringing sweet pork barrel deals
7648247 i know the problems as well as he does i want to know the fix
7648248 i talked with kiwanuka yesterday and he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do that was in the best interest of the team
7648249 the move was always to get the best most quality people on the field
7648250 and mathias accepted every job that we have offered and every task we have presented him with
7648251 obviously this isnt the way you want it to happen but it is an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys that has to step up and take advantage of it
7648252 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all and we just have to get on it and keep the ball moving
7648253 i am confident that i can get the job done
7648254 this is something i have been preparing for my entire life basically
7648255 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back in that room
7648256 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7648257 kiwi is the guy every year that regardless of what position we put him at hes going to produce and play to his ability
7648258 its just about getting comfortable he was working in a two point stance being up now hes got to put his hand back in the dirt i think in a week or two as time goes by and he gets comfortable gets used to it gets the rhythm back of playing defensive end hell be fine
7648259 were coached to do a certain thing and our defense works as one so getting one new guy in there shouldnt be a big difference i think the biggest change will be for kiwi
7648260 it wasnt as weird having him in there as it was not having osi thats the biggest transition for me osi and i have been playing on the right side together for over a year now so its going to be a learning curve but mathias was in the room we got here together we were in rookie minicamp together and a lot of times through our rookie season we played together so it wont be completely new for the most part our group has been together so for him to fill in not having to be the leader and look at guys like fred robbins and renaldo wynn we have plenty of guys in here that can lead
7648261 i did understand the complex deal with kiwi and when stray didnt come back and that he may move out to end
7648262 so i did understand that sam may be an option but i focused on the wil linebacker but i understand this is a business and im going to embrace it with open arms
7648263 im excited about it its something that i got seasoned at during training camp and played it in my past i just got to go out and turn up the level of production and play better for our defense i dont have to change anything with my body i just go out there and bang with tight ends im on the line more often and its less productive than weak side linebacker because you have to fly around making plays on the ball and youre more a d lineman at sam linebacker but we have an opportunity to get off the ball and make some plays as well
7648264 you never want to get an opportunity with one of your teammates getting injured but its an opportunity ive wanted and now its my chance to take it
7648265 its something ive done more than anything else and its something i am most comfortable with
7648266 i want to see as much action as i can
7648267 i took about 50 snaps last week which was good to just get back in the flow of playing and getting in game shape but against new england id like to play as much as i can to get oiled up even more
7648268 we just have to keep those guys healthy and hopefully we can go into week 1 through week 16 with the same guys
7648269 i dont want to be flip flopping linebackers you have to get that continuity you just want to get those guys in place let gerris know hes going to be the wil and danny clark the sam and let those guys focus on those positions that way guys can really get to their complete level of ability
7648270 i think gerris knows hes had several opportunities to become a starter hell be a starter this week and hopefully going into the season and he has to step it up and start filling those shoes of his and make a name for himself danny clark same way he came here to be a starter and now hes a starter you have to produce on the field and hopefully we can play well as a unit
7648271 obviously osi is a remarkable player and that really hurts us but it just means someone has to step up now
7648272 feeling sorry for yourself in this league never flies the dallas offensive line or the washington offensive line isnt going to feel sorry for us like we always say we are moving forward obviously it is a setback but if we feel sorry for ourselves that is when the real trouble starts i think it gives an opportunity to really rely on each other and put that concept of team first at the utmost right now
7648273 we lost three starters to broken legs last season so we know what kind of adversity injuries present when you lose a player like osi that means everybody else has to step up their game fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack as always well continue to research all of our options
7648274 there hasnt been any discussion that i have been involved in there
7648275 we are going to explore every option that is available and the last time that i talked with michael he had accepted his new challenge and was very happy about that and i have not spoken with him at all since the other nights game
7648276 when adversity strikes it is not the adversity it is how you react to it we have been a team that has done a good job with that and simply presented it is really up to each one of us to do our jobs a little bit better than we have been doing it we have talented football players we have people that can do the job we have to just step it up a notch we all have to come together i really believe that in a situation like this you become more dependent on each other than ever before so the team theme keeps pouring out of us at this time
7648277 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7648278 i forgot how tough it is to run routes when youre a little bit winded in the two minute drill even though i didnt go but a few plays its just good to get out there and run around again im happy i can go out there and run without any pain im basically trying to get into the best playing shape that i can and get my cardio up i hope i feel pretty good tomorrow
7648279 i did not expect to be starting at strong side linebacker said clark
7648280 i did understand the complex deal with kiwi and stray didnt come back and that he may move out to end so i did understand that sam may be an option but i focused on the wil linebacker i understand this is a business and im going to embrace it with open arms
7648281 oh im excited about it its something that i got seasoned at during training camp and i played it in the past i just got to go out and turn up the level of production and play better for our defense
7648282 yeah i just have to be in the over defense
7648283 thats when im lined up off the ball im lined up with ap and gerris or whoever may be out there i get to line up off the ball and still get to play downhill which is something that is one of my attributes its something i want to bring to our defense so i do want to play in the backfield most of the time
7648284 you never want to get an opportunity with one of your teammates getting injured but its an opportunity ive wanted and now its my chance to take it
7648285 i made a good amount of tackles i had a few mental errors just playing the middle linebacker spot which im not really used to but i felt pretty good out there
7648286 we just have to keep those guys healthy and hopefully we can go into week one through week 16 with the same guys
7648287 i dont want to be flip flopping linebackers you have to get that continuity weve already changed the starting linebacker group three or four times since training camp you just want to get those guys in place let gerris know hes going to be the wil and the sam and let those guys focus on those positions that way guys can really get to their complete level of ability
7648288 ill be out there every snap this season fighting along the way were just being very cautious and i understand being in year nine but the most important thing is to be ready sept 4th
7648289 yeah im feeling good real good its feeling real good i cant say its 100 but it is feeling great though
7648290 i think gerris knows hes had several opportunities to become a starter hell be a starter this week and hopefully going into the season and on so he has to step it up and start filling those shoes of his own and make a name for himself
7648291 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7648292 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7648293 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7648294 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7648295 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7648296 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7648297 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7648298 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7648299 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7648300 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7648301 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7648302 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7648303 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7648304 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
7648305 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7648306 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7648307 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system
7648308 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7648309 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7648310 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7648311 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7648312 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7648313 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind sen obama
7648314 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7648315 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7648316 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7648317 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7648318 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7648319 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve of this message
7648320 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7648321 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7648322 have been wonderful partners in working on the convention with us and we worked closely with them
7648323 hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that may come up more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure
7648324 when i initially got the news that biden was the vp choice i had mixed emotions
7648325 i was a little discouraged to hear that clinton had been overlooked
7648326 this convention i hope will bring out hillary and appreciate her for all of the work shes done especially for putting health care at the forefront
7648327 im going to vote for hillary clinton on the floor as provided by barack obamas agreement with senator clinton and then im going to support the democratic ticket with enthusiasm
7648328 we conducted a democratic process the person with the most delegates at the end of the day is the winner and i hope people will recognize that
7648329 will be small and will accrue mainly to those consumers who desire
7648330 were an industry with a net profit of just 1 to 2 of sales so any increase is going to have an effect on cost to consumers
7648331 but now we will go about implementation in as cost effective manner as possible
7648332 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7648333 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7648334 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7648335 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7648336 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7648337 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7648338 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7648339 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7648340 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7648341 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7648342 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7648343 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know

7648353 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7648354 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7648355 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
7648356 for us its another way to engage consumers with the brand and the approach in itself is very consistent with our brand dna its an opportunity to connect with consumers at their level because they are using devices anyway so we can bring product to them in unique way ideally if we engage with them and they enjoy gaming they will go to next level

7648382 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool

7648442 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7648443 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7648444 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7648445 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7648446 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7648447 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7648448 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7648449 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7648450 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7648451 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density

7648475 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7648476 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7648477 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7648478 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda

7648585 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7648586 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office

7648594 shouldnt ball boys be allowed required to wear disposal gloves
7648595 despite all the talk that we hear from the democatic party here in colorado about unity the democratic party is in fact divided
7648596 i believe the real magic of barack obama is to turn lifelong democrats into john mccain supporters overnight
7648597 even the vice presidential pick said what ive been saying for months
7648598 delaware sen joe biden said barack obama is not ready to be president yet
7648599 won millions of votes but isnt on his obamas ticket why for speaking the truth
7648600 on both sides it has been hard to find people with firsthand knowledge of deaths in a war that sparked the biggest crisis in russias relations with europe and the united states since the soviet union collapsed what no one disputes is that villages emptied quickly aid groups and georgian officials estimate that as many as 158 000 people have left their homes including 30 000 ethnic ossetians who went north to russia about 100 000 who fled south ossetia and the georgian city of gori went to tbilisi georgias capital and 22 000 to other towns
7648601 russia has hastened georgias march toward membership in nato by going to war with it over its breakaway province of south ossetia a senior u s diplomat said on saturday the 26 member alliance which already includes the three former soviet baltic states will convene in december to decide whether to grant georgia a road map to accession known as a membership action plan
7648602 france called a summit of european union leaders for next week to discuss the conflict in georgia reflecting growing frustration among western leaders as russia defies calls to withdraw all its troops from georgian territory
7648603 russian forces also continued to patrol the port city of poti in spite of western criticism that the russian military presence there violates a ceasefire agreement signed last week by the two sides
7648604 ukraine has become a hostage in the war waged by russia this has prompted ukrainian authorities and all of our countrys people including those living in the crimea to ponder the dangers emanating from the fact that the russian black sea fleet is based on our territory the tragic events in georgia also exposed the lack of effective preventive mechanisms by the united nations the organization for security and cooperation in europe and other international organizations ukraine favors a wider international representation in the peacekeeping force in the conflict area a new multilateral format mandated by the united nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe is the only way to guarantee security in the conflict zone
7648605 neither the west nor russia can gain anything from this instead common interests demand for a new era of cooperation
7648606 sure enough a return to russian imperialistic style politics towards its neighbors is not acceptable
7648607 the wests answer to this must not be shortsighted prestige politics to conceal the its own weakness
7648608 the eu has established itself as the main diplomatic broker in the conflict between russia and georgia it should use this position to help forge a positive peace from a war which threatens the foundations of the european security order russia has used its conflict with georgia to display its military power reclaim a sphere of influence and frighten its neighbors rather than looking for punitive measures the eu should respond to russias demonstration of force with much stronger engagement for democracy prosperity and security in the broader region keeping tough measures towards moscow on the table if russia resists
7648609 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7648610 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7648611 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7648612 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7648613 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7648614 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7648615 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7648616 the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace is pleased to endorse the 1st world congress on interventional therapies for type 2 diabetes
7648617 aace recognizes the need for interventions that are proven to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes aace looks forward to participating in this very important scientific meeting which will critically examine the potential role for surgery in treating type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders
7648618 i am excited about the collaboration between endocrinologists and surgeons
7648619 together along with other leading experts in diabetes and public health the congress will examine the emerging role of surgery not only as a therapy for type 2 diabetes but as a means to shed light on the causes of the disease the lessons we are already learning from studying gastrointestinal surgery have tremendous implications for the same future of medical therapies of diabetes
7648620 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future
7648621 teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
7648622 teasing out the agents responsible for the beneficial effects of gastrointestinal surgery on diabetes may lead to new discoveries and provide targets for new medications or even less invasive interventional therapies

7648630 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7648631 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial

7648702 its different i told my people i wanted the rally after we won the championship it just gives me extra incentive to go out and play and finish no 1
7648703 hes different hes athletic can really defend multiple guard spots phoenix was starting to use him at the one thats where hell be unique he might have a chance to catch on in the league even he was just at the two just from his defensive ability
7648704 if we feel like he can handle the point offensively then we feel like we got something there

7648710 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7648714 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying to do some new material and some writing i dont know what it will be but it will be something at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material when i get there i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing

7648716 han pasado 20 meses desde que hicimos las obras y todav a no nos pagan
7648717 la inquietud planteada por los proveedores y le anunciamos que se la bamos a transmitir al ministro
7648718 la mayor a son empresas que est n trabajando desde hace mucho tiempo en la obra p blica no solo en el gobierno sino tambi n en el municipio
7648719 la mayor a de los expedientes tienen alg n tipo de observaci n administrativa o t cnica del tribunal de cuentas
7648720 nos asegur que est n abocados intentando dar alg n tipo de soluci n a este problema que existe desde hace 14 meses y es un tiempo prudencial para generar definiciones sobre el tema y que se les cancele a los que est n en condiciones y que a los restantes se le ofrezca la posibilidad de implementar otro mecanismo para recuperar la inversi n hecha
7648721 la predisposici n del concejo deliberante para colaborar y transmitir las inquietudes que puedan tener los vecinos
7648722 porque si contin an los despidos masivos se va a generar un conflicto social importante
7648723 ya no esta en las manos de los concejales la decisi n de la legislatura de sancionar la ley de emergencia laboral o no
7648724 pude percibir la voluntad de los cuatro bloques pol ticos de avanzar sobre este tema
7648725 es una discusi n entre los trabajadores y el sector privado y el gobierno oficia de mediador a trav s del ministerio de trabajo
7648726 se encauce el conflicto quiz s ser a innecesaria una ley de estas caracter sticas
7648727 the perception is you conspired somehow to talk to people who signed the protest petition to convince them to get off
7648728 did you specifically target people who signed the protest petition did you coordinate in any way with the activities of the petitioners
7648729 why the big announcement why now came out of nowhere
7648730 if the town needs further review and more detailed plans why get the residents involved and cause more unease and confusion
7648731 even after being advised by the town attorney assessor etc about the need for the state to change the law the likes of the ts town supervisor and his deputy decided to place their own resolutions on the agenda so once the town board meeting had started the ts gave a half hearted apology to the crowd and stated that he never attended sic it to affect existing condo owners
7648732 shelly said she did speak to four of the people whose names were on the petition voting
7648733 interestingly the four people she spoke with did remove their names from the petition sheets
7648734 shelly schratz should be removed from office if she refuses to resign
7648735 charlar sobre temas presupuestarios que tienen que ver con la definici n de objetivos claros y comunes
7648736 motiv a la gobernadora a organizar una serie de conversaciones
7648737 sta es la primera con miembros del poder judicial parte del poder legislativo el tribunal de cuentas y la fiscal a de estado
7648738 la necesidad de trabajar mancomunadamente ante una situaci n que sigue siendo compleja y que va a seguir siendo as
7648739 est reflejado en el proyecto que se va a enviar los pr ximos d as a la legislatura
7648740 el canal de dialogo abierto y la intenci n de seguir con esta serie de conversaciones integrando a los tres poderes y a los organismos de control
7648741 lo recibieron bien porque se mostraron conformes y deseosos de participar aportando incluso algunas ideas y algunos temas orientados a definiciones globales de la situaci n provincial
7648742 the arrival of a major new talent on the literary scene
7648743 at first i said no to oliver i gave him names of other actors i was afraid to do it some of these comedians out there they do a carbon copy w that is hilarious for fifteen seconds then you ask whats the next joke
7648744 hey dont you think its cheaper to buy 2 bags of

7648746 justin arrived in a separate car and met her inside
7648747 he was saying how excited he was to be back in palm springs to see jessicas film
7648748 before heading into the theater several of the marines from the nearby base were volunteering and asked jessica to pose in a photo
7648749 with communication and cell phones this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now you are announced at the district level and cell phones go wild so by the time you go to the capital if you have changed the figures they will know and you will be caught out
7648750 internet provides groups in society with means to communicate organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government but only a tiny percentage of african populations have access to internet
7648751 during the 2006 local government elections in senegal radio sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw i remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station this was reported live as it was happening
7648752 parallel reporting was important in zimbabwe it kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result
7648753 all of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating
7648754 the more transparency and the more information that can be circulated outside the hands of government is a good thing but the other side of that is that a lot of misinformation can get out that way also
7648755 it doesnt mean anything unless you have all of the means of verifying the results if you have a ruling authoritarian regime which is determined to cheat they will do it
7648756 africans have been able to organize without technology freedom of association the right to organize autonomous organizations and function freely is more important than access to new technology in fostering democracy
7648757 that said new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments between civil society organizations and the public informed citizens are essential to good functioning of democracies
7648758 authoritarian regimes want to control and monopolize the flow of information african authoritarian regimes dont have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information
7648759 new technology is not a panacea but it can speed up processes of democratization and should be encouraged

7648770 you would have to believe she somehow had some special innate knowledge to know what was going on inside marriel
7648771 the loss does not dictate that a parent be a medical expert
7648772 now how are we going to head that off at the pass well well have danielle found guilty of something

7648774 and he now rests in the arms of the angels
7648775 i am really excited about offering faux casted glass to our clients
7648776 the process is very unique it has a relief feel to it and the design can be as intricate or as simple as you desire the design is literally brought to life by using edged lighting which causes the design to radiate from within
7648777 in each media market the presidential race is too close to call
7648778 they are afraid they are going to let osama bin laden in sometimes they are less than pleasant
7648779 it is in the interest of both candidates to go after these voters hook line and sinker
7648780 it tasted absolutely awful but i felt so grown up so i bought my first pack
7648781 my life began to revolve around smoking i couldnt wait to have a cigarette a mother of one of my friends would let us smoke at her house so that is where we spent most of our time
7648782 i remember one of my best guy friends telling me you could take the most attractive woman in the world and put a cigarette in her hand and she would be completely undesirable
7648783 after i gave birth to my daughter i came home from the hospital and began smoking
7648784 i was so paranoid about secondhand smoke i would wear a smoking jacket so i would not expose her to my smelly body when i held her
7648785 i smoked my last cigarette on my 35th birthday it was the hardest thing i have ever done in my life the monday after i quit was pretty non eventful by tuesday i was an emotional mess i was pacing the street crying to my doctor that i couldnt take it anymore
7648786 immediately following the conversation i broke down in front of my children
7648787 i couldnt be with my friends anymore especially my smoking friends
7648788 i eventually called my doctor again and she helped me to realize that although my physical addiction had passed my emotional withdrawal was taking a lot longer
7648789 she started me on a low dose of an anti depressant said she didnt think i would need it long term just until i regained my ability to be my normal social self
7648790 i am a very strong independent woman and i really had to reach out admit my weakness and ask for help this was no easy task but very humbling i had many conversations with my kids during this time explaining to them the problems i had quitting and why they should never pick up smoking i even joked that you could have put me in a cage inside any junior high school in america during my week of withdrawal and you would never have another smoker in that school
7648791 its amazing how much easier aerobic exercise is without a cigarette in my hand
7648792 im enjoying sitting down with my kids after dinner instead of running to the garage to smoke
7648793 im enjoying not having to drive around the block twice so i can get a cigarette finished before i go back to work i enjoy pulling a suit out of my closet and not having to douse it in febreeze every morning i enjoy so many things and now i get to be around longer to enjoy even more
7648794 someday i hope to have grandkids and i want to be able to take them golfing and boating and fishing and not have to wear an oxygen mask to accomplish it one of the best things i have ever done in my life is quit smoking i am not an anti smoking fanatic im not going to nag break your cigarettes or feign coughing attacks however i am a very happy non smoker and i challenge every one of you who does smoke to make this life altering change
7648795 just for pure education purposes and really to get a better understanding of the process
7648796 everyone automatically thinks that their taxes are going to go up
7648797 theres a lot of fear and anxiety when anyone hears reassessment so thats an issue that we address
7648798 i think it varies from city to city on how many kids they take each variation has some kids in it it can be anywhere from 20 to 60 i think
7648799 the dancer we selected to work with the children is a very important soloist in the company and got high grades in school for dance she is planning 10 years ahead of time to make a career in teaching
7648800 even from simple things like how important warming up is whether its doing the bar or taking a class professionals will warm up for an hour things that are pretty standard when it comes to high level dancing and kids up here need to see that
7648801 the advanced dancers here get a real taste of what its like to be in a professional company
7648802 the thing is that people consider us pingpong which is a name put on it by parker brothers but in every other country its a top sport
7648803 people play this pitter patter game in the basement and get fed up if they came out and gave us a try they would really enjoy it a lot more
7648804 i didnt know about the organized kind until yvonne brought a club to howard county
7648805 i started playing in tournaments and became involved in organized playing
7648806 depending on who you beat or lose to it affects your ratings
7648807 you dont have to be tough and you dont have to be big to play this
7648808 people think its kind of a trivial game and dont consider it a sport but table tennis athletes were the most aerobically fit
7648809 if you want to get super good you have to do drills and practices and really move around a lot
7648810 i think that its a really good way for the survivors to express themselves its a way of telling their experiences to the community that might not be able to completely empathize with the survivors
7648811 ive seen photos of the displays some of them are really large and quite impressive
7648812 i think people will be shocked when they see it
7648813 i think it always has been exclusive to women because the nature of it typically affects females more as a victim but any person who is affected by it can be involved in making a shirt
7648814 i think the biggest thing is the anxiety of going from the oldest to the youngest
7648815 a lot of students are working two or three part time jobs trying to pay for school and balancing school and a social life
7648816 frequently the area that a lot of students are a lot more comfortable in giving up is sleep
7648817 the classes themselves they tend to be harder they have different levels of expectations more responsibility

7648859 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7648860 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7648861 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7648862 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations

7648876 our way of life is likely to be more fundamentally transformed in the next several decades than in the previous one thousand years tens of thousands of novel transgenic bacteria viruses plants and animals could be released into the earths ecosystems some of those releases however could wreak havoc with the planets biospheres
7648877 genetic engineering is often justified as a human technology one that feeds more people with better food nothing could be further from the truth with very few exceptions the whole point of genetic engineering is to increase sales of chemicals and bio engineered products to dependent farmers

7648888 au erdem h tte viel mehr passieren k nnen ein wunder dass niemand querschnittsgel hmt ist
7648889 ich musste f r eine szene 13 14 mal vom lkw springen immer auf granitboden in hollywood gibts matten zum abfedern ich habe mir dabei den fu gebrochen konnte sechs wochen nicht laufen
7648890 mit blessuren muss man eben rechnen die dreharbeiten waren ein erlebnis
7648891 in jedem interview habe ich nachdenken m ssen wann ich angeblich auf die welt gekommen bin
7648892 sie kam mit einer kleinen zeichnung wo sie aufgemalt hat was sie gerne m chte
7648893 madonna hat anderthalb stunden davon ist die h lfte der zeit f r make up die andere zeit f r die haare
7648894 kritik bleibt intern wer sich nicht daran h lt der bekommt probleme
7648895 f r mich und den rest des teams war es schon verwunderlich dass joe nicht gespielt hat
7648896 ebert wird einer einrichtung einen geldbetrag zur verf gung stellen den trainer zu kritisieren das dulden wir nicht und da werden wir auch rigoros gegen vorgehen
7648897 ich habe mir alle filme angeschaut extra einen dvd player gekauft ich habe einen filmabend mit freunden organisiert teilweise war richtig schwere kost dabei es ging viel um den tod
7648898 aber dazu h tte geh rt dass sie was zum verbleib des geldes sagen
7648899 in der formel 1 gen gend aber die fahrer f r 2009 sind ein thema das ich nicht weiter kommentiere
7648900 ich habe alles probiert aber es ging nichts das war eines der schlimmsten rennen f r mich
7648901 wenn er noch einen test haben will kriegt er einen er hat ja schon einen bekommen wenn wir mehr bier trinken sollen machen wir das auch das haben wir schon getan
7648902 er kannte nicht nur bmw sondern auch das sauber team daher war er der perfekte mann f r den beginn des neuen teams
7648903 mark ist in keinster weise ein problem es ist nicht einfach f r ihn man wartet nur auf ein foul von ihm
7648904 wenn ein anderer spieler so etwas macht wird weitergespielt es kann sein dass ich unter besonderer beobachtung stehe
7648905 es ist ein vorteil dass die bayern noch probleme haben das m ssen wir ausnutzen so ein auftritt wie beim letzten saisonfinale wird es nicht mehr geben
7648906 das volksbegehren stellt einen gewichtigen und nachhaltigen eingriff in die haushaltshoheit des parlaments dar
7648907 wir sind sehr zuversichtlich dass wir vor gericht einen erfolg erzielen werden
7648908 leidtragende sind die kinder denn bis das gericht entscheidet kann es sechs monate oder l nger dauern
7648909 deshalb m ssen sich jetzt dringend alle beteiligten an einen tisch setzen und nach einer l sung suchen
7648910 das ist eine schlechte entscheidung des senats offensichtlich hat rot rot ein verkrampftes verh ltnis zu volksbegehren das wurde auch schon beim flughafen tempelhof deutlich
7648911 sie sagte sie habe die weste an wolle den anschlag aber nicht ver ben
7648912 wir haben beschwerden erhalten und pr fen jetzt ob frau moss f r die zelte eine baugenehmigung einholen muss
7648913 christiane war immer schon eine hungerlatte wenn wir zum kinderarzt gegangen sind dann hat die rztin immer gefragt ob sie es alleine auf die liege schafft schon als kind war sie anf llig f r krankheiten bei den kleinsten erk ltungen bekam sie nasenbluten erbrechen fieber
7648914 da hat sie dann gesagt das liege am lehrer mit dem komme sie nicht klar
7648915 ich habe christiane nachmittags auf der stra e mit einem gleichaltrigen jungen getroffen
7648916 ich bin dann meistens noch hinterher gegangen und habe gesagt na war es sch n heute was habt ihr gemacht oft sagte sie dann sie sei m de und w rde sich hinlegen da habe ich mir nichts weiter bei gedacht sie war immer noch das liebe m dchen das ich kannte
7648917 aber rauchen war ja erlaubt im haus der mitte ich dachte sie ist da gut aufgehoben
7648918 ich habe nicht mit ihr geschimpft weil ich immer so ein schlechtes gewissen hatte ich h tte mal strenger sein sollen aber das widerstrebte mir den ganzen tag nicht f r meine kinder da sein zu k nnen und sie dann auch noch anzumeckern
7648919 ich hatte nicht den eindruck dass sie sich von mir wegentwickelt hat
7648920 ich habe immer nur gesagt ich erkundige mich ob du bei kessi warst
7648921 ich h tte durchaus mal bei ihrer mutter anfragen k nnen ich habe sie offenbar nicht gen gend kontrolliert das war ein fehler
7648922 ich habe eine blinddarmreizung mir tut der bauch so weh ihr ist immer etwas eingefallen und da macht man sich auch etwas vor weil man lieber m chte dass alles in ordnung ist
7648923 ich fragte sie wo hast du denn das geld her
7648924 ich hatte die vermutung dass sie auf den strich geht
7648925 ich sagte erstens bist du viel zu jung daf r zweitens kann ich die 200 mark daf r nicht aufbringen abends kam sie trotzdem mit den stiefeln nach hause ihre erkl rung sie kennt da jemanden in dem laden der hat sie ihr probeweise ausgeliehen
7648926 da fiel mir auf dass sie die badezimmert r abgeschlossen hatte das war bei uns berhaupt nicht blich
7648927 und dann ffnete sie und rannte an mir vorbei zuerst habe ich das angesengte papier gesehen dann den verkohlten l ffel da hat es mich wie ein blitzschlag getroffen ich war nicht mehr in der lage berhaupt einen klaren gedanken zu fassen mein kopf dr hnte ich zitterte am ganzen leib stand v llig neben mir eine welt ist in diesem moment zusammengebrochen dann schrie ich sie an christiane hast du dir heroin gespritzt ich bog ihr mit gewalt die arme auseinander sah die einstiche da gab sie es zu ich dachte in diesem moment ich muss sterben

7648929 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7648930 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7648931 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7648932 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7648933 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7648934 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7648935 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7648936 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7648937 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7648938 perhaps the most convincing rationale is one we have been espousing that the market has reached a familiar impasse in terms of the increasingly compelling arguments on both sides of the market
7648939 technicals have a consolidative look and there is no fresh fundamental news of any consequence to move the markets
7648940 tests were completed over the weekend the pipeline is back in service
7648941 the tanks at ceyhan have been filled and petrol exports can recommence
7648942 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7648943 while this implies some stability in demand the headwinds of tighter lending standards and rising unemployment suggest that a recovery in home sales in 2008 remains a challenge
7648944 with the ongoing weakness in the eurozone we may see another push lower to revisit last weeks low
7648945 as of late the differences in the data between the us and the rest of the world seems to be leaning in the dollars favour and with the shifting global rate expectations the dollar may be poised for another broader rally
7648946 the us dollar has had a brisk recovery off its most recent low if the dollar rally is going to continue there has to be confidence that the backing of the currency is sound
7648947 constantly passing out funds to cover every distressed situation could weaken confidence in the dollar which quickly would be manifested in a rebound in energy prices as well as prices for many other commodities

7648979 unfortunately the economy continues to stagger and we must make this painful choice of further reducing expenses and changing business practices
7648980 youre affecting peoples lives hopefully its for the good of all those who remain
7648981 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look you gotta get this done
7648982 la s curit a t renforc e dans et autour du site de construction plus de 4 000 policiers ont t d ploy s
7648983 nous nous sommes retrouv s confront s plus de difficult s que pr vu essentiellement cause du mauvais tat des chantillons dadn et cela ralentit les travaux
7648984 il faut respecter deux imp ratifs la c l rit car nous sommes conscients de ce quil se passe de la douleur de la souffrance

7648986 terrible wrenching events are just over the horizon i do not know what they are but if i run i sense that i will be engulfed by them
7648987 robert kennedy and i understand each other and will support each other no matter who is nominated
7648988 if mccarthy remains in the race he will plague both of us all the way to chicago
7648989 youre not going to hold a gun to our heads youre forgetting this is a minority parliament the people didnt give you a free pass
7648990 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7648991 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state
7648992 and were not going to rest until you are stopped
7648993 what message does that send when you try to recruit other informants
7648994 detailed construction plans for nuclear weapons for gas ultracentrifuges for the enrichment of weapons grade uranium as well as for guided missile delivery systems
7648995 under all circumstances this information was not to reach the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
7648996 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7648997 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7648998 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7648999 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case
7649000 it is impossible to make any schedule since the case is in many aspects extraordinary
7649001 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7649002 hurt by having a good candidate we were so galvanized against bush in 2004 that every outside group went nuts threw everything we had at the republicans and we almost came up with the win despite a less inspiring candidate this year the spirit of 2004 has been lost obama made the mistake of defunding the outside groups and weve become complacent to an extent
7649003 can be a place for people to earn money not spend money we need collective action for green citizenship to create the jobs of the future in a green new deal as long as carbon is free were never going to move forward
7649004 this is about laws not gizmos technology cannot be the savior this has to be a bottom up inside outside and a top down strategy if the feds are mia human life will be mia in the future
7649005 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7649006 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7649007 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7649008 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7649009 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7649010 2006 sports title had achievements that were practically handed to the player
7649011 are the ones that are getting the credit for the money
7649012 interest in a limited partnership established to purchase real estate
7649013 the need for respect for the archaeological historical cultural and religious heritage of iraq and for the continued protection of archaeological historical cultural and religious sites museums libraries and monuments
7649014 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7649015 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
7649016 then you use less time shopping less time driving less aggravation overall you would spend less money
7649017 thats been too long ago for me to remember but i know whats kept me in it for 35 years is i enjoy working with the students and i want them to take something from me that they can keep with them always
7649018 its very difficult to do what we do but teachers are very passionate people and we hang in there even when its tough
7649019 i finally decided to take the plunge and i did it
7649020 we find that many of our children dont dream they are limited to their immediate exposure and so i want to develop that and i want them to know that they can anything they want to do
7649021 you have to believe in your students and you have to make them believe in themselves my goal is to play on those strengths and develop those weaknesses and to see them become successful
7649022 last night we came back downtown and this block of princess was pitch dark and it was a little eerie walking down the street in total darkness
7649023 a complete source for national high school sports and lifestyle coverage
7649024 it appears that the case was originally closed because they had done the investigation and concluded that there was no sign of forced entry you look at the crime scene you look at photos of the house you dont see any kinds of struggle
7649025 madonnas apparent swipe at mccain came during a performance of the song
7649026 i know our fans are anxious for the start of another school year and football season
7649027 we want ou to be well represented this friday when college fans all across the nation show their true colors
7649028 if you can find 3 i forget the exact figure that would help me greatly please revise your proposal and add less 3 discount negotiated with fred smith of procurement and resubmit and i will raise the po immediately
7649029 i think the reason i voted for computerland was that
7649030 if you want to persuade me you must think my thoughts feel my feelings and speak my words
7649031 we trained hard but it seemed like everytime we began to form into effective teams we were re organized i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by re organising and what a wonderful method it is for giving the illusion of progress while in reality causing confusion inefficiency and demoralisation

7649039 al momento ci sono dei discorsi con il napoli di collaborazione e di confronto vedremo se nei prossimi giorni si concretizzer qualcosa
7649040 if we just focus on the religious element adding biden to the democratic ticket was an extremely smart move
7649041 biden has ties in a very important swing state pennsylvania where catholics are the biggest constituency whose votes are up for grabs
7649042 there is a broader group of catholics who have pro life sympathies but who dont vote exclusively on that issue and in that case biden may be an appealing candidate
7649043 and the fact that he has opposed late term abortions gives him some talking points which obama doesnt have
7649044 where the catholic vote could make a real difference are florida ohio and louisiana
7649045 physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who they believed expected them although they correctly identified only about 1 in 4 of those patients

7649060 none of that will happen if mccain is in the white house
7649061 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with mccain
7649062 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7649063 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7649064 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7649065 i have received treatments from steven sonmore for over ten years i have tried quite a few acupuncturists and have not found anyone as good as steven i have yet to get the results from others that i can get from stevens treatments he treats me for lower back pain this is where his combination of acupuncture and oriental massage work really compliments his treatments he also has treated me for irregular menstrual cycles i now have 3 children and another on the way i also receive treatments from him while im pregnant and feel completely comfortable and confident with steven i cant speak more highly of him steven sonmore is the best
7649066 acupuncture is a real blessing for me i suffered from chronic neck shoulder and lower back pain stevens expert care relived me of all of my pain and now i am free of the nagging pains that limited my lifes activities i highly recommend steven as an acupuncturist
7649067 for over 5 years i have suffered from chronic neck and shoulder pain
7649068 i have a recurring problem with swelling above my knees
7649069 i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the spring of 1995 i have had tingling and numbness in my right hand and pain in both of my calves i also have had very blurred vision optic neuritis i had to use a walker at the health club to get around my sister an acupuncturist in california recommended that i find an acupuncturist that is an advanced balance method practitioner after receiving acupuncture twice a week from steven sonmore i no longer have any numbness or tingling in my right hand the pain in my calves has improved i also have seen improvements in my vision when nothing else has worked i have not used my walker for months steven has also helped me with herbs that have helped with constipation and headaches
7649070 after open heart surgery i began acupuncture with targeted massage steven immediately proved himself at problem solving areas of pain and inflammation not only from the surgery itself but also with other over worked areas and joints i had difficulties with for years
7649071 i found steven sonmore when searching for alternative mental health and began bringing my 23 year old daughter to him about 2 months ago after trying many different antipsychotic medicines to treat her for symptoms of schizoaffective disorder with the antipsychotic medicines she experienced many problems like severe weight gain interrupted menstruation increased blood pressure fast heart rate confusion extreme tiredness slowed thinking and blurred vision none of these medications cured the symptoms that had been upsetting her daily
7649072 since she started acupuncture treatment with steven she has become able to focus remain calm and tolerate the voices she heard without becoming upset with the twice weekly acupuncture treatment and chinese herbs she has been able once again to tolerate going out in public settings like the mall or unfamiliar restaurants for the first time since becoming ill four years ago we cant begin to express our gratitude for her improvement she is in a recovery process and has now gone off all her antipsychotic medication without any worsening of the voices in fact she now considers the voices not bothersome we look forward to continued improvement in her functioning and well being as she is now no longer experiencing the side effects of the antipsychotic medications we just wish we would have tried the acupuncture before going through four years of medication trials
7649073 since ive been seeing you for acupuncture treatments i have a better grasp on how emotions and the body interact
7649074 i had no idea that acupuncture could be so effective for a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis that has the potential to be so devastating
7649075 i want to thank you for all the help you have given me with my allergies and asthma
7649076 i go and see my physician once a year and he gives me two different breathing tests each of these have shown a significant improvement in lung capacity and the speed with which my breath flows as a person gets older the test results usually go in the opposite direction

7649104 bush wanted to remove saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and wmd weapons of mass destruction but the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
7649105 saddam was not threatening his neighbours and his wmd capability was less than that of libya north korea or iran

7649110 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7649111 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7649112 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it

7649139 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7649140 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7649141 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7649142 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7649143 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7649144 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7649145 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7649146 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7649147 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7649148 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7649149 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7649150 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7649151 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7649152 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7649153 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7649154 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7649155 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7649156 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7649157 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7649158 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7649159 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7649160 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7649161 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7649162 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7649163 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7649164 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7649165 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7649166 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7649167 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7649168 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7649169 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7649170 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
7649171 i would love nothing more than for cher to play catwoman shed be great shes one of the most extraordinary women anyone could ever meet but i havent received any phone call about this and hadn t even heard about it i think ill call chris nolan and find out whats going on
7649172 if you were on a desert island and running out of food
7649173 would you blow it all on one big party or stretch the food without telling the others
7649174 id stretch the soup until all i had was a pot of hot water
7649175 its been a really nice experience we already have our little inside jokes
7649176 it is what it is its fine no crazy dramas going on
7649177 its not a mom and dad who are home eating bon bons its a couple whos fucking well clear the kitchen so fast you dont know what to do with yourself
7649178 my kids are by no means ready to watch this 90210
7649179 im really sad that it hasnt happened yet and im very hopeful that it will happen
7649180 movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead
7649181 senator obama so and again im im not going to prolong this but i just want to be clear because i think this was the source of the objections of the medical society as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved is that correct
7649182 attraverso i giochi il mondo ha imparato qualcosa sulla cina e la cina ha imparato qualcosa sul mondo cari atleti ci avete mostrato cosa sia lo spirito olimpico che vive nellabbraccio di atleti di paesi rivali dichiaro chiusi i giochi di pechino e invito i giovani del mondo a riunirsi fra quattro anni a londra
7649183 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7649184 all teams have three or four goalkeepers and every goalkeeper tries to be the best i am ready for this challenge and it is normal
7649185 if i play for hearts i have a chance to go back into the national team but i have to be playing for the team
7649186 tiago is a wonderful lad an exemplary professional and if he remains i would happily accept it
7649187 september is a few days away thankfully and the transfer window will close
7649188 has he asked to speak to me he hasnt spoken to me about these things he talks with the club about it
7649189 i dont know where the hell we can put it
7649190 what we are seeing is everyone has a computer when they come here
7649191 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7649192 it is unfortunate that warner bros has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7649193 about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
7649194 if you think youre outclassed you are youve got to think high to rise youve got to be sure of yourself before you can win the prize
7649195 at americans request we set up various mechanisms to block voice calls obviously someone found a way around them
7649196 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7649197 shes on her way to the little country of georgia
7649198 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7649199 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7649200 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7649201 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7649202 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7649203 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7649204 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7649205 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7649206 we had a wonderful time together first in boston and then later on in baltimore
7649207 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business
7649208 our goal with these new mobile services is to give quickbooks online users the edge they need to compete and manage their busy lives by keeping tabs on their business even when they are out of the office
7649209 given the virtual nature of our interactions iphone support helps us be more productive
7649210 while waiting for an appointment i was able to check quickbooks online using my iphone to look up parents with open balances and send them an e mail reminder to pay their bill
7649211 generally we are seeing greater penetration of smartphone users in the united states people who have smartphones do a lot more on the mobile web
7649212 banks are becoming more aggressive launching mobile access to their services so there is a demand for a service like quickbooks online for mobile
7649213 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7649214 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7649215 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket
7649216 these kids dont have 200 or 300 dollars to spend on a phone although theyd like to the blitz is cool enough that you dont have to be branded as the person using the cheap phone in school
7649217 the blitz looks like a nice addition to the lineup and really optimized in a way that this demographic uses their devices where messaging and music is as important as phone calls
7649218 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7649219 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7649220 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7649221 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
7649222 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
7649223 elsewhere featuring music by whom else chopin though it was choreographed by fokine in various stages around the turn of the 19th 20th century and looks very old fashioned it was actually one of the first modern ballets in that it had no plot
7649224 failures are only seen in a small percentage of all the chips
7649225 our competition has built a nice product but the nice things that people write about their product is that its well priced
7649226 its pretty discernible certainly desktop standalone graphics theyve seen improvement there
7649227 small incremental gains by ati more like onesy twosy were not talking about 10 point share shifts
7649228 the amd mobile processor business was not as strong as it probably could have been if amd mobile cpus dont sell neither do the nvidia mobile chipsets
7649229 hes an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country
7649230 the u s military must remain apolitical at all times and in all ways
7649231 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7649232 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7649233 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7649234 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7649235 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7649236 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7649237 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7649238 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7649239 you end up with project teams that are hugely inconsistent you might have a good team in place but a month later three quarters of the team has transitioned
7649240 only when executed well can it pull out hundreds of millions in cost and transform organizations
7649241 there was one indian fellow no one could understand over the phone it took us months to figure out what he was saying
7649242 when we hit the send button there was no code done by the previous shift the entire time they were at work
7649243 all our progress schedules were behind its a domino effect with everyone playing catch up
7649244 we underestimated the loss of knowledge that would take place during the transition
7649245 we were trying to get as much work as possible over to the taiwan manufacturer with the goal to get the cost for these products down as low as possible
7649246 these execs were being evaluated on cost not on the quality of the brand
7649247 this glamour of new product will perfectly fit to your daily life from any of locations
7649248 the main hp branding people had no idea was going on
7649249 all of that knowledge got left in the u s
7649250 an amazingly large amount of costs had to be reconciled
7649251 the contract was executed from a business perspective where it looked great but not enough thought was given to how to programmatically move to the new environment
7649252 i came in and checked e mail no e mail no web site they had simply turned it off it was all gone
7649253 functionality and community features didnt mesh properly and the design wasnt what we were looking for
7649254 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7649255 we wanted to reach out to the best folks in the business on what wed like to see as a forward looking technology strategy on everything from how to get more people engaged to information and data security
7649256 the tac has been a way for us to pull best practices from the private and public sectors
7649257 we built a brand new network because the network in place at the pepsi center could not handle the demand
7649258 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7649259 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7649260 as an example dnccs staff will be able to move among venue locations like invesco field and the hyatt hotel at the convention center with their cisco ip phones as they relocate depending on their changing functions
7649261 we are taking all of the steps that people would expect us to take
7649262 but were not going to talk a lot about them
7649263 weve added firewalls in place and weve got equipment in place to capture any kind of attacks
7649264 republicans dont protest they just go out and get jobs
7649265 wah i wasnt born rich someone should help me because im too lazy to buckle down and do it myself
7649266 with the explosion of the mac audience studios no longer have the luxury of releasing new
7649267 where the problem has been is that the existing click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank dvd authoring
7649268 the truth is i dont even know what steps ill do sometimes something new comes out of me and i dont even know where it came from
7649269 the only thing you can do to practice is to go out dancing since salon tango is improvised
7649270 salon tango is what people dance in the milongas dance halls its not very structured its more about the embrace its more musical with good taste elegance pauses not just technique and speed
7649271 weve been working on our choreography for three months our strength is the feeling we put into it we love to dance and that shows beyond the technique
7649272 the change has been really hard for me theres a huge difference between improvising and putting a choreography together its hard to improvise to connect as a couple
7649273 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7649274 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of president bushs failed policies
7649275 i am looking forward to being at the white house when president obama signs quality affordable health care for every american
7649276 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7649277 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of president bushs failed policies
7649278 i am looking forward to being at the white house when president obama signs quality affordable health care for every american
7649279 time and again governor rendell has publicly denied pennsylvanias health care delivery crisis exists in spite of the fact that patients have died due to the commonwealths loss of trauma care services and mothers and their unborn babies have lost access to delivery room services throughout philadelphia and beyond
7649280 governor rendells allegiance to special interests representing personal injury lawyers in spite of his own constituents loss of critical medical care is abhorrent
7649281 philadelphia holds the distinction of being home to some of americas best medical teaching colleges yet it cannot keep physicians in the state
7649282 in the past decade fourteen philadelphia area maternity units have closed leaving hundreds of mothers and babies in the heavily populated northeast quadrant in grave danger
7649283 coming from countries like canada and britain the authors have the ability to appreciate coming second or third even the necessity of it there is true glory in silver and bronze not if you are a citizen of china unless you achieve gold medal ranking your accomplishments will disappear along with hundreds of thousands of other second and third place finishers on chinese television if you win on a live broadcast you are certain to be replayed over and over if you or your team loses a terse three sentences on the evenings sports program will be all the glory you will receive an example of the obsession with coming first was seen after the 2004 athens olympics when only gold medal winners from mainland china were allowed the grace of celebrating their achievements in front of politicians and the public in hong kong silver and bronze medal winners had to be content with the warmth of family congratulations at home out of the limelight only mere fractions of distance and milliseconds of time separate winners from losers but in china the gulf between winners and loser is physical spiritual and huge
7649284 for china coming first in major international competitions is almost a matter of life and death and is comparable to a major military campaign
7649285 battle preparations for the 2008 olympic games are in a grave state to the outside we must display humble troops and keep a low profile but inwardly we must plant grand ambition to scale great heights and there can be absolutely no slackening
7649286 tell her i will be the father of her child
7649287 do you know what they should have at the olympics dog fighting and then the losing dogs theyll eat them
7649288 for the preliminaries you could have dmxs dogs go up against michael vicks dogs
7649289 because its china and they eat dog there because its china

7649291 flashpoint has hit its mark with north american audiences and remained competitive even during the olympics
7649292 viewers have embraced flashpoint and we are answering their call for more the cast and creative team have delivered a series that not only entertains with high intensity drama but with heart as well
7649293 were excited that canadian audiences have responded with such enthusiasm to flashpoints stories of humanity and adrenaline
7649294 were extremely proud to have this opportunity to bring more of our homegrown stories to viewers in canada and around the world
7649295 commodity prices will remain high and volatile and market turbulence will go on through 2009
7649296 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7649297 team mascots will alternate innings driving a honda accord anywhere on the field
7649298 the snitch is played by a human being typically dressed in yellow who is allowed to run from the field pursued by the seekers on foot generally the entire school campus is considered fair game for the snitch
7649299 since this is professional calvinball all players are automatically disqualified
7649300 no gol blame it dang blammit i said the sheriff is a n
7649301 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7649302 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7649303 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7649304 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7649305 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7649306 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7649307 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7649308 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7649309 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7649310 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7649311 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7649312 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7649313 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7649314 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7649315 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7649316 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7649317 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7649318 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7649319 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7649320 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7649321 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7649322 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7649323 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7649324 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7649325 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7649326 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7649327 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7649328 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7649329 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7649330 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7649331 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7649332 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7649333 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7649334 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7649335 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7649336 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7649337 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7649338 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7649339 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7649340 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7649341 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7649342 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7649343 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7649344 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7649345 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7649346 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7649347 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7649348 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7649349 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
7649350 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
7649351 you can think about it as control by the director
7649352 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
7649353 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
7649354 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
7649355 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
7649356 a huge collection of the most improbable sepulchers that could accompany you in the afterworld
7649357 im so looking forward to having a break and taking some time off
7649358 it was just really great to meet him and people of his calibre
7649359 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7649360 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7649361 the other point to it is the reason we dont put aspirin in the drinking water or prescribe it to the whole population is that it carries some risk
7649362 why do i have to grow out of enjoying a live dj set
7649363 the problems i see in congress right now are due to partisanship
7649364 we believe that reichert can bring people together to deal with the challenges we are going to face
7649365 typically new employees have a 90 day probationary period to prove themselves
7649366 if dave reichert were in the board room with donald trump on the apprentice what would donald say
7649367 jim vaughn was absolutely right when he described republican dave reichert as an ineffective yes man for george bush
7649368 the truth is vaughn was a marginal candidate who raised no money won no endorsements and took a meaningless sliver of the primary vote and the idea his endorsement will get democrats to vote for reichert is a joke
7649369 randomly choosing numbers that match those drawn by the lottery
7649370 i am pleased to welcome dave to the mosys executive team
7649371 dave joins mosys with extensive experience in the electronics industry and a very successful track record of helping to grow companies
7649372 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7649373 sometimes in football you are faced with having to make difficult decisions involving good people
7649374 we believe this move will help us improve our secondary and ultimately win games we have some young talent on our roster and we are looking forward to seeing them on the field
7649375 if you have a completed zombie novel and it doesnt suck
7649376 i just amputated a soldiers arm with a hacksaw then i delivered a baby and fought my way through a horde of zombies punk so whatve you done today
7649377 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7649378 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7649379 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7649380 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7649381 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7649382 understood the clean city law to mean paint over anything thats irregular
7649383 because the law didnt give objective criteria it was left up to subjective opinion
7649384 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7649385 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7649386 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7649387 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7649388 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7649389 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7649390 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7649391 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7649392 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7649393 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7649394 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7649395 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7649396 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7649397 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7649398 all the factors that have motivated the price down are still intact
7649399 judging from the dollars gains crude oil should be down a lot but that is not the case as a developing storm in the carribean sea appears to be supporting oil
7649400 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
7649401 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
7649402 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
7649403 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
7649404 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness

7649411 there is no doubt anymore about that foreign partener lufthansa is in pole position to conclude an alliance
7649412 we are all winners and have done absolutely marvelous at this olympic prediction game d will be missing this application for the next 4 years and i hope sun would reintroduce this awesome game for the 2012 olympics
7649413 i just love to take part on games like this thanks a lot i had great fun
7649414 this game was the best experience ive lived because i played with people of other countries similar to the true olympic games
7649415 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7649416 i turned around and there was this guy swinging at everyone we saw him back my friend against the wall
7649417 my face feels like its melting not because i have been drinking deathklok riffs for breakfast and not because i decided to bob for apples in the toxic avengers piss sometimes you just wake up and your face feels like its melting like your face is too lazy to even tense itself up enough to keep all of your facial features intact and the only cure is fear of failure

7649421 we are fortunate to have such a versatile and accomplished artist on hand to mentor our students
7649422 johns extensive background and the variety of roles he has mastered speak to the type of well rounded actor we are training his first hand accounts of the intellectual emotional physical vocal and psychological demands of being an actor in the 21st century will offer invaluable insight to our students
7649423 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7649424 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7649425 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7649426 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7649427 we are reviewing the performance of all routes and have yet to make a conclusion
7649428 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7649429 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7649430 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7649431 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7649432 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7649433 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7649434 my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne

7649440 if god is with you the whole world can be against you
7649441 everything everybody in your life is hectic lets go do somethin
7649442 ooooh i love how everything melts together in my mouth delicious
7649443 this is what youre giving me for insert special occasion
7649444 im coming to get my mothers day present and while im at it see how shes keeping your house
7649445 in fact were concerned were able to manage the herd and keep them within the managing capacity of the land and we need to do that and the only way that can be done is to take out additional antlerless deer and i think most people will find the population has increased and there is not shortage of deer
7649446 we will fight this thing all the way until the end
7649447 in a case like this the hearing is a big deal because we have so many iraqi witnesses
7649448 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7649449 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7649450 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7649451 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7649452 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7649453 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7649454 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7649455 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7649456 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7649457 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7649458 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7649459 people are taking shorter vacations i see that happening at our campground i see people who may have camped in lake george last year not driving quite as far and camping closer to home
7649460 what it cost me to camp here for the whole summer would cost me a weekend to somewhere else
7649461 theres soccer hockey basketball football a lot of good sports
7649462 i guess its cheaper by air but we like to camp camping so i prefer my trailer even if it will cost me more
7649463 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7649464 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7649465 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7649466 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7649467 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7649468 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7649469 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

7649494 front doors seem to be a forgotten area of interior design with not a lot of choice
7649495 a row of victorian terraced housing may all look the same but it is likely they were built at different times and by different builders door openings werent standardised until the fifties when the size of a modern house started to be measured in multiples of metric bricks before this imperial bricks were used 28 bricks being the normal height of a front door
7649496 people refurbishing houses with modern interiors often want a very modern front door

7649505 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
7649506 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
7649507 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
7649508 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
7649509 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
7649510 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
7649511 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits

7649514 wow ok lets get those immediately you must be going through withdrawls by now flu like symptoms as well as the emotional stuff yes
7649515 once they get here unfortunately they can spread very quickly because we have a lot of students in closed quarters with a lot of interchange visiting each others classes
7649516 if we find a deposit of perchlorate one can speculate that water had melted at some point and had collected it into an accumulation
7649517 we also heated the sample differently the oxygen bearing compound presumably perchlorate might have been there but we might have destroyed it when we were looking for organic compounds
7649518 were not going to be looking for the organic compounds were going to use the same heating plan that we did on the first sample
7649519 in addition to looking for oxygen were going to look for chlorine
7649520 weve really got to sit down and think about what are our last two wcl samples going to be and can we find any gradient
7649521 thats going to be key to really saying something about water
7649522 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants

7649534 if russia decides to step back from those accession commitments that it has already made it will further delay its aspirations for joining the wto
7649535 by its recent actions russia is putting its aspirations at risk
7649536 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7649537 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7649538 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7649539 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7649540 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck
7649541 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7649542 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
7649543 ocupa vol menes y fojas enteras y estuvimos el s bado y ayer leyendo las carpetas y realmente no hicimos a tiempo por lo quepedimos al tribunal que nos de hasta un d a m s lo cual era analizado pero descartamos que se nos va a conceder
7649544 el 99 de todo el material que se pidi nos favorece por lo que no planteamos reparos cuando la defensa solicit un d a m s de tiempo
7649545 consideramos que las pruebas m s importantes a adi el abogado son las de el calafate donde hay un proceso en curso contra grassi aunque tambi n hay numerosas denuncias que se hicieron que tienen que ser analizadas
7649546 no tienen que ver con la supuestas denuncias an nimas contra el padre grassi que datan del a o 2000
7649547 esa carta an nima que se ley en el debate de unos supuestos empleados de la fundaci n es la foja n mero uno del expediente no es una prueba nueva desconocida hasta ahora
7649548 en los medios se la difunde como una nueva prueba y eso es absolutamente falso y malintencionado
7649549 creo saber de donde viene la difusi n falsa de datos que se realiza a los medios
7649550 grassi va a declarar en el juicio una vez que se termine de analizar toda la prueba junto al material f lmico que est en la causa
7649551 todas las auditor as y controles posteriores a la presentaci n de ese an nimo dieron como resultado negativo luego vino la proyecci n del programa televisivo en octubre del 2002 y se inici una causa distinta con un nuevo juez
7649552 la estrategia de grassi sigue siendo hacer un juicio por afuera del verdadero juicio y apela a dar ante los medios golpes de efecto como el de denunciar una venganza y advertir con que va a dar los supuestos nombres
7649553 el est en su derecho constitucional a defenderse su estrategia es declarar pero no referirse a los hechos y tratar de eludir el debate real de todas formas es una estrategia que a nosotros nos favorece

7649575 parei muito para pensar e cheguei conclus o que eu sou um dos caras que pode salvar o n utico dessa situa o acho que minha volta ao time e a entrada de alguns jogadores que est o fora deve dar um novo ritmo a equipe
7649576 foi bom porque nossos atletas pelo menos demonstraram mais disposi o mas ficou claro que os mesmos erros continuam acontecendo novamente levamos gol no final do jogo ficou provado pelo menos para mim que o culpado n o era eu

7649621 you are not qualified to be a petty officer third class
7649622 i believe many other sdf members are in a situation similar to my sons
7649623 to avoid repeating similar incidents the government should not take the ruling to the supreme court
7649624 it is the first court ruling that recognizes the governments violation of its obligation of ensuring security for national public servants over their psychological burdens
7649625 the superiors remarks and actions were within the scope of an instruction and the sailor killed himself because of mental fatigue as his frustration mounted against his own slow progress in training

7649925 theyll take a head coach who gets to the final four but theyll also like taking an assistant who has been to the final four if you look at the last couple hires theres been a final four theme to it i think everybody likes that final four or ncaa playoff thing
7649926 i think that theyre at the point right now where a lot of the intangible stuff is there
7649927 i think maybe a fresh start and do things just a little bit differently were just going to go to work and see what happens
7649928 i had to call and call and call just like anybody else
7649929 i had to call several times before i got anybody
7649930 im glad she got help to save her house im not mad at that im upset that the same people wouldnt help me and they denied it was going on
7649931 i had prisoners laughing at me when i approached them about it they knew what was going on it was hilarious to them
7649932 we had a resource that we could help somebody with i made a judgment that it was the right thing to do
7649933 i am prepared to pay for any services i receive just like any other citizen
7649934 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future

7649936 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
7649937 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
7649938 i tell you what what a difference a year makes rice feels like home this team feels like mine and thats exciting i like this football team i like how this camp is going weve got our numbers up weve had tremendous competition at all the positions i think theyve come out here with the attitude that they all want to get better and weve come out this year with an understanding knowing that we have to focus on the effort and not worry so much about the outcome that if we play passionate football goo things are going to happen for us i played for a guy named coach walker and all he ever taught us was do your best dont sweat the rest and winning will take care of itself thats what were trying to do this camp the one thing weve got tremendous senior leadership weve got three guys that are going into their third year at rice that are going to be team captains i havent been anywhere where you have sophomores elected captains and going into their senior year they can now influence an entire football team theyve done that not only have they worked hard this camp but weve had a lot of fun working hard i think all the indicators are if we keep working hard we can achieve something significant this year im just thrilled for how camp has gone since day one they are a team thats on a mission and they are a team that doesnt want to settle theyve proved that through all of the opportunities weve had in practice so far
7649939 what i love about coaching is you still experience all of the emotions of playing without the bruises so at this point right now i wake up this morning and i cant wait to get to work its one of those i want to get in that room i want to start planning i want to start looking at tape all of it is an attribute to these players its an exciting time now to be here at rice like i said seniors mean everything and we have tremendous senior leadership this year and we have continuity on the staff we lost a receiver coach and thats been it so everybody knows where they go they understand the language they understand the schemes and that makes it a lot of fun there hasnt been a day where i dont think we havent done something better than we did the day before
7649940 weve got to focus on the effort and not worry so much about the outcome the outcome will come we are building a great program here we expect a lot out of these seniors but i dont want them to walk out onto the field and think its a must win game i want them to relax play hard and have fun doing it they know what we expect we talk about it in our team meeting rooms what they have to worry about is just working hard not focusing on the end of the game but focusing on every play of how we have to execute it and how much passion we have to win in college football i dont know a coach in america that knows how many games theyre going to win or lose you cant know but i know that this team feels good about itself and this coaching staff feels good about this football team
7649941 its amazing i think until coaches trust players and the players trust the coaching staff its hard to win i know that these young men now know that ive kept my word to them on everything since the day i got here i know they trust me i know they trust this staff and to win those fourth and ones you got to trust each other i trust these guys at night that theyre going to be where theyre supposed to be at 11 oclock when you start getting all of the indicators that everybodys listening and everybodys doing whats asked of them weve made a major step in this program and i mean it when i say it were building something great it may be this year i dont know when its coming but its coming
7649942 all we can do is look at the hawaii tape on offense and look at the fresno tape you know june jones is going to do what he does were going to prepare for everything that theyve done in the past when we step on the field there wont be anything that we have not tried very hard to prepare for and once again the focus needs to be on what we do we just have to do better at what we do and do it with a little bit more passion and do it with more effort youve got to outwork people and thats what we intend to do
7649943 well you know hes a talented young man thats why june got him hes a local guy im sure theyre starting him because hes the best thats why were anticipating him to come out and play a great football game
7649944 it lets you get better everyday because youre not worried everybody knows now what formation is called and every play is called football is all about routine the more you can keep these guys in the routine like the texas tech offense those guys are like factory workers theres nothing that happens that they havent seen thats why its so critical that from year one to two its the same from year two to three its the same and that you continue to improve at what you do
7649945 one of the things i didnt know when i took the job i thought we could win just because of the relationship with the texas high school coaches they do such a great job you get in and you can see how rice can change a young man or womans life when you graduate here for the rest of your life where you see the kind of jobs that these people are getting right out of college rice is an easy sell weve learned that when we go into those living rooms now and say after five years we expect you to be the boss after ten years we expect you to pay your scholarship back and after 30 years we expect you to name a building named after yourself and heres the proof its not just a sales pitch its what happens at rice were embracing rice academically the football team had the highest gpa last semester on record we expect those guys to do well in school we expect them to do well in the community and we expect them to win on the football field those expectations are not going to change i expect these young men to win but right now where we are we need to focus on the effort
7649946 i dont remember what year it was but when they raised the sat scores everybody thought college athletics would be over but an amazing thing happened the young men just made the higher test scores i think theres been an academic swing in the united states where there are a lot more recruitable men and women than there have been in the past you look in this metroplex at the amount of young men that signed division 1 scholarships that are looking for this type of education and have the board scores where theyre admissible here i think were dealing with a larger recruiting pool which helps there are a lot of families out there not only in texas rice has a global reputation were trying to cast a net were going to do everything in texas but if we can find a great player from anywhere even from canada thats where were going to go if they have the board scores that rice is looking for i think men are a lot smarter in this decade than they were a decade ago young men are now able to look in to their future instead of just looking into the next day so young men can make decisions based on 40 years down the road instead of just four or five years
7649947 thats been a message all camp when something happens we cant panic its all about the next play we have some great stories where we try to hit home where they dont panic when something bad happens june jones knows exactly where he wants to go with the ball and where youre soft in coverage theyre going to complete some passes now theyre going to score some points thats just college football today the defense just has to understand that its the next play that is the most important lets regroup lets play harder than we did before and lets stick together thats where this senior class steps in i think were going to be able to hold together because there are going to be obstacles we hit that arent going to be fun but thats part of football and thats part of teams doing the right things to getting through those obstacles
7649948 right now im not going to have to start six freshmen on defense because a lot of those freshmen are sophomores and thats what im talking about like the guys at texas tech these guys are going to get better in our scheme every year were fitting routes and fitting runs better than any time last season thats why i know were coming out here every day and getting better
7649949 i tell you what as a coach i have to improve every day too
7649950 well im talking about just playing against baylor for instance when we ran two tight ends and two backs and thats not who are and what we do well by carefully analyzing all of the statistics we were going the wrong way i know not to do that this year little situations you learn more what chase clement s comfort level is jd jarett dillard and brian raines and how they are and what they can and cant do the whole staff knows that and when brian gets up here im sure hell tell you hes faster right now than hes ever been and thats because hes confident in what hes doing a year ago he had some questions when he played you cant play fast when you have questions you can only play fast when you have confidence

7649954 this story about john mccain losing track of how many houses he owns is a telling moment that helps to explain why he still thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong and why he offers just more of the same economic policies that weve gotten from president bush for the last eight years
7649955 couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
7649956 contrast ing americans struggle to pay their mortgages with mccains optimistic talk on the economy and his personal wealth
7649957 seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into

7649960 if these are all the right words why dont i ever hear them from you
7649961 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
7649962 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7649963 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7649964 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7649974 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7649975 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7649976 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7649977 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7649978 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7649979 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7649980 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7649981 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7649982 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise

7649996 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
7649997 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
7649998 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7649999 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
