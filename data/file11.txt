110022 vietnam has a new raft of legislation designed to open up and improve the environment for conducting business especially so also in the real estate sector
110023 real estate law has been improved by the recent laws such as the law on real estate business dated 29 june 2006 and construction law passed on 26 november 2003 most foreigners are now aware of long leases of 50 years and in special circumstances 70 years available to secure investment in property in vietnam
110024 the recent devaluation of vnd vietnamese dong against usd is putting more weight on the cost of construction which has increased 40 percent from q3 07
110025 registered fdi foreign direct investment has experienced exponential increases in the last three years attracting more than usd15 billion so far this year being double that over the same period of last year which is confirmation in itself that foreign investors remain optimistic about vietnams long term future and potential
110026 the situation looks to worsen given the shared borders of economic tiger china with the earthquake in sichuan province steel demand along with construction materials with continue to move upward resulting in slower growth than anticipated
110027 its all about upside and in a country of 80 million people with natural resources and proximity to key markets such as china hong kong and singapore its a blank piece of paper at this point

110035 vietnam dethroned india which had the top spot three years straight on a t kearneys global retail development index which ranks countries based on a variety of factors such as economic and political risk per capita income market saturation and market attractiveness

110055 indestructible as the memories we have of them those killed
110056 a lot of families ideas were included in the design its very different the stelae remind me that prior to july 7 these 52 people that died stood tall in this world the material itself is as indestructible as the memories we have of them
110057 we wanted a proper memorial so we have taken our time
110058 i felt right at the outset that it would be very difficult to adequately find a memorial that would express everything that needs to be expressed about those that died and the manner in which they died
110059 was to find a silent thing that can eloquently say the unsayable
110060 not only honours and represents the 52 that were killed in its completeness and use of materials the design itself is something that is world class its a great piece of art as well as a memorial
110061 all the dreams and aspirations that the 52 families have had have all been embraced somewhere in the design
110062 i was interested in what beyond our own lives this memorial will be to the world i think it will still have a narrative
110063 the choice of location was very important to us july 7 was not just a personal loss but affected the city as a whole were very proud that its in hyde park
110064 it was not a faceless crime and we spent some time looking at personal tributes
110065 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for loss victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of the curious visitor
110066 it is a shocking indictment that after 100 years of the state pension we still have millions of older people living in poverty and many more struggling to make ends meet
110067 the government needs to take a serious look at how benefits are paid
110068 each year more than 5 billion in benefits for older people goes unclaimed because of over complicated application requirements and government departments not talking to each other
110069 we would like to give pensioners more but we must balance that with the ability of young people with families to pay taxes
110070 the npc proposal would cost in the region of 30 billion per year in the early years thats equivalent to an increase of around 7p on the basic rate of income tax this would knock out the national insurance fund in three years

110078 die zeitungen werden mit sicherheit die geplante t tigkeit ihrer korrespondenten neu berdenken
110079 wir appellieren an das internationale olympische komitee und vor allem an die verantwortlichen auf chinesischer seite eine unbehinderte berichterstattung zu garantieren
110080 wenn jetzt die arbeit unserer eigenen korrespondenten am austragungsort der olympischen spiele eingeschr nkt wird dann ist dies eine neue dimension von zensur gegen die wir uns mit unseren mitteln zur wehr setzen m ssen
110081 damit kann man zum beispiel farbnachweise f r bestimmte stoffe bei biologischen experimenten machen
110082 man braucht das zwar in der schule nicht unbedingt aber diese farb experimente sind schon recht eindrucksvoll
110083 fast im stundentakt liefen an manchen tagen bei uns neue meldungen ein
110084 aber wenn sie berlegen dass eine typische handgranate etwa 50 gramm sprengstoff enth lt dann sind 200 gramm pikrins ure schon ein grund zur vorsicht
110085 dass zehn bereinander gestapelte laptop akkus mehr energie enthalten als ein kilo pikrins ure
110086 die gefahrstoffbeauftragten an unseren schulen werden regelm ig geschult auf deren fachkenntnis verlassen wir uns
110087 hoffentlich wissen auch diejenigen lehrer bescheid die in biologie und chemie fachfremd unterrichten und deshalb vielleicht nicht alle stoffe in der chemikaliensammlung so genau kennen
110088 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
110089 je nach grundlage sind wasserhaltige cremes ohne konservierungsstoffe etwa eine bis vier wochen haltbar wenn sie in eine tube oder spenderdose abgef llt sind die genaue aufbrauchfrist ist auf dem etikett aufgef hrt
110090 die ergebnisentwicklung im ersten halbjahr 2008 ist insgesamt und angesichts der gestiegenen herausforderungen insbesondere im regulatorischen umfeld aber auch auf der beschaffungsseite gut das um 12 prozent auf 1 017 millionen euro gestiegene adjusted ebit zeigt dass die operative ertragslage der enbw gut und eine robuste grundlage f r unsere wachstumsinvestitionen ist

110092 we had a meeting with ochoa to tell him we refused the offer from everton and galatasarays proposal was just unsatisfactory
110093 neither us or the player think that a loan for a player of the quality of ochoa is something serious
110094 we have arranged with ochoa that beside the fact he has a contract with america until 2010 if an important offer appears next year we will do all we can do to transfer him because good players like him deserve to be transferred to a european team and improve their career
110095 but for the moment ochoa will stay in america until december at least and after that we will see
110096 the competition for places is great and we need that in the premier league
110097 when it comes to possibly selling players you can never say never although us managers are greedy and you never really like to let anyone go
110098 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid that is why it is better not to look at it we will just take who we get
110099 we just have to improve now to use the two tournaments we play to get physically stronger and better then we will play who we get

110103 i didnt know that but its of no importance to me at all to be honest
110104 i would just like to continue with the momentum i have to score more points this weekend
110105 if we have the car to win then we will go for that otherwise it would be nice to just be on the podium before the break
110106 but right now i love my car obviously at the first grand prix in australia i loved it then
110107 but i didnt hit the sweet spot for a couple of races although at the last few races the car has been the best it has ever been
110108 it should be that way weve been working very hard to develop it and weve seen the evolution of the car
110109 for me personally to rediscover that sweet spot ive spent a lot more time with my engineer analysing things and trying to work out where we have gone wrong on weekends
110110 with the team they always have the determination and the power to keep on pushing with some new parts and components for the car
110111 what weve done at recent tests at hockenheim silverstone and jerez weve really extracted the most from them
110112 that is all due to reliability making good parts and with all that weve made some good steps forward
110113 its a lot more relaxed theres a nicer environment things are how they should be
110114 were here to race were focusing on that and thats the most important thing there are no distractions
110115 its a much better position to be in and thats where every team aims to be
110116 without those distractions we all feel as a team its of benefit going forward if we are to go on and win the title
110117 we dont have any excess baggage on our shoulders no stress like that
110118 we just have the excitement of working hard to improve the car and of scoring points thats where everyone wants to be

110123 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark
110124 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
110125 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads
110126 these churros are made at home and brought into the market to sell still hot and covered with granulated sugar
110127 the menu is churros and four kinds of hot chocolate and thats it
110128 i am so wild about churros theyre one of my favorite things in the whole wide world
110129 i think its all part of the big latino boom in the u s
110130 weve worked a lot of latino ingredients into our cooking and weve hit the second wave now people are thinking past hard shell tacos and looking for more authentic flavors
110131 hispanics are by far the largest minority in the u s and we are just starting to see the tremendous impact on our culture
110132 when i first opened the original store in san rafael california in 2003 i didnt see many churros around but now especially in the last year theyre popping up all over the place
110133 they mean a lot to people it gets them thinking about being with their families and we get a lot of emotional reactions weve had people who come in and cry

110160 it took me a long time to get over last year
110161 i thought a month after the season he still looked miserable
110162 everything you did well in the first part of the season has to be taken up a level and you have to spend extra time studying and preparing because opponents now know what youre capable of
110163 so you have to understand how the defense is going to attack you in different ways and we didnt understand that last year

110203 todays announcement sends a clear message that governments right across canada are united in their efforts to enforce canadas tobacco tax laws and fight contraband tobacco in this country
110204 together the civil and criminal payments effectively ensure that no monetary benefit was realized as a result of these activities
110205 theres no winners in this because the industry has addicted a whole bunch of young people who then became lifetime annuities for these companies
110206 over time the companies will financially benefit and literally thousands of people will die in the future as a result of this crime
110207 todays events give our business the stability it needs to move forward

110227 its not because were making it up thats what it is we need to understand and deal with that reality

110245 but there is a pretty nasty wound and they still need to get stitches there
110246 we expect to have more smartphones and qwerty devices and touch and music phones
110247 so that we make the overall spectrum of products more robust
110248 climate change is expected to increase a broad range of risks to the health of canadians
110249 even if rapid reductions of greenhouse gases can be achieved in the near term there is virtual certainty that climate change will be experienced for decades to come because of inertia in the climate system
110250 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health
110251 in addition medications commonly used by seniors such as those used to treat chronic cardiovascular disease may exacerbate the effects of extreme heat
110252 the 1998 ice storm that affected eastern canada played a crucial role in building up momentum to increase the capacity to cope with extreme weather
110253 we certainly cant control the level of emotion that certain people can feel given such accusations
110254 he was very nice every time i had conversations with him
110255 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer yet im told each of you reacted swiftly calmly and with bravery
110256 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
110257 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot
110258 he had the guy on the ground he was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
110259 he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the victims head in his hand and the knife and then dropped the head in front of us
110260 this government has finished its mission irrespective of who will head kadima
110261 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections

110277 overall this result is a clear disappointment especially since almost all preliminary indications for the month pointed to modest growth
110278 the widespread nature of the weakness underlines the fact the economy is swimming upstream
110279 all in all this confirms the bank of canadas assessment that the canadian economy will slow
110280 if we assume a flat june reading for gdp the second quarter might only be as high as 0 5 per cent that suggests the bank will not really be in a position to raise rates until well into 2009
110281 we will continue our ongoing capital investments into improving our wastewater treatment and council looks forward to working with the federal and provincial governments to share the costs associated with protecting our waterways
110282 ability to deal with the old bridge is limited by its financial resources
110283 translink needs to proceed on the basis of a tolled bridge if its going to be able to respond with the urgency required to address the problems created by the pattullo
110284 the development of a plan for the construction of a new tolled crossing to expedite the replacement of the existing pattullo bridge and improvements to related infrastructure
110285 partnership opportunities with affected local and senior governments and stakeholders that have an interest in the pattullo corridor
110286 a new bridge can be built in a shorter time as a remedy for all of the technical limitations imposed by the current 71 year old crossing
110287 have eliminated overnight crashes since they began three years ago
110288 nobody likes tolling but if translink doesnt have the money to build a new bridge and feels its the only option were supportive
110289 didnt even have a single membership list held by the national party he said adding
110290 there are liberals here in montreal who are getting called from two sides
110291 youd have to build a long one and the stability of the tunnel given the geological nature would require an awful lot of bolting and the price was considered too high
110292 no searches are planned today and we have no reports of missing or overdue people
110293 we arent 100 certain but we are crossing our fingers
110294 we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them
110295 will the film series evermore known as indy lite hold up when compared directly to a revived indiana jones
110296 next time i say weve been in tougher spots than this i mean this
110297 we have very aggressive targets here in the province for greenhouse gas emissions
110298 were looking at all options were going to do an analysis on this and see if the benefits outweigh the costs
110299 its a good idea but i dont think itll work theres a lot easier ways to go about conserving
110300 one of the challenges is the fact the government owns so few buildings
110301 most government departments find themselves in private buildings which tend to house companies and other businesses so it would be pretty difficult to turn off the air conditioning in a building if youve still got four or five floors of a private company
110302 there are so many issues here that you have to look at
110303 theres private industries private businesses unions that you have to talk to
110304 i dont think that we can afford not to do it
110305 across the country that would give an infusion of cash every single year
110306 it would turn it into an investment in a system that could help people get out of their car on occasion of course it also helps people who cant afford a car or who find the price of gas is getting higher and higher
110307 most canadians wouldnt even consider voting ndp so it truly is mythical
110308 it was unbelievable how fast the flames came up it was really going
110309 life will go on this was a nightmare and its over
110310 i had suffered from some death scenes that i witnessed while a member of the department
110311 with my mind mixed up and soaked in beer sometimes a thought would pop into my head start a grass fire i can not say why this would enter my mind or worse yet why i would act on it
110312 my entire family dave janzen the oliver fire department rcmp and everyone in oliver and the surrounding area
110313 its refreshing and clear and not too cold at all
110314 when we were kids we went swimming all the time
110315 i wasnt the competitive swimming type or the lifeguard type but i did manage to learn the basics
110316 those of us who used to swim in the harbour can now do so again and this time we can take our children and grandchildren
110317 over the years there were giant schemes and schematics and dreams and all kinds of other things that previous councils had contemplated but nothing was being done so this council heard loud and clear that the public wanted it done
110318 here we are almost a year after the halifax plant started up and the dartmouth plant just in operation and we certainly dont see the unspeakable brown floatables anymore
110319 before each and every day 200 million litres of raw sewage and waste water flowed into this body of water
110320 the significance of this is just trend setting in terms of the things that you couldnt do before now you can
110321 im not much of a swimmer but i used to paddle at mic mac aquatic club
110322 i think it will be great its certainly another one of the recreational activities that we want to encourage people to participate it on the northwest arm and in the harbour
110323 he crossed the intersection where he was supposed to stop
110324 he collided with the van and it was kind of a chain reaction that van was flipped over on its side and a small honda civic collided with that vehicle
110325 he was placed in a holding room to make a telephone call at which point our officers became involved in an emergency situation with another prisoner who was threatening to harm himself
110326 mr stroud used that opportunity to exit the holding room hed been placed in and leave the booking area
110327 all the circumstances surrounding how it happened and whether or not policy was followed are actually under review by one of our staff sergeants to understand how this happened and to prevent it from happening in the future
110328 i was just looking out my window and a car came flying then two seconds later the cops came flying with their sirens on
110329 ive seen myself as a member of this free and dynamic city after living here for more than four years but ive not been registered as a permanent resident all this time and am still labeled as part of the migrant population
110330 i hope the situation can change with this new system
110331 the introduction of the new residence certificate system is aimed at gradually removing the barriers between the permanent and migrant populations so they can enjoy equal rights here and regard the city as their home
110332 the fiscal system of the shenzhen government will care not just for registered permanent residents but also for the migrant population
110333 more public services including social security will gradually benefit the whole community
110334 i dont feel a large difference between the new card and the old card
110335 neither do they have political rights within the local community
110336 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
110337 and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns
110338 stood in front of the gunman and took the blast to protect the rest of us
110339 john mccain calls himself an underdog that may be an understatement
110340 is that while you can do opinion journalism and incorporate reporting into it you cant say youre doing straight reporting and then add opinion to that
110341 trop de promotions tue les promotions trop de soldes tue des soldes et quand vous navez pas de pouvoir dachat vous pourriez faire des soldes nuit et jour ouvrir m me le dimanche a ne sert strictement rien
110342 cest une erreur et moi je pars du principe que les soldes ce sont deux v nements par an si on fait des soldes r currentes ce nest plus du tout le c t v nementiel a ne sert strictement rien
110343 si on fait des soldes cest simplement pour r cup rer nos billes comme on dit au casino il faut quand m me avoir une marge b n ficiaire donc cest totalement ridicule

110345 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
110346 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
110347 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
110348 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
110349 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
110350 i was really down by it really felt like i couldnt do anything
110351 it worked well for a while but i guess it wasnt too hard to figure out what she had to do in the third set she started playing much more to my forehand it was just so frustrating that i couldnt control the racket in my hand i couldnt feel anything
110352 it was very frustrating i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player and she figured it out i give her credit for taking her chances and winning this match
110353 about 10 days ago i started to get pain here and i couldnt hold my racquet at all in my hand we did tape it helped a little bit yesterday also i felt a little bit but not so weak today i really felt weak in my hand that i couldnt really hold my racquet firmly
110354 when i started thinking about how much time the movies were taking i thought can i actually do a music career
110355 and i thought i dont wanna put myself up to that and the film work seems to be going just fine and i can love music and just be where im at
110356 but my wife said why dont you do this music seems to make you very happy she kind of was a great partner in the whole thing and every four months she would revisit that because i think deep down she knew how much i loved it
110357 when i started playing with the first three guys for as good as they were i didnt feel really comfortable and i stopped after about two months and then i didnt do anything
110358 and chris looked at me and she goes what are you gonna do and i said i dunno maybe im not gonna do it and she said why
110359 thats when i called johnny and we started writing songs and i said look i dont know where this is gonna go but i just wanna start writing music again and start playing and it just evolved
110360 i dont know if ive done the right thing at the end of the day or not
110361 i think if people have manners then its going to be an exceptional night
110362 i think if people really want to engage in really good discourse i think itll be a really exceptional night
110363 and i think if anybody wants to go to a place that would be awkward for either myself or them itll be a mistake
110364 for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love
110365 rachel is such a beautiful and brilliant ingenue in those previous two films and i knew i could never fill her shoes
110366 so we decided to make a new pair of shoes
110367 i did have one accident where i was shooting my winchester in the rotunda and a cartridge came up and hit me below the eye
110368 if it had been a quarter inch higher i wouldve been in real trouble
110369 i felt like i was a 12 year old boy at the playground i took gun lessons and sword fighting for two months and worked on wires i did 90 percent of my own stunts because i had a great team of trainers
110370 its been seven years since the second mummy film so it gives you liberty to have the roles recast
110371 but gosh he knows what he wants and would fire away about everything that was going on
110372 every 5 or 10 minutes people get up to go to the bathroom or to step outside to smoke
110373 erics the guy who came up with premium bottled olive juice for dirty martinis
110374 instead of draining the liquid from a big jug of olives you just pour it from a bottle there are eight other brands out there doing it right now but erics was the first
110375 something like a dome you could put over your drink
110376 all we gotta do is put a hole in it
110377 a device and method of use with a vessel e g glass or bottle holding a drink to indicate that the person to whom the drink belongs has not abandoned it and or his her seat and or to protect the drink
110378 its a coaster that makes your bartenders life easier and gives your customer more benefit
110379 ive seen myself as a member of this free and dynamic city after living here for more than four years but ive not been registered as a permanent resident all this time and am still labeled as part of the migrant population
110380 i hope the situation can change with this new system
110381 the introduction of the new residence certificate system is aimed at gradually removing the barriers between the permanent and migrant populations so they can enjoy equal rights here and regard the city as their home
110382 the fiscal system of the shenzhen government will care not just for registered permanent residents but also for the migrant population
110383 more public services including social security will gradually benefit the whole community

110387 i was raising to thin the field and mix it up
110388 i didnt want to always limp in under the gun
110389 theres a good chance that my hands good but i had some short stacks behind me and i thought there was a good chance one of them might shove
110390 i think raymond has a small pocket pair he was in the blind and just the way he was acting i felt like if he had a 7 he wouldve tried to maximize it tried to check raise or lead out more i think he was trying to protect his underpair and didnt bet out enough when the guy on the button called i had no idea what he had
110391 you cant be scared because an overcard hits the board like that on the river because it wouldnt have made any sense for someone to be holding it at that point
110392 why would anybody have a 10 in their hand at that point and not have bet it earlier if it were a pair it doesnt fit the equation if it doesnt make sense then you need to maximize value and get a bet out there
110393 six of one six artists of contemporary mind united by exchange
110394 i am an unyielding advocate for the well being of children around the world and do not condone or endorse smoking
110395 whether tobacco sponsorship of music events leads to youth smoking is a matter of serious debate

110397 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
110398 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us
110399 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
110400 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
110401 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
110402 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

110410 how did you come to a restitution figure without knowing what his assets are
110411 i have known him five or six years we met at the church in ofallon he was very kind professional and children seemed to be his focus for all of the right reasons
110412 he is a pastor someone children are taught to respect and trust i thought i was being very careful now i am very very very careful
110413 the normal routine was for him to pick the children up on thursdays and fridays and take them to my aunts house
110414 i guess my son thought he wanted to finish his conversation with my daughter about the incident at school he told me he stopped at my home to use the bathroom
110415 my aunt had already told me her face was flush and she had been crying when she arrived at her home
110416 i know you dont believe that and i know youre not going to ruin my reputation not only am i a pastor but i am an auxiliary police office
110417 i knew then it was time to end the conversation and go to the police which i did
110418 if there are i pray they and their families will have the courage to step up and tell their story i dont want another child or family to go through what were dealing with
110419 she never talks about the incident ive been told by counselors she could experience many side effects i hope and pray that she continues to be ok
110420 its true that not everyone can afford to buy their own car so it could be very useful
110421 today we have consumer habits whether its going to ikea or elsewhere which necessitate that once in a while even those who cant afford cars need to use one and in this sense i think this will complement public transportation
110422 we should be open to this type of initiative knowing that there is not one solution to the problems of transportation and climate change

110465 the ordinary profile of someone in his position is of a caretaker but he might behave differently he might feel more liberated
110466 we are closer than ever to understandings that are liable to be the basis for agreements on two tracks of rapprochement the palestinian and the syrian
110467 as long as i serve in my position i will not rest from the attempt to bring the negotiations between us and our neighbors to a successful conclusion
110468 he doesnt have a choice because hes between a rock and a hard place
110469 the only other card he has to play is to go home and dismantle the palestinian authority
110470 it will be essentially treading water while they wait to see who will be the next
110471 theres a view that it actually doesnt matter who is going to be israeli prime minister
110472 from the arab perspective theres a certain frustration with political instability in israel and that political instability makes it difficult for israelis to have a coherent approach
110473 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
110474 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed
110475 i dont think that politicising the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
110476 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
110477 and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
110478 the ioc and the chinese government i think are the ones to be held accountable here i think the blame related for anything related to the politicisation of the olympics really falls on their shoulders
110479 the ioc is not true to its word has never been true to its word and the leadership of jacques rogge has seriously and forever damaged the olympic movement and all that it means to the world
110480 i told ya he passes out when he get excited
110481 hahahahaha what happened he turned geek squad and he was so cute as a baby
110482 has no one read national geographic or the discovery channel am i missing somethin i
110483 patric lol i think youre dog may be a slut
110484 i told ya he passes out when he get excited
110485 hahahahaha what happened he turned geek squad and he was so cute as a baby
110486 has no one read national geographic or the discovery channel am i missing somethin i
110487 patric lol i think youre dog may be a slut
110488 i broker domains every day in the online gaming economy industry
110489 we got stuck with a co uk version of the domain we wanted
110490 but we played it to our advantage by marketing heavily to those in the uk and beefing up local seo in great britain the results show for themselves we had record breaking profits last quarter
110491 privacy is absolutely key in the online gaming economy business
110492 once top domains are registered their security protection and legacy becomes mission critical
110493 one of the most amazing online gaming economy related sales we had was in last septembers auction
110494 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the online gaming economy domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
110495 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
110496 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
110497 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for online gaming economy companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
110498 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
110499 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
110500 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the online gaming economy internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain
110501 but when you think about it you want a domain that people can remember and a domain that is free of any blacklist status so that you can use it to freely communicate with online gaming economy customers
110502 i told ya he passes out when he get excited
110503 hahahahaha what happened he turned geek squad and he was so cute as a baby
110504 has no one read national geographic or the discovery channel am i missing somethin i

110506 diffusione illecita e sfruttamento commerciale dei file audiovisivi di propriet del gruppo

110508 le olimpiadi non contano molto per la maggior parte dei giovani dei paesi emergenti ed industrializzati

110510 siamo sicuri che questa rivoluzione digitale riguardi anche il resto del mondo quanto la realt americana si avvicina a quella europea e in particolare a quella italiana le innovazioni tecnologiche le sperimentazioni digitali le strategie di comunicazione non convenzionali riguardano davvero anche il vecchio continente tanto da poter parlare anche noi di rivoluzione
110511 el d a 12 tenemos nuestra primera final pero somos el bar a y s lo debemos pensar en nosotros mismos
110512 paris hiltons out of town lindsay lohans got a new girlfriend and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
110513 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
110514 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsay lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
110515 i am not ashamed of what i do everybody benefits from the paparazzi retail hotels tourism
110516 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
110517 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
110518 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
110519 he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue
110520 only a matter of time before someone crosses the line
110521 i think its only a matter of time before someone crosses the line
110522 i am massively concerned because we are at the start of four years in which kids who are now 15 or over will want to be on the start line in london which will be the biggest thing to hit british sport in our lifetime
110523 the fact is that we have epo an increasing drug of choice for a number of disciplines we have growth hormone which it has been demonstrated you can get from a pub on the corner and we have testosterone available all over the internet
110524 i think its only a matter of time before someone crosses the line
110525 the rewards for success in 2012 will be absolutely enormous and at some point some will say you know what im going to take the risk what we have to do is help them make informed choices and realise that they can make it clean
110526 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it
110527 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
110528 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
110529 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
110530 we have the fire brigade down there with a mud rescue kit because its actually stranded on the mud so its quite difficult to get to
110531 the fire brigade are hosing it down because they dont want the skin to dry out
110532 the fire crews encountered an extremely demanding and hazardous situation in relation to the intense heat and smoke that was being generated by the fire
110533 unfortunately the search and rescue team located three fatalities on board the vessel
110534 but the main thing i saw was as a defensive unit we got better
110535 i say awful if you look statwise and what we gave up and how much better we could have been theres a tremendous amount of improvement to be made
110536 i was proud of the way after we lost jeff and after we lost clint after we lost our whole secondary after four games we hung together and made some plays in the air force game made some plays in the notre dame game made some plays throughout the year to help us win eight ballgames
110537 the challenging part was i had to use my brain and say would you rather play an extra season or would you rather play two more games watching the guys step in and do an outstanding job i know im going to have to work harder to win my spot back
110538 a lot of the times last year we had to rely on our offense to carry us through late in games
110539 you could see that someone took the time someone loved her enough to put clothes on her
110540 the thinking was it was young girls who became pregnant and didnt know what to do there have been situations where a person has abandoned a baby and went home and found a family member was very supportive we go from there
110541 there is so much help out there that all they need to do is call a social service agency or a church
110542 there are places to go that would provide information anonymously and confidentially to anyone who is feeling trapped by pregnancy or parenting
110543 it would be better to get help and think it through than to abandon your baby and have second thoughts all your life
110544 the baby wasnt thrown in the trash she wasnt thrown in the toilet mama did a good job there
110545 i hope she knows that she did the right thing her baby is safe
110546 we have to pay much more attention to the foreign market than we used to
110547 its a little pompous for us to say in los angeles that this is the title period and the film must always be known as that
110548 if the title means nothing in another language thats a problem
110549 warm weather states such as arizona have been historically shortchanged by this program due to a complex and outdated formula that favors cold weather states
110550 when it was developed it favored cold weather states it takes heating degree days when heaters are needed into account we dont have a lot of heating days in arizona
110551 the summer heat always creates a crisis but this year the crisis could reach incredible proportions if quick decisive and aggressive action isnt taken
110552 its a dangerous situation when you come into this valley violating the health code
110553 we have an international epidemic with contaminated food people are on the corner selling this garbage
110554 i think the city council also took a look at the mission and the council members felt that that had been happily achieved
110555 this doesnt make sense weve all given our sweat blood and tears
110556 weve really got to do some exciting things but all good things have to come to an end
110557 i know as individuals we will continue to promote phoenix
110558 obviously the board views those who take an opposing view very dimly
110559 as a private club phoenix country club does not discuss internal affairs especially membership issues
110560 most men are indifferent to the policy or are against it
110561 but you become a leader of the club by being visible and you become visible by being seen in the mens grill and the way the mens grill is set up suits those men
110562 it became clear to me that there is a silent majority here that wants these changes or recognizes that its time for them to go
110563 there are so many initiatives so many candidates i looked at my sample ballot the other day and its a mini phone book of people running for office
110564 i think when obama and mccain both speak out about it it piques peoples interest
110565 if they succeed in liberal states its hard to see how they wouldnt succeed in places like arizona and nebraska
110566 i do not believe in quotas i have not seen the details of some of these proposals but ive always opposed quotas
110567 he talks about how he opposes quotas and therefore supports the initiative but quotas are illegal across the country and have been for quite some time
110568 his statements clearly demonstrate he doesnt understand what arizona laws are and what is at stake in this election
110569 john mccain believes in the protection of civil rights and equal opportunity for all americans
110570 hes committed to aggressively enforcing our nations anti discrimination laws and to the education of all of americas children so they have the necessary tools to compete and succeed in life
110571 its clear to me that he did change his position but so did millions of americans over the last few years
110572 senator obama should be grateful for race flippers because if it wasnt for them he would not have been elected the nominee of the democratic party
110573 katzav why are you only out to where the water is up to your chin
110574 this would not have been the right time or the appropriate time to change what seems to be moving in the right direction
110575 it means that were given the opportunity to continue going forward with our improvements were not going to lose sight of what we need to do because we never ever want to slide back to where we were
110576 students who come from the poorest neighborhoods need good schools the most because often they dont get as much help
110577 my responsibility is do everything i can to say we dont have different standards we have the same high standards for everybody
110578 these really bring a unique flavor to the downtown something that cant be found elsewhere
110579 but we broke into tears holly and me both and we sat there and talked for a while mainly using an interpreter because spanish is his primary language
110580 his english has gotten a lot better during the two weeks he has been home
110581 he knows all of his numbers in spanish but he can only count to 11 in english
110582 i have nothing on my desk that wont fit in under the current zoning
110583 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
110584 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
110585 but you take little bits but he has seen and done everything and i have tried to learn from the way he never panics
110586 he just takes his time and makes a decision and sticks by it
110587 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
110588 it was pure instinct i had never even done it in practice i was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball so i didnt know it was going in thankfully it did
110589 funnily enough we had done something very similar to liverpool in the fa cup earlier that season and i got the winner then so while we were surprised to beat bayern it wasnt a shock that we achieved it in the way we did
110590 three years before i came on as a substitute in the fa cup final against millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for united
110591 i knew i needed another operation and i just felt that would be it
110592 so to win the premier league again one that my eldest son noah was old enough to remember gave me something i will always treasure
110593 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
110594 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
110595 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
110596 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
110597 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
110598 its natural that companies are grabbing the chance to take advantage when the patriotic sentiment is at its peak
110599 but this marketing strategy that appeals only to patriotism could give rise to excessive nationalism
110600 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
110601 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
110602 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
110603 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
110604 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso
110605 the flip side of that is he cannot turn down the offer to take the position
110606 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
110607 the first lady called on the ancestral spirits to defend preah vihear and chase away the enemy
110608 aber wie hei t es so sch n gegens tze ziehen sich an
110609 hes just not dealing with the same set of cards he had in spring training
110610 this is the team paying me a lot of money and this is where i want to be
110611 i hate to be put in this situation and now i look like a bad guy again
110612 theyve just got to pitch better they should be able to do better
110613 theyre not sandy koufax and don drysdale but theyre not a ball pitchers either
110614 i hate players who make 100 million and feel sorry for themselves when my dad still has to work
110615 this is a great honor for the county to have a tree of this stature no pun intended
110616 in england they used to use trees like this to make masts for the navys sailing ships
110617 i cant see any kind of issue with him in any way he just looks good as he can possibly look its all good with him right now
110618 if big brown finishes the haskell the right way im going to forget about trying to figure the belmont out
110619 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore a whole lot depends on what happens sunday
110620 the breeders cup is definitely on top of the list even though you know this race here is more important than any race for him right now
110621 whatever happened in the belmont i dont feel that its my fault
110622 i dont feel i did anything wrong i know the horse went into the race very very good
110623 the rumours about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly
110624 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
110625 blair is in a t shirt and bermuda shorts and were discussing the new oasis lp the beatles we talked about who was the best songwriter in teenage fanclub he thought gerry love and i thought norman blake that was the conversation i was having with tony blair thats how strange how totally f ing psychedelic things had become
110626 we were involved we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be so it was just one of those things
110627 we could please other clubs its just the fact that weve got to please ourselves a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that we just thought that maybe it was just a little bit too rich an ask for us
110628 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
110629 i think its good for the game all of the attention
110630 its been too long since we had an opinion piece on belgium
110631 weil ich schwul bin und mehrere geschlechtspartner die woche habe
110632 isnt it about time this pair was pensioned off from the today programme their interviews whilst poles apart are outdated robinson and davies are really showing them up at the moment perhaps the bbc should do a vorderman on them when their contracts come up for renewal
110633 was not the sort of person they wanted at the cartier
110634 however good a horsewoman i am im also a glamour model that embarrassed them ive met the
110635 polo should be for people who love horses not a media charade it should be for everyone little girls glamour girls working class girls like me no one should be excluded

110637 wie sehr eine ganze generation von einem einzigen medikament vorgeblich gepr gt oder deformiert werden kann hat die amerikanerin elizabeth wurtzel in ihrer autobiographie
110638 it is incredible to see what has happened at adlershof since the first time i came here in 1994
110639 adlershof is a remarkable story here we are not using knowledge from just the last 15 years but rather standing on the whole history of eastern germany
110640 optecbb is part of the national desire to strengthen the optics industry
110641 we encourage technology transfer and bring scientists and companies together the result is new products and employment in the region
110642 in particular we know that optical communication technology is strong in berlin along with optoelectronics and microsystems technology
110643 these are strong both in terms of industrial strength and position in the market thanks to the overall national strategy our strengths here complement those of other regions like thuringia and bavaria
110644 we have many smes in the region that deal with lighting and light measurement this is an increasingly important topic and berlin is in a good position to bring all of the players together
110645 what is certainly available here is a strong research base
110646 berlin was one of the biggest industrial centres in germany before history left it weakened today it is obvious that we have greatly recovered in terms of scientific research with three universities and about 100 extra university institutes but the disadvantage here is that the number of industrial partners you can find is still quite small compared to the number available elsewhere
110647 other cities have business parks for sure but they tend not to be so structured or with the resources that we have here
110648 previously we were in an incubator centre elsewhere on the site but we have been able to take the top floor of our current building to construct a compact and logistically sensible layout allowing our products to move around on the same floor of the building for ease of production and communication
110649 holoeye operates in a particular niche focusing on the development of adaptive micro optics and diffractive components for industrial applications
110650 links between us and optecbb were important in the beginning we were a small company without much budget for attending trade shows or promoting ourselves so optecbb arranged for shared booths showcasing several companies which were a good push for us in the beginning these days we have more products and we need the space for ourselves now that we have grown the infrastructure here still suits us with quite a few of the distributors and services we need just close by
110651 there are a number of excellent universities in the city and there is a large optics community and a strong optics tradition here its an open city for international employees with an attractive and varied labour market we can even attract people from munich sometimes the salary levels here are lower but so is the cost of living
110652 the decision was made to have a stronger clustering concentration on the new science park
110653 there was some concern that the number of students would go down as a result it is some distance from the centre of the city so students might go to the free or technical universities instead but in fact student numbers are increasing
110654 for us its interesting to see the opportunities available to transfer the work that we are doing into poss ible applications and to find partners for joint projects its always better to have an insight into what other people are really doing plus its very likely that when we need a special laser source or detector there will be a company close by who is actually working on this problem
110655 the three founders were physicists at hhi who worked on indium phosphide technology and integrated photoreceivers and we keep that close relationship
110656 we considered the subsidies that were available if we moved to the eastern part of berlin but we prefer the operational advantages that we have through being close to the hhi and apart from hhi the technical university berlin is also nearby this area has a strong tradition of technical development even if it is perhaps not as widely advertised or well known as adlershof
110657 apes roots are in the former gdr and the company started during a period of great uncertainty in germany
110658 we had some experience of developing instruments and we used our connections to old and new colleagues to help us establish the company we originally started in adlershof and were located there for some years but we were more technology oriented than most of the companies there and it was not so effective for us so we looked to move elsewhere
110659 we are in the ultrafast laser market and this market is comparably small
110660 plus we are oriented towards r amp d rather than industrial markets our own network of contacts is very strong and works well for us but we do not rely too much on networks such as optecbb we benefit from a worldwide net of distributors which we are going to expand more and more
110661 we have moved from being a glass dealer to supplying the photonics industry
110662 that means that we were manufacturing driven in the past but over recent years we have added the capacity for development work and brought in many resources for ideas design and system solutions by the integration of optical components with metal parts electronics and software this was a major step for us
110663 we try to keep good relations with clusters and academic institutions both to push the region forward and because we benefit from them being here in that sense its lucky that we have adlershof three universities and an active photonics cluster around us here but we are mainly driven by technology and systems know how that makes it more important to be in an area where you can find the right engineers and physicists and that is the reason that we are still here in berlin
110664 weve got an offer accepted for a player whos agree personal terms its just a case of tidying up the paper work on that
110665 there are a couple of other bits and pieces so its a busy time
110666 hopefully well have another one in before saturdays game against tranmere and were working hard on another deal
110667 wir haben morgen so eine geschichte ber handy klingelt ne im blatt
110668 ach dieses thema in dem erkl rt wird was der klingelton ber den menschen verr t
110669 also oben machen wir ein f nfspaltiges riesenfoto von einem mann der eine frau fotografiert mit dem handy das passt ja zur story
110670 dann haben wir noch ralf schumacher der entgeistert auf sein handy stiert und einen fu ballfan der ein handy in der hand h lt allerdings ist dann noch platz f r ein weiteres foto mir will aber absolut nichts mehr einfallen
110671 och da finden wir schon was schau mal das hier
110672 nunja das zeigt aber das men eines handys in dem gerade die nachrichtenfunktion aktiviert ist wo ist da der bezug zum klingelton
110673 okay dann schreiben wir drunter die auswahl an klingelt nen f r moderne handys ist gewaltig was sagst du
110674 das klingt super wird schon keiner merken dass es mein altes k750i ist das 2005 vorgestellt wurde
110675 es hat ein gespr ch zwischen frau schwan und herrn gysi gegeben
110676 die zehnte klasse holst du aber wirklich nach wenn du hier raus bist
110677 um zu zeigen dass die gesellschaft sich nicht alles gefallen l sst
110678 die statistik zeigt dass wir bei jungen menschen mit migrationshintergrund h ufiger gewaltph nomene finden

110742 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
110743 we just left the town of brandon and we were watching zorro and the next thing i know i hear somebody scream and i look back and theres some big guy holding this little fellow up between the bathroom door and the seat
110744 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
110745 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
110746 he comes up and he picks the head up and hes waving it in the window i just smoked a cigarette with this man the victim earlier the head and hes shaking it back and forth at the window and its intense right its sickening
110747 its basically really a beautiful open space very very rich in wildlife
110748 the school has a very good environmental policy theyre encouraged to respect their environment to recycle and to think about their future

110759 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
110760 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
110761 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
110762 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
110763 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
110764 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated
110765 he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
110766 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
110767 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
110768 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
110769 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
110770 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
110771 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
110772 im in a wheelchair and what would i be able to do to defend myself probably nothing so thats really scary
110773 i guess were going to have to go the airline way maybe have a search and baggage check x ray maybe
110774 really i dont know what you can do about security anymore
110775 after that going on im kind of nervous getting on and off
110776 maybe that would be an answer to make everyone put everything underneath instead of allowing any carry on
110777 because of the nature of the industry which is servicing a lot of small towns with pickups right along the side of the highway were not dealing with the same kind of a controlled environment like an airport
110778 it would be extremely difficult and impractical to introduce screening devices baggage checks at all these various locations i dont think thats the answer it just happened to be on a bus it could just as easily happened in a theatre in a bar in a shopping centre
110779 its brought to light the question of is there a possibility of security and screening and stuff but ive got to be honest with you i dont know that there is in most cases i just dont know how feasibly it could be done
110780 people use the bus because its cheap its affordable theyre not going to want to pay two or three people to stand there with a metal detector
110781 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
110782 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
110783 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
110784 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us

110793 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
110794 this is a question of federal priorities and the federal government putting money into lego building blocks as opposed to infrastructure in this part of the country
110795 there are so many areas in which the government could spend money here in atlantic canada
110796 and 10 000 to 15 000 handed to a municipality for infrastructure could be meaningful
110797 the first two years we did raise a fair bit of money ourselves and the federal member kind of put it over the top with the acoa funding
110798 the last three years that was our major source of funding the federal member
110799 canadas new government is getting things done for the young people of newfoundland and labrador
110800 with this investment of 10 000 we are giving our communitys young people a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge creativity skills and talent in leading edge technologies on an international scale
110801 i know that all our investments go through due diligence and this constitutes a good use of our resources
110802 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
110803 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
110804 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am

110806 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
110807 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
110808 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
110809 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
110810 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
110811 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
110812 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
110813 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
110814 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
110815 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
110816 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
110817 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
110818 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
110819 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
110820 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
110821 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
110822 mr bateman said the new location was no more than 10 minutes drive away
110823 looks like it was not a bad childhood after all so many great memories

110826 i can tell you what i think the sex is but im really not sure
110827 it might be a girl i think ive seen it a few times

110849 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
110850 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
110851 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
110852 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
110853 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
110854 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north north west and central afghan istan including to provinces close to and bordering kabul
110855 the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow in the past six months alone criminal gangs have attacked 12 un humanitarian convoys resulting in the loss of food for thousands of the poorest families
110856 the overall view is that we are seeing more violence but pretty much in the same places some times it expands into new areas but when it does it tends to be temporary
110857 we have gone from 30 000 to 50 000 troops and we are generating more activity because we are taking on the insurgents
110858 a large proportion of the violence has been caused by cross border activity
110859 this year it has become even easier for the insurgents to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven

110883 the law society of scotland does not have the power to consider the amount of fees charged by a solicitor but has responsibility in relation to considering the quality of service provided by the solicitor
110884 legal firms like many other businesses in scotland are feeling the effects of the current economic climate
110885 the law society is monitoring the situation and while at present relatively few solicitors have informed us of being made redundant we have had reports of support staff from firms across the country having lost their jobs which is a real concern
110886 the professional practice department is giving help and advice to solicitors who may yet be faced with losing their job or equally to solicitor employers who have never before been in the position of having to make people redundant
110887 the legal profession is not only being affected by the economic situation but also by changes in legislation for example the slowdown has come at a time when summary justice reforms are having a negative impact on the volume of criminal legal aid work
110888 as the representative body for solicitors and working closely with paralegal colleagues we share the professions concerns and will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide support to our members

110917 i seriously wasnt looking to work at the time i had a three month old when i was first approached and she was seven months old when we finally shot
110918 and this was a good job to have as a new mom because i would work for three days have a week off work for another day have another week off so i was able to manage for myself in my heart the time away from her
110919 ive barely worked since my daughter was born i did this and i also made farlanders with sam mendes but mostly ive been with her being a mother changes everything and has deepened everything in my life including my acting
110920 ive been asked whether ill choose things that are safe that have a more child appropriate content and i dont think i will
110921 the thing about motherhood is that it really does crack you open in every way i never knew that i could be so tired i never knew that i could work so hard i never knew that i could love so much or be so patient or be so excited by the tiniest little thing everything about it has surprised me
110922 i now suddenly find myself interested in playing people who are strong and capable and maybe not as broken as some of the other people ive played i feel like thats sort of what ive made a career doing and that this is sort of more unusual to play somebody whos pretty together who i really admire
110923 i was so surprised by the way it was misunderstood and the disdain that came back at me was a real shock
110924 i regret what i said but i think my intentions were good neither the red carpet nor an interview about a movie is the right place to talk about my politics i realise i have to be careful because its very easy to misunderstand a complicated thought in a complicated world
110925 ive been reading tons of plays recently because theres a theatre that im thinking about working with but the thing about doing a play is that for me it really has to be good and because youre doing the same thing every day its important to be working with people who are extraordinary otherwise it gets really boring and its awful so im really trying to find something that i feel will sustain me for a long time theres no point in doing it otherwise
110926 the club has sought clarification from the football association as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
110927 joey will be requesting a personal hearing in relation to the charge
110928 the incident has been the result of legal proceedings which concluded at manchester crown court on 1 july 2008 the fa has subsequently received all relevant documentation following the conclusion of this case and the charge is based on the certificate of conviction
110929 were responding to the downturn in spending and to the fact that people are finding it more difficult to go out as much
110930 and then if the opportunity to arrest and prosecute is there we will
110931 i think that if someones killed with one of these loyalist weapons then the british government is culpable because of their inactivity
110932 theres another question why arent they going after weapons now when they might have evidence relevant to a murder case i think the psni is left completely open to legal action on this
110933 this is a drug that is like pharmacological exercise we were blown away after four weeks of receiving the drug the mice were behaving as if they had been exercised

110949 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
110950 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
110951 but you take little bits but he has seen and done everything and i have tried to learn from the way he never panics
110952 he just takes his time and makes a decision and sticks by it
110953 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
110954 it was pure instinct i had never even done it in practice i was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball so i didnt know it was going in thankfully it did
110955 funnily enough we had done something very similar to liverpool in the fa cup earlier that season and i got the winner then so while we were surprised to beat bayern it wasnt a shock that we achieved it in the way we did
110956 three years before i came on as a substitute in the fa cup final against millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for united
110957 i knew i needed another operation and i just felt that would be it
110958 yes i am very happy with his presence but i dont want to talk a lot about the olympic squad because that is the job work of sergio batista
110959 checho batista and i work together and speak a lot but he makes all the decisions with regards to the under 23 team
110960 the players are as desperate for success as the manager and the fans
110961 that is the type of thing that spurs us on and in this game success can breed success
110962 the club is moving forward and the time is right for success
110963 the aim at this moment in time is the same as it is every season and that is to win something
110964 i have been at everton for more than half my life now and it would be fantastic to win something with the first team
110965 we really thought we could do something last season and i was convinced that we would win the carling cup even after the first leg defeat against chelsea in the semi final
110966 but it just was not to be and the same goes for the uefa cup when we were more than a little unfortunate
110967 when mikel arteta scored against fiorentina at goodison to bring the tie level on aggregate i could not see any other outcome than an everton victory
110968 we were playing brilliantly and the atmosphere was incredible i thought it was all set up for a memorable night
110969 it was soul destroying in the end but we have had a taste now and we are looking forward to doing even better this time around
110970 i was a regular in the reserve team that won the league a few years back as was tony hibbert and the feeling of satisfaction at the end of a season when you have got a winners medal in your hand was tremendous
110971 every new season is exciting and this season again we will be bringing in new players new faces
110972 i have a lot of confidence in the squad and my opinion is that every season we are improving a little bit and this time it will be the same
110973 this is the best squad i have had since i arrived at liverpool we are looking for players to improve our weaknesses and we have found some of them
110974 i share jamie carraghers opinion that we must challenge for the title right to the end
110975 when i was at valencia we had barcelona and real madrid to challenge and they were both in the top five in europe
110976 nobody then was talking about valencia winning the title people talked of us maybe finishing in the top four
110977 but we won the title twice and we won the uefa cup that means that sometimes you do not need to talk too much but to do things on the pitch
110978 we want to be contenders but we also know that our rivals are also improving
110979 so we are doing our job to improve the squad and challenge clubs people think are bigger and richer
110980 we can get closer than before and i repeat in valencia nobody was talking about my team doing anything but we won the title twice
110981 here i have the same idea we will try to progress improve get the points and then see what the situation is
110982 we have enough confidence and we will try to do it
110983 i know what liverpool fans want but we will be better than last season because there will be a greater understanding between the players who have arrived in recent seasons
110984 we must improve work harder than before and then try to be as close as possible
110985 we have got closer so why not improve some more and do something really important
110986 our aim is to win every trophy but the order is premier league champions league fa cup and carling cup
110987 when i arrived here it was extremely difficult because some teams were spending a lot of money and they have continued to do that
110988 our aim is to improve our squad every season with new senior players and to also improve the reserve team
110989 last season we won the reserve league with a lot of young players and they will be the future for the club
110990 all our supporters know we needed to improve in the wide areas that is why we have brought in philipp degen and andrea dossena who are both offensive full backs who can go forward
110991 that will give our strikers greater options because the full backs will both be going forward
110992 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
110993 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
110994 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
110995 i dont want to reveal details but on monday i will introduce my ideas to the players about how i would like mexico to play every match
110996 im swede not mexican and its easy to me if a player has a mexican passport has talent and plays well i will call him up
110997 if the federation limit me then i will get used to that
110998 ive been given good news about carlos velas recent form
110999 there were times when we thought that was it for sure we had two crunch games against sunderland and derby
111000 after we drew with derby there was a sense of deflation having been up 2 1
111001 roy hodgson was great then because he was telling us that there was time and plenty of games and to have the belief
111002 a lot of players were like come on lets get real but he was right he never stopped working with us
111003 when we were 2 0 down to manchester city i truly thought we were down but we came back to win that game in the last minute and the rest is history
111004 it was a fantastic end to a poor season but we cant expect to do what we did again
111005 the reason you are down in the bottom three is because you have been losing more games than you should be
111006 that makes the fans unhappy as well as the players and everyone around the club
111007 you want to be playing for a club where everyone is looking forward to the next game with a spring in their step
111008 youve got every type of specialist there and i think that roy has added some of the things that he learnt from managing abroad
111009 the premier league has caught up now but the foreign leagues were the first to do it all
111010 even if these things only bring you two percent they are worth it because that can mean surviving or not
111011 realistically i dont think that you can be too crazy in your ambition so middle table mediocrity would be nice in comparison to last season
111012 i think to aim to go from almost being relegated to a european place is bit of a jump you need to build a solid base
111013 we are aware we were in the bottom three because we werent good enough and we are addressing that by bringing in new players
111014 despite the position of goias in the standings they are a good team and it was a very difficult match that we won thanks to a good aerial ball
111015 the team played very well and most importantly we escaped from the relegation zone
111016 there was huge pressure on us and now we must work hard to stay out of there

111024 we started planting when the rains were supposed to come in march but then it never rained so all the seeds rotted
111025 my ox died because i couldnt feed it and now i cant plough this land quick enough to plant more maize i will have to sell everything off to buy food but then i dont know how i will feed everyone after that
111026 were worried what will happen if the rations go down any further
111027 this is the most desperate situation i have ever seen
111028 you can see that many people here are very ill from food shortages those most severely affected children are now getting help but the number of malnourished children is growing all the time and this is a real concern
111029 many babies have already died here and i think many more will die in the months to come not only children but also adults are becoming very weak nobody has anything to eat at all
111030 there have been vast improvements made here especially when you consider that this year we are facing a myriad of problems that is making the situation very difficult to handle
111031 its simple economics people dont have enough money to buy the food they need

111091 this book explains how beauty drives the computer revolution how lust for beauty and elegance underpinned the most important discoveries in computational history and continues to push research onward today
111092 both hardware and software should afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve deep beauty the kind of beauty that happens when many types of loveliness reinforce one another when design expresses an underlying technology a machine logic these principles beautiful in themselves will set the stage for the next technological revolution in which the pursuit of elegance will lead to extraordinary innovations

111342 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
111343 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
111344 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
111345 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close
111346 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
111347 i dont know what to do its so disappointing that i cant post something low it seems like i cant play 18 holes
111348 on the 17th tee i got really mad a bad drive off the tee and i didnt hit a good chip
111349 but the rest i have no complaints i think the first day im not worried
111350 the prosecution is sending a warning that while some things might be tolerated in sports other actions wont be tolerated
111351 but the crown is saying this level of violence is considered reprehensible and prohibited on or off the ice and there are norms that shouldnt be surpassed
111352 china is going to be one of the most historically important games ever
111353 to be able to be part of that whichever way it turns out good or bad i think its going to be amazing
111354 its a controversial place and they put the games in a situation where they are drawing attention to certain things both good and bad using the games as kind of china opening up for the rest of the world is going to be really significant
111355 our interest will be in watching how the chinese organizing committee performs against any kind of adversity it might face
111356 we will obviously be interested in things like traffic control management crowd control doping control the operations of the villages how the venues will be managed
111357 i think it will be one of the most popular sports at the olympic games
111358 you just start coughing a bit more you get little chunkies in your throat
111359 oh dont worry we met some american missionaries yesterday who we repeated a prayer with and so we know were going to heaven
111360 it was seven years before carey baptised his first convert in india it was seven years before judson won his first disciple in burma morrison toiled seven years before the chinaman was brought to christ moffat declares that he waited seven years to see the first evident moving of the holy spirit upon his bechuanas of africa henry richards wrought seven years on the congo before the first convert was gained at banza manteka
111361 would you like to pray and ask jesus into your heart now it will only take three minutes
111362 i would be surprised if someone made a change without at least informing
111363 but i really do not know the detail i only know the ground rules on censorship have changed but have only been announced here it must have related to a former understanding to which i was not a party
111364 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
111365 were working with the organizers to understand what the issues are here
111366 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
111367 i really believe that you go out there set that kind of example day in and day out and keep it together
111368 not to say that they were wrong or anything its just that thats the way the game is you cant ride the ups and downs with this game or it will kill you
111369 i dont make anything of it i know where it came from
111370 ive played this game a long time i know whats going on
111371 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
111372 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
111373 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
111374 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
111375 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
111376 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
111377 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
111378 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
111379 china is going to be one of the most historically important games ever
111380 to be able to be part of that whichever way it turns out good or bad i think its going to be amazing
111381 its a controversial place and they put the games in a situation where they are drawing attention to certain things both good and bad using the games as kind of china opening up for the rest of the world is going to be really significant
111382 our interest will be in watching how the chinese organizing committee performs against any kind of adversity it might face
111383 we will obviously be interested in things like traffic control management crowd control doping control the operations of the villages how the venues will be managed
111384 i think if you hand out the money prior to get the athlete in the position to earn the prize at the end then maybe it makes more sense
111385 you can give us as much money as you want in the end but we need it a year ago
111386 i think it will be one of the most popular sports at the olympic games
111387 you just start coughing a bit more you get little chunkies in your throat
111388 its certainly in my event going to be a war of attrition dead man walking by the end of it
111389 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
111390 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
111391 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
111392 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
111393 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
111394 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
111395 its good you should read it go and buy it
111396 ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months
111397 and this gives us a chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch

111406 graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years
111407 some people think they have acne many people may have pimples from it and the difference is there are no black heads associated redness and very often spider veins
111408 there are certain types of food people ingest alcohol that causes flushing and flushing causes redness and permanent dilation of the blood vessels or spider veins
111409 this is not an increase to make more money this is an increase to cover the extra costs of the items that you buy
111410 at the beginning of january february i lost about 40 percent from april it started going to 50 to 60 percent
111411 the prices that farmers are getting for their corn or soybean or wheat are rising sharply but then that filters through into the wholesale and manufacturing level for bakeries and food companies that make everything from cheese to bread and it factors into the restaurant and to the retail level
111412 were not talking about the increased price of dairy or the cost of the gasoline thats gone up for our drivers or for the new cost of paper supplies all these other things
111413 im talking literally flour the increase in flour is 11 000 a week more right now so all year long before we raised the prices we just were swallowing that
111414 were busy but were just not breaking even at all
111415 so were hoping that this price increase i mean its a little bit too little too late but at least it will help us to make it through the year and sort of get back on our feet afterwards
111416 i would say that things will get worse in terms of food price cost over the next 12 months
111417 i think if you go out 24 36 months two or three years from now you may see some improvement
111418 well i havent really thought about it too much it was just on my mind
111419 father and son are two persons acting simultaneously with one mind both with joy and pain

111421 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings
111422 abuses his position of influence derived from his reputation as a mountaineer to recruit students at schools for jeremy smith
111423 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
111424 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea
111425 thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie
111426 todays verdict is vindication for a project which has had to endure the appalling and completely unjustified stigma cast by the abc for more than a decade
111427 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
111428 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
111429 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
111430 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
111431 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
111432 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
111433 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
111434 the vote you will cast for directors is the most important for stockholders in our history
111435 yangs vision is not clear unless he can inject some real confidence into the room unless he can come up with something new that takes us on from microsoft you will start to see between 5 and 10 per cent revenue dilution
111436 the potential of a microsoft purchase still remains a possibility especially with carl icahn now on the board leaving doors open for another possible bid
111437 een substanti le rol voor de onderhandelaars van de deelstaten

111442 dat het kartel cd amp v n va de stekker er niet wil uittrekken heeft enkel te maken met angst om bij verkiezingen zetels te verliezen
111443 daarmee kunnen ze zich verder kwijten van hun belangrijkste taak die ze met bravoure vervullen het zorgen voor een rustige vakantie voor de politieke kopstukken zij kunnen zich nog eens omdraaien op hun strandlaken
111444 wij werken met open vragen mensen moeten zelf aangeven wat hun grootste bekommernis is

111446 de leiding van ons reisbureau heeft onlangs contact gehad met de dunya oogkliniek en heeft er een contract kunnen sluiten om vanuit heusden reizen te organiseren naar turkije

111451 bij de afdaling van de sch nbichlerhorn zagen we een gewonde vrouw op de grond liggen ze bloedde hevig en haar enkel was gebroken
111452 mijn vrouw is verpleegster en diende de eerste hulp toe we belden de reddingsdiensten en leiden de helikopter met lichtkogels naar onze locatie
111453 stien reageerde heel nuchter en diende meteen de eerste zorgen toe
111454 we hadden samen met lieve briers 34 en 34 en tim bamelis uit maasmechelen woensdag de top van de sch nbichlerhorn behaald toen we afdaalden kwamen we andere bergbeklimmers tegen een vrouw lag kreunend op de grond haar voet was bij de afdaling klem geraakt en dan is ze nog eens gevallen hierdoor brak ze haar enkel haar voet stond helemaal in de verkeerde richting en ze bloedde hevig haar broek was doordrenkt
111455 wij zijn dan wat lager gegaan en hebben de hulpdiensten gebeld het duurde niet lang of de helikopter was daar

111458 in 2005 lag de hoeve nog in het kleinstedelijk gebied
111459 ik wil er op wijzen dat moers toen schepen van ruimtelijke ordening was door mysterieuze machinaties op de provincie is midden vorig jaar de afbakening hertekend waardoor de hoeve plots buiten de stadsgrenzen ligt zonder dat er enig overleg is geweest met de stad opvallend is dat ook moers hier zeer goed over ge nformeerd is omdat hij beroepsmatig deel uitmaakt van de administratie

111464 in as much as the asa has tried to make every effort to keep fees at a minimum and static this is not financially possible so we are compelled to institute an increase currently the administration costs outweigh the fees we charge parties when filing a complaint on appeal the successful party is generally refunded a portion of their appeal fee which then leaves us shouldering part of the costs
111465 the alternative for complaints is to go to court which is a lot more expensive
111466 debates are becoming far more intensive legally this and the changing legal environment requires greater use of legal experts to chair hearings and write up rulings

111483 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist he said
111484 no one has lost a foot and no one has lost fingers it is not correct

111495 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
111496 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
111497 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
111498 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
111499 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously
111500 we were having quite a few conversations and some of them were initiated by other teams who wanted our young players
111501 some of the names you saw traded some of those calls came to us
111502 we really want to see it through and stay disciplined
111503 we have a real foundation and were willing to bite the bullet the process is painful and were not going to do something to make everyone feel better for the next couple of weeks we have a long term plan which is why we made the trades we did before the deadline
111504 my focus here on out is to finish strong finish these last two months in a positive way
111505 and also put up numbers that are indicative of where i believe myself to be you cant focus on what youve done in the past because you cant change it

111507 today on the countryside it was a hotter than a crotch
111508 in the bullpen if i pitched poorly i always felt better if i had a day off to see what i was doing wrong
111509 lets say you have mechanical problems and youre not throwing a certain pitch the way you want to if you dont have time to make the adjustment you go out there two or three or four outings in a row you get your butt kicked whereas as a starter you have a few days to look it over and work on it
111510 i mean i want to get back out there obviously because my last outing wasnt what i was hoping for
111511 but its not like im sitting in here saying oh my god i cant wait to pitch again when my time comes my time comes

111516 eerder deze week bleek uit cbs cijfers dat de nederlander zijn vertrouwen in de economie helemaal kwijt is
111517 today on the countryside it was a hotter than a crotch
111518 the cbsa constantly takes steps including outreach and training to ensure our services are not discriminatory or perceived to be discriminatory
111519 we feel that this is a type of profiling which must cease

111537 the tight integration of omnibus itx and hp hardware creates a compelling solution that can outstrip the capabilities of conventional systems and set new benchmarks for time to market and return on investment
111538 were obviously looking at all options because that would mean if we maintain our present policy with stadia we would have a very crowded mcg and telstra dome
111539 we cant play any more games at skilled stadium so one option obviously is to play as many games at telstra dome and the mcg or to have a look at another option which could be a boutique stadium
111540 obviously one option is a boutique stadium that might hold 26 to 28 games with a capacity of 25 000 people
111541 were just doing the work now we discussed it with the club ceos at a conference we had yesterday and the day before
111542 we basically said to them that we understand that the stadium economics isnt working for the clubs in melbourne that we need to try and get a better return out of the mcg and telstra dome for them
111543 and down the track if and when we introduce the two teams in 2011 and 2012 there could be if we go to 24 rounds an extra 40 games and about 26 or 28 of those could be in melbourne
111544 they certainly want to be there at the table if and when we decide we might go further or there might be a victorian club thats interested in relocating
111545 we think its terribly important that tasmania puts their bid in
111546 i think tasmania could play an integral role in our national competition and theyve got a rich history of football theyre very decent people theyve served us very well with the relationship with hawthorn theyve invested in york park in launceston
111547 at a point in time why not what happens down the track with tasmania thats up for grabs and its all the more reason why they should be getting their bid together

111560 its a trend we were seeing many science centers across the country do
111561 weve been getting more and more calls as more and more hollywood films are getting released in the imax format and weve always tried to react to what our audiences are looking for
111562 we know that people come here to see those mission based films the classic travelogue films that are high in science content those films are increasingly expensive to make
111563 helps us keep the legacy alive with these mission films
111564 we had a multimillion dollar bond that we used to pay for that project
111565 people demand to see these movies in the imax format
111566 the quality is higher and its a much more immersive experience
111567 that chain may have the right to prevent a film from showing at least on the opening day
111568 we have continued to have a lot of calls about the dark knight
111569 but the decision here was that we wanted to try and stay with the films that relate to our core audience the films rating didnt match what we were trying to do here
111570 thats a lack of preparation from nascar to goodyear to the indianapolis motor speedway to put on a show like that
111571 i dont think you can put 100 percent of the blame on goodyear for this one
111572 was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career
111573 we dont like to see anybodys day ruined because of our tires
111574 the lean of the tires helps the car turn through the corners
111575 but on a straightaway a lot of camber is fairly abusive on the tires because youre riding on the shoulder of the tires a long way while the tread makes less contact with the racing surface
111576 everybodys trying to find every nook and cranny to go faster but to every decision that will move you forward on a racetrack there are potential consequences
111577 the rfid chip is very robust its smaller than the eraser on a pencil and its installed near the meatiest toughest part of the tire
111578 so were 100 percent certain when one of our tires is missing
111579 at that point i couldnt really tell where my body was going
111580 i feel rejuvenated i feel like im ready to play football again
111581 it allowed those defensive ends that were here to work their way through the practice and play fast
111582 it was just something id push through and push through and after a while it kind of goes downhill
111583 he looked like he was moving around well i heard him talking a few times which is always a good sign because he wasnt talking a lot the other day
111584 that is where it started to go bad were playing good so hopefully that is where it starts to go great
111585 were back to the way we need to be playing
111586 getting hits making plays making pitches and winning when we lost we were playing bad so the losses felt heavy we seem to be more focused on the next game when the game is over win or lose its about trying to go out and win that next game i think that has a lot to do with attitude
111587 i just think it was probably one of those things where he had that talk because of how we were playing
111588 i think slumps only last so long so i think everybody pulled out of it so if you want to say it was due to the talk or if you want to say it was due to the prolonged slumps coming to an end either way
111589 you definitely can have too many meetings but i felt like at that time it was needed of course we come out and go 5 1 thats good if we go 10 1 and lose a couple believe me ill have another meeting i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not
111590 which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
111591 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
111592 i said were not looking for that guy from seattle
111593 what were looking for is for you to use your instincts
111594 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
111595 every work is progressively faster the track should suit him perfectly
111596 between the 30 plus club and the defensive end situation and tight end situation i had to pull back on them we just didnt do the live periods we normally do in pads but we still got all the work done that needed to be done
111597 you talk to guys who come here from other teams and to guys you know around the league we do have a pretty hard camp
111598 ive heard from the veterans that this is one of the hardest camps in the nfl
111599 i think theres an adjustment period for new players in our system whether they are rookies or whether they are veteran guys we got through free agency
111600 its a little different here and in the end we all work toward making it a good environment for the player i think this is a tough tough thing that we do here
111601 you know im a defensive player so theres no such thing as too much hitting
111602 you dont want to hit your own guys all the time but i dont think its too much im a safety thats what i do
111603 i mean i dont want to cheap shot a guy like if theres a guy with his hands up im not going to try to decapitate him but at the same time thats how you get ready for the season the hitting
111604 it really doesnt matter to me i played for lou holtz in college
111605 some of my former teammates say they have better situations where they go
111606 of course some of those guys are on teams that arent very good look when you get in the games and youre not used to somebody hitting you more than likely youre going to fumble the football and stuff like that so you might as well get used to it
111607 everybody came out here together and its something ive always liked about haddonfield
111608 there is a sense of community here and you are always representing more than yourself
111609 my goals right now are to take it one round at a time get to the final in beijing and go from there
111610 im in good shape right now and i think im ready to run faster than 4 05
111611 i would definitely like to run a four flat or better in the next few years and i intend to keep competing through the next olympics
111612 the role hes in at the moment is sort of unfair to him
111613 we possibly are going to look at making an adjustment
111614 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
111615 well see you never know when hes going to get into a game we could put him in a game early and let him go like the other day when eaton came in if a guy gets knocked out in the second or third inning he could pitch four or five innings getting him work is the big thing keeping him sharp
111616 hes a much better defensive player than i remember seeing he gets a big hit for you every now and then
111617 will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home
111618 itll also be the last chance for others who may have never seen the flyers play at the spectrum it will be a highly emotional game for me personally
111619 have a 100 percent graduation rate and the atmosphere that coach wright and his coaching staff have is great
111620 coach wright is honest he just wants the best for his players and the family atmosphere he creates is something you cant find anywhere else
111621 get better in the classroom and on the basketball court
111622 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
111623 removing the record is the right thing to do pure and simple
111624 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
111625 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
111626 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
111627 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
111628 it could be a while before the investigation comes to a conclusion
111629 we got agreement from one club and they were trying to get agreement on players from the other club
111630 we were involved we couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be
111631 its just that weve got to please our club a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that and we just thought maybe that was a little too rich of an ask for us
111632 i think the pitching is always a concern if our position players perform as we anticipate or have performed in the past offensively and defensively we should have no problem weve got to be more consistent from a pitching standpoint and an offensive standpoint just to maintain some sort of consistency
111633 you can see that he had a lot of interceptions in college and you always want to see if that carries over to the pro game
111634 in these practices you see him getting his hands on the ball and making catches
111635 that makes him a valuable guy if he can continue to improve in those areas
111636 asante is a little bit away but hes getting closer
111637 they get in and normally work out a little bit hit the tubs get a little extra sleep
111638 theyre not just lying around these guys are a little older now and this is helping them and ill keep it going
111639 i think when youre in the dryer kind of going around and around you dont worry about all that stuff thats not what we worry about here and i know there are issues im sure theyre saying if brett shows up brett shows up i think mike
111640 this is your period this is not a jog through
111641 were concentrating on turnovers so lets get turnovers i care about the ball in the air
111642 got into online racing about a year and a half ago and actually thats how i met him
111643 he goes three wide at talladega at 300 miles an hour
111644 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
111645 i think people outside view it as a struggle but we look at it as a great opportunity
111646 there have been some voices that havent been heard on our team
111647 i think the big thing this summer is we will have another opportunity of earning their own fame
111648 we needed to change our game we needed new ideas and pia was perfect for us
111649 id be lying if i told you 6 years ago that i would have envisioned 100 000 people on market street and helicopters flying overhead
111650 someones got to stand up and be the conductor and im more than glad to do it
111651 i want to give back to the community like jon bon jovi gives back
111652 this is incredible to me im in a minor state of shock
111653 id be surprised if theres any other city that has won an arena championship and had something like this this is unbelievable
111654 youre dealing with a smart guy there that gives you a little flexibility with what you can do with hank
111655 hes playing very well right now and hes catching the ball real well were seeing him go up and the quarterbacks just put the ball up hes covered they put the ball up and he goes and gets the thing he can about jump out of the house hes got a great vertical jump and hes utilizing that better he looks to me stronger than what hes been in the past and hes got that big body to go with it hes playing very well right now
111656 definitely the sizewise big receiver but there was a lot of talk in the offseason outside the organization about that one go to guy
111657 any position you have that one key player things happen in this league all the time something happens to that one player then what
111658 id much rather have a team full of guys where if kevin curtis needs a blow or reggie brown needs a blow theyre confident that we can go in and make plays
111659 last year i wasnt going up and attacking the ball like i was the year before thats one thing ive tried to come back and do coach reid got on me a couple of times in the offseason about not going up and getting the ball thats what ive been focusing on this camp
111660 like he told me today there was a catch in the red zone hes like thats what you do you use your body
111661 this year ive lost the weight i feel quicker i feel healthier ive just been focusing on the few little things i sort of overlooked last year in camp
111662 we werent very good in the red zone last season
111663 we were very good in many other factors of the game but that red zone was not good that starts with me we always change if somethings wrong were going to fix it and we did that throughout the season and thought we had it clicking there about midseason and then we reverted back and so yes weve done many things there to improve our red zone production
111664 hes a big physical man who does quite a few different things for us and that certainly is one of them
111665 still a little bit away but hes getting closer here
111666 i was raising to thin the field and mix it up
111667 i didnt want to always limp in under the gun
111668 theres a good chance that my hands good but i had some short stacks behind me and i thought there was a good chance one of them might shove
111669 i think raymond has a small pocket pair he was in the blind and just the way he was acting i felt like if he had a 7 he wouldve tried to maximize it tried to check raise or lead out more i think he was trying to protect his underpair and didnt bet out enough when the guy on the button called i had no idea what he had
111670 you cant be scared because an overcard hits the board like that on the river because it wouldnt have made any sense for someone to be holding it at that point
111671 why would anybody have a 10 in their hand at that point and not have bet it earlier if it were a pair it doesnt fit the equation if it doesnt make sense then you need to maximize value and get a bet out there
111672 we were involved we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be so it was just one of those things
111673 we could please other clubs its just the fact that weve got to please ourselves a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that we just thought that maybe it was just a little bit too rich an ask for us
111674 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
111675 i think its good for the game all of the attention
111676 hes just not dealing with the same set of cards he had in spring training
111677 this is the team paying me a lot of money and this is where i want to be
111678 i hate to be put in this situation and now i look like a bad guy again
111679 theyve just got to pitch better they should be able to do better
111680 theyre not sandy koufax and don drysdale but theyre not a ball pitchers either
111681 i hate players who make 100 million and feel sorry for themselves when my dad still has to work
111682 were normally stockpiled at defensive line and we wouldnt be in this type of situation but thats what it is right now and you move on with it
111683 if you have to make a little adjustment like we did this morning its no big deal we still got a lot taught and at the same time the guys will come out and put the pads back on today and be ready to go you even get a little bit more fire out of them than you would have if you banged them today
111684 i remember parts of practice and i remember sitting there getting water thrown on me
111685 once i got to the hospital i was fine it was one of those things where i couldnt tell what my body was doing
111686 the thing about it is your mind is just rambling everywhere you just feel like youre out of breath
111687 but then you really dont want to make anything worse youve got to be smart and let the trainers do their job if you do what they say eventually youll go back out there
111688 im looking real forward to being back in pads make some tackles make some plays
111689 the losses to the mets might have shaken us up a little bit
111690 weve got veterans in here and nobody likes to lose especially the mets but i still think we were just kind of in a lull offensively there for awhile
111691 definitely after the first two games we wanted to come here and get a sweep it was huge for us to win tonight it was a big win
111692 six and two third innings 110 pitches he did ok
111693 if philadelphia really understood his value to that team they would never even have allowed him to get upset with his contract you take westbrook off that team and nobody would fear them i dont think they truly understand that
111694 youve got to game plan against him youve got to know where he is every play as a defensive end the things that we do change when hes in the football game when youve got a player on your team like that you have to take care of him
111695 he should be one of the highest paid players in the league period im not saying this as a friend of his i dont even know the guy that well im just saying it because its the truth
111696 tiki couldve played a couple more years at a high level i think
111697 its a young mans game though i do know that
111698 i was hoping to get 3 years out of him we ended up getting 5 he kept himself in excellent shape in his entire 15 year career he had just one minor arthroscopy to his knee
111699 he knew when to get down and avoid the big hit he had terrific peripheral vision former raiders coach art shell used to call him horse eyes he could anticipate the hit coming
111700 guys come at him from all angles but hes very good at avoiding the harsh hits
111701 thats because hes smart about the way he runs and because he has great vision also because hes short in stature hes 5 8 he has great body lean and body awareness its really hard for a tackler to get under him
111702 i dont know who you could compare him to in that respect maybe walter payton he never took a lot of big hits either
111703 brian does it almost by going sideways past tacklers he is without question the best athlete ive ever coached its so hard to describe his athleticism but when you see it you know it wow maybe thats the word wow
111704 you always wonder when a guy is going to hit the wall
111705 with older players youre always rolling the dice you always want to try to reward the guys that have been good players good soldiers for you
111706 sometimes guys slowly decline and sometimes its just a free fall you look at the stats to help you but the stats will lie to you sometimes
111707 there are guys that have done it been productive after theyve turned 30
111708 can they continue to do it thats the question im hoping i can
111709 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
111710 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
111711 hes a cute little fella he doesnt throw that hard and he doesnt have very good stuff i love facing him he doesnt have many out pitches he should be fortunate hes in the big leagues
111712 it can be pretty intoxicating knowing youre going after history out there it can give you a little more adrenaline
111713 people that want to say things like that all im going to say is that in japanese professional baseball they dont use metal bats
111714 there are going to be criticisms entering this tournament but at the same time im just doing what i feel like i want to do and its going to be a lot of fun
111715 its a good deal for louis it gives him a chance to grow with a team thats building and allows him to stay with the team he came into the nba with
111716 he got player of the game i voted for him twice
111717 this is such a great promotion by you guys and for the phillies too
111718 i have already had friends call me and tell me they heard my name on the radio asking how they can get involved
111719 right now im not really sure im still in a state of shock i think ill use some of the money to take my parents to a game
111720 the asking price for us was pretty steep so i suspect thats the reason those people didnt move
111721 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
111722 we can go fight it out with those other two teams
111723 if one of those teams had made a big deal it could definitely have made them the strongest team i think all three of us will be pretty even
111724 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
111725 but like i said wednesday i look at happ as a starter
111726 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
111727 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
111728 i cant see any kind of issue with him in any way he just looks good as he can possibly look its all good with him right now
111729 if big brown finishes the haskell the right way im going to forget about trying to figure the belmont out
111730 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore a whole lot depends on what happens sunday
111731 the breeders cup is definitely on top of the list even though you know this race here is more important than any race for him right now
111732 whatever happened in the belmont i dont feel that its my fault
111733 i dont feel i did anything wrong i know the horse went into the race very very good
111734 the amount of races hes won in all three divisions you pray for a season like that im happy to be close to him im proud hes done it hes worked hard and the result show
111735 its been a while since weve seen anyone in this series have this type of season
111736 dominant is the word i would use even weeks that it looks like they might not win he found a way to get back to victory lane hes just a phenomenal talent
111737 a lot of people wondered what would happen to a young mans confidence whenever hes released from a high profile team
111738 on the race track even though he looks like hes totally out of control most times hes obviously in control
111739 hes able to drive that car with a freer motion than what the other drivers do thats a big key to why hes winning hes able to get the car through the center because hes able to drive it in the corner a little looser its just a feel that he has that no one else does
111740 youve seen the maturity on and off the race track
111741 were seeing a young man who is very comfortable with who he is i dont know that this would have happened a few years ago i dont know that he would have been able to handle all the success that hes having
111742 and its very gratifying as well youve got to stay humble and stay hungry
111743 ultimately every driver wants to be known as the best ever its an awfully hard task to do youve got the king richard petty youve got dale earnhardt and youve got all those guys that have made the sport what it is
111744 hes developing a midrange game and can shoot the ball from the three point line and hes a very strong defensive player
111745 i think he shoots it a little better than gerald at this point
111746 in my 5 years we have 22 alumni who are playing college basketball on scholarship the most notable one is luc richard mbah a moute

111751 well right now i know im in a good position not because roger has to win everything from here from the olympics to the us open

111765 bad personnel decisions have haunted the bush administration and one of the bigger disappointments is federal communications commission chairman kevin martin in his last months as master of the media universe he seems poised to expand government regulation of the internet
111766 it appears to reverse a decade old bipartisan policy against regulation of the internet
111767 t he internet has flourished because it has operated under the principle that engineers not politicians or bureaucrats should solve engineering problems
111768 the fccs job is not to determine business models in the private sector the community of internet service and content providers has proven itself more than able to work out problems on its own as web use has exploded
111769 will incessantly petition the fcc to review each and every business model decision and encourage the unelected bureaucrats at the agency to manage the internet to their hearts content

111796 it is about informing the world that africa has much to offer that our people are ready to receive the world ready to host those who come to the world cup
111797 crime is a problem and the government is training 30 000 new police officers specifically for the world cup
111798 but it is taken out of all proportion 99 9 percent of people who live in south africa whatever their race colour or creed are beautiful people but 0 1 percent like anywhere in the world are very bad

111814 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
111815 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
111816 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the us 100 to us 110 range
111817 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
111818 for me superleague formula is a dream come true joining motor racing and football the two sports that i love the most
111819 knowing that my racing team will run in the colors of my club and to be able to share this challenge with my friend francesco totti is just fantastic
111820 when giancarlo called me to confirm that i would be the as roma race car driver i couldnt believe it
111821 me and giancarlo have always been friends and have always shared the same strong passion towards motorsport as roma is the team i love the most and i usually follow most of their matches on tv now the players will be supporting me that is incredible

111829 now from anecdotal evidence young adult fiction is the fastest growing genre
111830 what authors are able to say now is so much broader
111831 before it was elaborate chapter books now you have things like mercedes lackey writing about gay love
111832 there was realistic fiction in the days of the baby sitters club but reality now is different the growing sophistication of the literature parallels the sophistication that you see in teens that you talk to

111837 we are going to look again at the logistics operation for the coventry store and will be moving away from having night shifts
111838 when you open a new store you always look at various aspects such as volume and what is effective and we believe it will be best to operate only in the day
111839 in coventry we cannot offload between 11pm and 6am because of restrictions imposed by the council
111840 we thought we could work around this but six months after opening the store we realised that the night shift was not cost effective nor efficient
111841 we have found that there is a three to four hour window before the store opens when the work can be done and also when the store is closed
111842 the plan is not to lose anybody there will be no redundancies as there will be jobs for everyone in the day
111843 we still have the work to do but it will just be done at a different time

111897 i pointed out his illness was not standard procedure and he was struggling to come to terms with the illness he was frightened and distressed
111898 after many stressful months he wished to remain working even though suffering from such a serious illness
111899 none of the issues he raised were accepted or dealt with

111902 context collapse an infinite number of contexts collapsing upon one another into that single moment of recording the images actions and words captured by the lens at any moment can be transported to anywhere on the planet and preserved the performer must assume for all time the little glass lens becomes the gateway to a blackhole sucking all of time and space virtually all possible contexts in upon itself

112031 climate change is expected to increase a broad range of risks to the health of canadians

112039 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
112040 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
112041 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
112042 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
112043 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
112044 the madness of trying to maintain endless economic growth in a world with finite resources
112045 coal is basically the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel and with the rising oil prices having an effect on gas prices there is a clear financial incentive for businesses to switch back to coal for generating power

112080 powerful imagery which speaks intimately to its audience was needed for the campaign materials and the ethical agency and marcus lyon have delivered this in abundance

112082 to be asked to raise such an important issue among people with learning difficulties was a great brief and to do it we hope without being patronising or exploitative
112083 meeting the people who were our models was life affirming they were a terrific bunch of people who were really up for the campaign and wed like to thank them for helping us to see people with learning difficulties as wonderful complex human beings

112100 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute

112120 i feel like ive been hearing about these guys since i was nine years old and i sense the same feeling in the audience when i talk about them in my act theyre wearing people out and the fact all they talk about is stuff theyre going to do when the country need things done now is appalling its appalling why dont they talk about what they would have done if it was yesterday

112157 that people can take my song and make it their own i think for a songwriter to find any worth in his craft he first has to give it away people are honest theyll let you know if you are reaching them or not
112158 i decided that i cant put my faith in man
112159 i found an old photograph of a person that i hadnt seen in a long time there was some hurt that came along with the memory of that person looking at the picture it inspired me to write a song about forgiveness i was able to speak my heart through the song and move on in the freedom of forgiveness this is a personal song and i wasnt sure if i wanted to put it on the record now that i have im glad that i did

112164 a mio avviso si tratta di un vero e proprio attentato alla costituzione in quanto lart 3 sancisce luguaglianza dei cittadini ora nelle aule di tribunale accanto alla scritta la legge uguale per tutti dovremmo aggiungere salvo le note eccezioni sembra incredibile come di fronte ad un paese che annaspa in un mare di difficolt si sia data immediatamente la priorit ad un provvedimento di questo tipo penso che oggettivamente alla stragrande maggioranza degli italiani fatta eccezione per il cittadino berlusconi poco importi della presenza o meno del lodo alfano nel gi corposo elenco legislativo

112234 les libert s publiques ne sont pas autre chose que des r sistances
112235 the only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way
112236 o estado a grande fic o atrav s da qual todo mundo se esfor a para viver s custas de todo mundo
112237 even after the collapse of the negotiations stock markets in the world rose moderately
112238 i have doubted if past wto discussions would have any great impact on the world economy
112239 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade we expect to triple our circulation
112240 if north korea were to end up with a nuclear weapon it would be very destabilizing and very troubling for all of us
112241 its much more likely a chinese leader will listen to my concerns if he knows i respect the people of china
112242 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
112243 what is quite clear is that lucas is determined to stop mr ainsworth by whatever legitimate legal means are open to it including the threat of a 10m judgement hanging over him
112244 chavs come from far and wide to worship at the pikey temple that is the whitgift shopping centre a place that has more mcdonalds kfcs and burger kings than any other place on the planet many a chav family can be seen having their sunday lunch in one of these fine eateries
112245 however night time is when croydon really comes into its sic own the younger chavs are usually on their way home due to their curfew electronic tags time to feed the baby and this is when the older chavs i e 15 20 yr olds decide to descend on the croydon strip
112246 if anyone wants to see chavs in their natural environment and run the risk of getting mugged stabbed raped glassed shot or just plain dissed then come down to croydon its even got chav trams which are free to chavs
112247 i imagine half the people who took part in this survey havent been anywhere near croydon
112248 ive been to other places that could claim the title over croydon
112249 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
112250 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
112251 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
112252 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
112253 improper functioning of the subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
112254 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
112255 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings
112256 abuses his position of influence derived from his reputation as a mountaineer to recruit students at schools for jeremy smith
112257 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
112258 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea
112259 thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie
112260 todays verdict is vindication for a project which has had to endure the appalling and completely unjustified stigma cast by the abc for more than a decade
112261 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
112262 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
112263 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
112264 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
112265 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
112266 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
112267 the three party alliance must break up for the maoists to lead the next government
112268 the maoists shouldnt take the initiative in forming the government until there is a conducive atmosphere currently we dont have a majority to claim the right to form the government
112269 there may still be 10 15 students under the rubble
112270 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
112271 we are not going to join the government by putting the madhes agenda on hold instead we can play an active role in writing the new constitution by remaining in the opposition
112272 we shall try to continue this partnership and take along the pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n despite problems at the centre and punjab but without budging to any pressure tactics
112273 the ministers briefed zardari about the developments taking place in the last four five days like the re launching of a military operation in swat and hardened stance over the judges reinstatement with special focus on the current national political scenario
112274 its natural that companies are grabbing the chance to take advantage when the patriotic sentiment is at its peak
112275 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
112276 the rescue teams from secunderabad kazipet and vijaywada were immediately rushed to the spot and burning coaches were detached from the train
112277 we expect more bodies may be trapped under the charred bogies
112278 we were fast asleep suddenly we heard a commotion and i saw people running helter skelter there was fire in the bogie and it was spreading fast
112279 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
112280 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
112281 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
112282 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
112283 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
112284 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
112285 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
112286 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
112287 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
112288 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
112289 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
112290 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy
112291 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
112292 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
112293 clearly it was meant to suggest that he is not white hence a reference to race
112294 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
112295 obama used the race card against the clintons with great success now hes trying it with mccain
112296 voting for bho will not absolve aerican sic american of its racist sins past prejudices nor redeem the nation
112297 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
112298 might i remind you that its cost 1 25 cents to make 1 00 of ethanol
112299 insulted mccains war record even though clark prefaced that comment by stating that he respected mccains service
112300 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
112301 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
112302 oh his reverend was bitter and racist so he must be too
112303 the guy that sold him his house was involved with the mob so he must be too
112304 doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
112305 theyre going to try to scare you this that and by the way you know hes black
112306 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world has been waiting for
112307 using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
112308 ok ok now we are trying to harp on his inexperience
112309 hmmm well hes articulate an articulate well educated self made black man
112310 thats it we need the sluttiest stunted vocabulariest dumbest most ridiculed white girls we can find britney and paris brilliant
112311 whoa whoa whoa there sir you promised youd never say that word again or at least for the next 7 years
112312 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
112313 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
112314 obama would rather lose a war to win the vote
112315 it seems like youve just shoved this in with no thought or understanding
112316 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
112317 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
112318 how do you comb your hair why do you talk like that if you wash yourself long enough will you become white the children didnt mean to be rude or mean they just didnt know
112319 she just wanted to prove that she was like everybody else
112320 the board is acutely aware of the significant external risks presented by deteriorating economic conditions and continuing turbulence in financial markets
112321 against this background the proposal from santander provides greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
112322 has confirmed that mr robicheau is currently unfit and may well have been unfit when he entered his guilty pleas
112323 it is intended to increase the effectiveness of school board governance
112324 can be and are for the most part very effective
112325 as we have clearly seen in two recent cases boards can sometimes lose their focus become mired in bickering and lose their effectiveness as well as their respect for one another and the public
112326 the proposal now up for discussion introduces a number of intermediate disciplinary steps that i hope will address problems before i as the minister have to intervene
112327 what we are looking for is a level of self discipline by board members i want the board chair and the full board to be held accountable for the behaviour of their members
112328 in actual fact i think theyre giving power back to the boards so that they have in legislation a plan that they can use should board members be unruly and affect in a negative way the operations of the board
112329 its very difficult for a one person board to not appear to be draconian and dictatorial
112330 at least now the options there to replace it with a multi person board which should provide better input
112331 why would anyone want to run unless they wanted to be a rubber stamp
112332 would mean that the submariners would have 24 7 coverage for injury incurred during and arising out of service
112333 the incident has not been determined to be a special duty area
112334 however all members onboard the chicoutimi were considered on duty and all injuries considered attributable to service therefore they can apply for a disability award
112335 it removes the need to have a direct link between your disability and your service
112336 we got the result we wanted and progressed to the next round though it was a difficult evening at times
112337 streymur came with a damage limitation plan got plenty of people behind the ball and made it very difficult
112338 the balance of the game was overwhelming and we were never in danger even though they stuck at it well i am sure they enjoyed the experience and their fans got behind them
112339 overall i think we have the talent in the squad to ensure we have a decent run in the competition if we have beneficial cards dealt to us in terms of the draw i feel the clubs in the uefa cup are well matched
112340 in terms of new signings we are still looking at the options and i am delighted we have added ben haim to the squad and we will try and get him some game time at stockport
112341 i feel things are moving in the right direction for the big kick off on august 17 there are no other incoming transfers imminent but we are always looking to bring in quality players at the right price
112342 i want to have a look at the ones who didnt take part at barnsley
112343 that was always the plan it will be a completely different at county
112344 it has been some time since i wrote to investors directly but feel that recent events require some comment
112345 south canterbury finance ltd was incorporated in 1926 and apart from two years in the early nineteen thirties has traded profitably over these 82 years a feat that no other finance company in new zealand has achieved
112346 south canterbury finance ltds business is mainly concentrated on provincial lending
112347 it is intended to increase the effectiveness of school board governance
112348 can be and are for the most part very effective
112349 as we have clearly seen in two recent cases boards can sometimes lose their focus become mired in bickering and lose their effectiveness as well as their respect for one another and the public
112350 the proposal now up for discussion introduces a number of intermediate disciplinary steps that i hope will address problems before i as the minister have to intervene
112351 what we are looking for is a level of self discipline by board members i want the board chair and the full board to be held accountable for the behaviour of their members
112352 in actual fact i think theyre giving power back to the boards so that they have in legislation a plan that they can use should board members be unruly and affect in a negative way the operations of the board
112353 its very difficult for a one person board to not appear to be draconian and dictatorial
112354 at least now the options there to replace it with a multi person board which should provide better input
112355 why would anyone want to run unless they wanted to be a rubber stamp
112356 we have studied them thoroughly and have trained with the new laws but south africa will no doubt have an advantage in this respect
112357 we have a number of new players who are new to this level and we want to see how they shape up to the springboks for us this is an opportunity to measure their standard and one can also only improve if you compete against the best
112358 he wasnt married but his family meant everything to him
112359 you hear that a lot about people that are deceased but with him thats all you can say he was honourable and he was kind
112360 it appears up front that it was an accident and our poor good pat tried to help everybody out and get out of the way but there just wasnt enough time
112361 youve got a combined speed of 200 kilometres an hour and somebody hitting head on what for all intents and purposes is a brick wall thats not moving
112362 the van certainly made some evasive manoeuvres trying to get away but there seemed to be no evasive manoeuvre or attempt to correct itself on behalf of the car
112363 youd have to think the driver was distracted or something
112364 she came up the stairs and said look i live here
112365 she was allowed back in she was renting the place she lives there and it was no longer a crime scene
112366 ive had a number of neighbours call wanting to provide police statements supporting that we did indeed board the place up that we did indeed secure the place before we left were getting statements just in case we end up in court on this
112367 i get so much from this i perform and i spend time with students i see every day at school here we can enjoy each other in a relaxed situation
112368 the patients love this but this gives me a sense of self worth im doing something to make someone else happy
112369 assuming we can get a student grant or two to run it again
112370 natasha will do this again if we can get funding we really want to make this grow
112371 it bridges a gap between seniors and youth through music which all seniors love it makes the seniors feel good through music
112372 also helps us create awareness of what reachability does with agencies and caregivers we offer support for people with disabilities in areas where if they need help with various challenges the agencies will know who we are
112373 we can identify gaps and work with the community agencies to see how we can move forward
112374 i started singing celtic music when i was small as both my parents are from scotland and i sang with them
112375 my first performance was on cbc radio at age nine i started in science at dal but after a year switched to music because i knew performing is what i really wanted to do
112376 this is a new branch of outreach for reachability it shows how entertainment can have a positive affect on the seniors its often an overlooked area but music and entertainment is very important to them
112377 i remember standing there having a very spiritual feeling that i wished my grandmother was there
112378 i really felt strongly that i wanted my grandchildren to be standing there with me and that this was important family history
112379 i had to go up the family tree and down the tree
112380 we have very aggressive targets here in the province for greenhouse gas emissions
112381 were looking at all options were going to do an analysis on this and see if the benefits outweigh the costs
112382 its a good idea but i dont think itll work theres a lot easier ways to go about conserving
112383 one of the challenges is the fact that the government owns so few buildings of its own
112384 most government departments find themselves in private buildings which tend to house companies and other businesses so it would be pretty difficult to turn off the air conditioning in a building if youve still got four or five floors of a private company
112385 there are so many issues here that you have to look at
112386 theres private industries private businesses unions that you have to talk to
112387 gas prices are high and nova scotians are looking for more options
112388 its time for the nova scotia government to allow this alternative for shorter commuter trips
112389 across the country that would give an infusion of cash every single year
112390 it would turn it into an investment in a system that could help people get out of their car on occasion of course it also helps people who cant afford a car or who find the price of gas is getting higher and higher
112391 most canadians wouldnt even consider voting ndp so it truly is mythical
112392 it was a sleepover and it became just one more night just one more night
112393 after a while my friend made up with her parents and went home
112394 when summer ends when the line of couches ends what then
112395 if thats the case there should be no homeless youth
112396 im not very happy about it because it makes us look like the bad guys
112397 she came up the stairs and said look i live here
112398 she was allowed back in she was renting the place she lives there and it was no longer a crime scene
112399 ive had a number of neighbours call wanting to provide police statements supporting that we did indeed board the place up that we did indeed secure the place before we left were getting statements just in case we end up in court on this
112400 i dont think that we can afford not to do it
112401 i am unable to conclude that the punch thrown by jamie gregory meets the objective standards of the ordinary man
112402 his response was not proportional and did not comply with the standard of self control and restraint that is expected from all members of our society
112403 its like youre happy and sad at the same time
112404 is going to be with us for the rest of our lives
112405 i dont think there can ever be closure regardless of what the sentence is
112406 i have a lot of things to say but its all anger
112407 some time to reflect on what the judge said we will review his comments and decision and decide what our next step will be
112408 he was placed in a holding room to make a telephone call and at that point our officers became involved in an emergency situation with another prisoner who was threatening to harm himself
112409 mr stroud used that opportunity to exit the holding room hed been placed in and leave the booking area
112410 all the circumstances surrounding how it happened and whether or not policy was followed are actually under review by one of our staff sergeants to understand how this happened and to prevent it from happening in the future
112411 we would ask people not to approach him if they see him
112412 we waited for the drug transaction to occur on the street and then we moved in
112413 it was called operation halt and involved officers from the truro police drug enforcement unit the street crime unit rcmp and the dog units in truro and new glasgow
112414 weve been aware of what was going on through our investigation and we chose wednesday as the takedown day
112415 we chose three that were fairly well along in planning and much needed and as well very manageable for the government
112416 two of the things here that weve talked about a lot are on budget and on time
112417 and a big part of this is transfer of risk so the transfer of risk to the private sector when agreements are signed they would guarantee certain things and they would be obviously compensated based on their ability to meet those requirements
112418 where is it when can nova scotians expect this government to tell them what their plan is in terms of replacing that health care facility
112419 a competent government would be able to negotiate the question of risk in the normal procurement policy so i dont see the benefit to taxpayers from proceeding further through this process
112420 first and foremost are our concerns about quality access and safety when it comes to our highways
112421 i remember standing there having a very spiritual feeling that i wished my grandmother was there
112422 i really felt strongly that i wanted my grandchildren to be standing there with me and that this was important family history
112423 i had to go up the family tree and down the tree
112424 i got maulanas from barelvi deoband ahle hadees and shia schools of islam to talk about their respective sects policemen asked several interesting questions about the intricacies of islam
112425 it was a welcome exercise which i hope will help the police understand the muslim position on many issues confronting the community
112426 the hbaa annual forum is a vibrant and vocal arena for industry discussion and debate i cannot think of another event ever that will bring together senior representatives of every stage of the supply chain in such a thorough and comprehensive programme we look forward to welcoming members partners and representatives from corporate organisations to the 2008 forum to continue the hbaas objective of promoting professionalism in the industry
112427 ik heb de afgelopen jaren behoorlijk ge nvesteerd in mijn persoonlijke ontwikkeling door drie jaar in buitenlandse dienst te rijden bij de rabo ploeg wil ik me verder ontwikkelen
112428 voor de oppositie is het interessant omdat er veel actuele zaken rondom homoseksualiteit spelen die gevoelig liggen binnen de huidige coalitie pvda cda christenunie
112429 dat geweld komt in de grote steden vooral van allochtone jongeren
112430 en op het platteland van kaaskoppen de helft van de nederlandse bevolking vindt het afstotelijk om mannen met elkaar te zien zoenen
112431 de emancipatie van homos nog niet afgerond is het gaat om een authentieke strijd om vrijheid en gelijkheid dat raakt mij persoonlijk
112432 doordat hij het als een popster al lang van tevoren heeft aangekondigd heeft hij andere politici en bedrijven over de streep getrokken
112433 ik heb plasterk gebruikt als argument in de boardroom toen het erover ging of tnt het evenement zou gaan sponsoren
112434 dat plasterk daar ook meevaart kan bij het gros van de bevolking de indruk wekken dat hij juist op d t aspect een ministerieel stempel van goedkeuring zet daardoor kan zijn deelname als een boemerang op homos werken
112435 hij is dus niet alleen bij de extravaganza maar ook bij de loodzware discussies en de nette pakken
112436 brunei shell petroleums participation in this event is an extension of our social commitment to provide strong support to the governments economic diversification programme where the tourism sector has been earmarked as playing an important role both as the premier energy company and leading private corporation in the country brunei shell petroleum will continue to provide strong support for the governments efforts in this area
112437 besides contributing towards tourism marketing and promotional activities we also support the government on its parallel efforts to upgrade tourism infrastructure and develop tourist attractions
112438 when we initiated the brunei open back in 2005 we believed that it would become a major event on the asian tour and we are delighted that this dream has become a reality
112439 through the support from the corporate sector the stature of the brunei open has grown immensely and the event has received tremendous media coverage across asia and internationally last year we welcomed the first professional player from brunei who competed in the event and it remains our ambition to produce a local winner of the brunei open
112440 although it is still very much in its infancy the brunei open has become a truly international golf tournament on the asian tour we fully support the initiative to stage the brunei open as it will stimulate the growth of the game in brunei this is the first time that our group has been involved with professional golf in asia and we believe that it fits perfectly with our brand objectives
112441 the popularity of the game of golf has increased over the years and its very much due to the brunei open over the past three years we have enjoyed the privilege of witnessing world class golf and it has created a big impact amongst our golfers especially the juniors
112442 on behalf of our talented players i would like to extend our appreciation to brunei shell petroleum brunei tourism profitable group and brunei darussalam golf association who have played major roles in the success of the brunei open
112443 the asian tour will stage a record 29 tournaments with over us 38 million in total prize money this year and it is only through the continued success of top events like the brunei open that we are able to sustain our growth and create playing opportunities for asias talented players
112444 our championship course has witnessed many great battles in the brunei open and im sure spectators and television viewers will be treated to another world class golf tournament
112445 we are excited to host the brunei open once again and believe that this championship will continue to create a buzz for young bruneians to learn and master the game of golf and also increase sports tourism through the popular game of golf
112446 actes mission and philosophy which has been very successful for us globally is to work closely with local market experts in all our regions
112447 with the addition of dario to the european team who has had many years working in this industry acte is now poised to meet the needs and expectations of italys dynamic business travel community
112448 over the last few years acte has established a network community of professionals in italy
112449 i look forward to helping grow that community build press relations drive business development and continue to work with the acte italy council to provide quality education and networking events for the corporate travel industry in this country
112450 i am thrilled to appoint james mark to the new position of olympic project director for excel james has been with excel since the very early days and thoroughly deserves this accolade he will still head up excels event management team but will now be the sole conduit for the 2012 london olympic games reporting directly to the executive management board of excel london
112451 i am delighted to be in charge of managing the delivery of the 2012 olympic events to excel and working with the oda and locog to ensure that we as a business are structured to deal with it and deliver the greatest olympic games ever held with a strong lasting legacy for london
112452 whilst transaction activity has shown a marked decline from the historical highs achieved over the last two years we are still cautiously optimistic about the future of hotel investments over the medium term
112453 at 13 9 billion hotel investment volumes are now at a level comparable to that of 2004 which similarly recorded 14 0 billion worth of transactions within the first half of the year
112454 more importantly transaction volumes are still significantly higher than those achieved in 2002 2003 which remains the lowest point for the industry in this decade
112455 following the events of september 11 2001 the iraq war and the sars outbreak in 2003 transaction volumes sunk to a low of 3 6 billion in the first half of 2002 and remained weak through the end of 2003 based on year to date numbers the hotel investment market in 2008 appears to be in a much stronger position relative to the 2002 2003 period
112456 on the other hand with the weaker trading outlook anticipated for most markets sellers are expected to start adjusting to new pricing levels
112457 hoeft niet ze zijn heeeel hoog en voor mijn feestje
112458 to be used where it will make a real difference in someones life at your discretion
112459 with the company successfully restructured post uigea unlawful internet gambling enforcement act and returned to profitability and stability i feel the time is right for new challenges
112460 we are very fortunate to have in richard creed an experienced and effective executive with strong sector experience who can continue to grow the company and take it to its next stage of development
112461 do you have any ideas for a fundraiser for habitat for humanity this year

112464 ive written 205 of these things and i still have lots to say
112465 jangan salah tengkulak itu pedagang menengah itu sama dengan grosir hanya kedengarannya jelek dan tidak semua tengkulak itu jelek
112466 tengkulak itu realita yang hidup kita berikan rivalitas dengan servis yang lebih baik ditandingkan dengan kredit usaha rakyat kur kur yang berikan persaingan
112467 dan itu resikonya tinggi sekali siapa yang jamin kalau gagal hanya kita perlu atur yang lebih baik
112468 selama ini tidak ada lembaga yang bisa menggantikan tengkulak yang tidak birokratis sehingga kita harus merangkulnya
112469 nanti dalam munas hnsi akan kita bicarakan mengenai kerjasama dengan asosiasi punggawa ini

112476 itu hanya bisa dilakukan kalau kementerian koperasi punya aparat birokrasi yang memadai untuk itu
112477 aparat kementerian tidak bisa dan juga badan layanan umum blu seperti lembaga pengelola dana bergulir lpdb juga susah yang punya kemampuan itu mungkin bank seperti bri
112478 kita harus hitung untung ruginya jangan jangan kalau kita kerjakan sendiri posnya lebih besar dari dana yang disalurkan berarti lembaga pengelola dana bergulir lpdb harus mempunyai cabang di 33 provinsi kantor di 500 kabupaten kota serta pelayanan di 6 000 kecamatan berapa itu biayanya jadi kita pikir pikir jangan jangan itu lebih mahal
112479 saya kira untuk sementara ya mudah mudahan tahun ini ada pemecahan

112482 wir alle machen fehler wer ohne s nde ist werfe den ersten stein
112483 er hat einen fehler gemacht aber eine volkspartei braucht starke charaktere auch auf den fl geln wahlen gewinnen wir nur gemeinsam clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
112484 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
112485 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
112486 wolfgang clement betreibt ein ablenkungsman ver wenn er sich auf die meinungsfreiheit beruft
112487 mit seinem namen und seiner reputation als ehemaliger spd vize und bundesminister hat clement eine woche vor einer landtagswahl dazu aufgerufen nicht die spd zu w hlen
112488 aufgabe des schiedsgerichts ist es nicht politische berzeugungen zu beurteilen sondern verhalten
112489 wir vertrauen auf die bundesschiedskommission die wird eine kluge entscheidung treffen
112490 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht
112491 sein rauswurf w re ein symbol daf r dass diejenigen die einen n chternen realistischen wirtschaftsfreundlichen kurs vertreten in der spd keine politische heimat mehr haben

112498 the first lady called on the ancestral spirits to defend preah vihear and chase away the enemy
112499 i didnt expect the last question to be the most difficult one
112500 if i were to choose an event to compete in i would choose table tennis
112501 but i want to tell you that as the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalised it seems my hope is unlikely to be realised
112502 our boys were outnumbered and in a disadvantageous position but i believe we also inflicted heavy casualties on their side due to bloodstains on the route of their withdrawal
112503 the decision took into account the chief researchers past dismissal from seoul national university for manipulating research papers in 2005 and ethical questions in procuring human eggs and his indictment for illegally trading in human eggs
112504 we expected our request to be accepted because the research plan we submitted has no flaw in terms of legal and administrative procedures
112505 high oil prices are taking their toll on western economies prices are now on a downward trend due to weaker us economic data
112506 this is a large project we are hoping to even have positive surprises
112507 the existing refineries and manufacturing facilities are not operating at anything like their nameplate capacity as a consequence their supply has dropped much more than people expected
112508 a government may decide that the country needs 50 of the products to be refined locally or it may decide to have all products imported
112509 for an example if government policy requires 70 of petroleum demand to be refined locally a shortfall will only occur if this is not achieved
112510 an oil refinery is usually budgeted on a 20 year to 30 year basis and the outlook for the industry in south africa is bleak if peak oil production scenarios are to be believed
112511 traditionally south africa has relied mainly on international oil companies for its refined product requirements
112512 further the global trend is that independent oil companies are cutting back on their investment in downstream refining and are sweating the existing assets this is owing to besides other reasons environmental considerations where further capacity requires major capital investment without economic returns and the south african scenario is no exception
112513 any alternative for liquid fuel supply will take about five years to develop on the production side and even longer if specialised distribution channels are required in parallel with existing ones
112514 there are plans to add refinery capacity and based on those plans one can say that by 2015 we will go back to a situation where there is enough local refined capacity however between now and 2015 any growth in demand in south africa will have to be met by imports
112515 it is more about a payment issue than a security of supply issue because if one imports crude oil one is actually spending between 15 bl and 20 bl less than if one imports the product and if one is importing large volumes the numbers become large very quickly
112516 if 400 000 bbl d comes on stream in 2015 the country will then go from a shortage to a surplus and someone will then export assuming the refineries continue to be able to supply into the south african system this will then suggest that they would have done what is requi red to meet the cleaner fuels 2 specifications
112517 south african refineries tend to be in the third and fourth quarter of operational efficiency and cost effectiveness when compared with other refineries in for example asia pacific there is therefore scope for improvement in local refinery operations
112518 because in the time it takes to help one client who keeps doing the same thing wrong every year i can help 1 000 professionals learn how to solve these problems for their clients
112519 i am in the enviable position of trying not to build a client base
112520 has always hated taxes they are confusing irritating and annoying
112521 we have the opportunity we have the talent and certainly now we have the corporate sponsorship at the moment there is absolutely no excuse for the athletes in our country and i am not talking specifically only about beijing
112522 among the 57 athletes i think our best chances in beijing are in shooting and archery but it is important that we perform well as underdogs
112523 if expectations are high for favourites it does not necessary happen in 10 seconds in 100 meter dash favourites fall along the wayside in all disciplines in olympics asian and commonwealth games
112524 our indian athletes faithfully adhere to the olympic spirit and believe participation is more important but the athletes in western countries and the us believe in winning medals by competing in it
112525 india was competing in many events where we may not have chance of winning medals in the beijing games
112526 we should be concentrating on games that we are good at
112527 we do not have to participate in everything that is not our ball game we have the abilities to win medals and we just need to harness it to win those medals we always want our men or women athlete to do well every time they go out
112528 if we remain as underdogs and never attain the status of favourites we will continue to give a long shot and remain underdogs
112529 olympics come once in four years and it is critical that we prepare for two olympics out for example if we are not ready for london 2012 now it is too late we should be talking about 2016
112530 there are some chances that we take and come through but we have to be always preparing for two olympics out like countries like china america western countries and others who are always in the medal bracket
112531 sania mirza needs to give her best whatever be the draw to make the third round and mahesh bhupathi and leander paes gets to play in couple of rounds and feel comfortable in making the quarterfinals then anything can happen
112532 but i think we have good chance in variety of sports if get a break
112533 all our athletes be it anju bobby george or leander or sania they would have put in lot of hours of preparation before going to beijing the pride is there in all our athletes to make sure that our tricolor is brought up and the national anthem is sung
112534 it is not critical in lot of sports but it is critical in certain sports it probably raises its heads more in quadrennial games because there is one event that they are looking to win
112535 but in tennis it is lot less feasible because every week they are playing and we have four grand slams in a year and so on
112536 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations
112537 is merely the application of the equations as applied to static or incoming dynamic data what disturbs me most however is that
112538 so you want a group of kind but clueless people who can only empathize with someones inability to print or connect to wifi

112543 climate change is expected to increase a broad range of risks to the health of canadians
112544 even if rapid reductions of greenhouse gases can be achieved in the near term there is virtual certainty that climate change will be experienced for decades to come because of inertia in the climate system
112545 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health
112546 in addition medications commonly used by seniors such as those used to treat chronic cardiovascular disease may exacerbate the effects of extreme heat
112547 the 1998 ice storm that affected eastern canada played a crucial role in building up momentum to increase the capacity to cope with extreme weather
112548 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
112549 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
112550 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
112551 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
112552 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
112553 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
112554 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
112555 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
112556 the madness of trying to maintain endless economic growth in a world with finite resources
112557 coal is basically the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel and with the rising oil prices having an effect on gas prices there is a clear financial incentive for businesses to switch back to coal for generating power
112558 its just an insanity that flies in the face of all we know about climate change
112559 the united kingdom is facing many challenges in terms of energy and we have a responsibility to our customers to keep prices as low as we can while trying to get the environmental balance right
112560 while were investing in renewable energy options we cant put all our eggs in one basket its too simple to just focus on carbon emissions
112561 we know what we are planning on doing is illegal so the injunction wont make a difference
112562 oil sands extraction produces three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil production whilst oil shale extraction produces up to eight times as much
112563 for our oil sands base business our target is to cut emissions by 50 below those estimated at project start up by 2010
112564 this is an industry leading target for oil sands business
112565 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
112566 some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america
112567 from the perspective of john q public whos wondering what can i do to reduce emissions saying certain activities count and others dont doesnt pass the laugh test
112568 and we need credibility with the public on this issue
112569 the environment kind of got more important as we went along
112570 its hard to be preachy when you eat a lot at subway and burgerville
112571 but i think its important to be aware of the consumer culture and not just go along with what its dictating i think oregon is really ripe for that
112572 if bush was serious about americas dangerous and growing foreign oil dependency he would forthwith direct epa to do its job and regulate greenhouse gases
112573 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel causing serious greenhouse gas pollution yet president bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another
112574 the lawsuit is certainly typical of the attorney general of california
112575 if they dont like how we make a decision on something they sue and hope the courts will mandate toward their position it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt work
112576 the bush administration is wasting precious time with continued foot dragging time that we dont have

112589 i fully accept that beijing will be judged as a stand alone games

112695 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
112696 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
112697 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
112698 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
112699 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
112700 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
112701 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
112702 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
112703 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
112704 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
112705 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
112706 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
112707 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
112708 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties

112734 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
112735 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
112736 if you start from almost zero its easy to triple
112737 two things have to happen people have to begin deploying vista in a broad way and have to believe that all of their applications are fully compatible with a 64 bit environment
112738 its nice to see 64 bit use tracking this way

112787 the total number of people in the blog world is probably only a few hundred thousand and as much as they might hate to hear it for most movies thats not going to make the difference between a success and a failure

112797 i dont want to push jaque to run too hard as this is only his first training session with us after a long injury we must bring him on in the right manner
112798 schalk had some intensive treatment and is a bit stiff so he is sitting out as a precaution jaque and fourie du preez are looking very good and one can see that they are professional players
112799 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
112800 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
112801 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
112802 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
112803 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
112804 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent

112811 were all a unit we all take the blame as players and coaches and its up to all of us to fix it
112812 we all understand we didnt play our best rugby on saturday we had a lot of ball and we played at the wrong end of the park
112813 a lot of the game reflected the tactics we took into the game we didnt change them and that comes down to the players
112814 sometimes you enter a game with a mindset and its hard to change when youre out there
112815 we dont give a hell of a lot of messages
112816 i think our job is to become as redundant as possible during game time were trying to teach them to take responsibility and run the game
112817 under pressure sometimes that theory goes west and we give a few instructions but generally they run it
112818 i definitely believe there are still a lot of opportunities for us theres a lot of talent in this team if we can get the ball retention right and execution i think well be a different team altogether

112831 it is a sneaky way to pass on a price increase
112832 both upgraded products have proven to be preferred by consumers because they allow consumers to do more with less
112833 certain things come in standard quantities and it would seem strange to have anything else
112834 the market gurus stock investing strategies you can use from wall streets best
112835 though no one can go back and make a brand new start anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending
112836 human beings who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so
112837 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
112838 this ormer locklear was a very popular man a very daring man and he took all the stars up every time he came to the studio i succeeded very tactfully in avoiding him not because i was scared but because i wasnt particularly interested i was having too much fun on earth he
112839 whoever took me home i dont know all this is very vague to me know because it was such a shock but i do remember that my hair started falling out i could pull it out in clumps the shock was so great i guess i was just kind of crazy i couldnt believe what had happened when youre young those things are very shocking i dont even like to talk about it
112840 their health coverage is terminated and with little or no family support many of them end up homeless unemployed or in jail
112841 they have the same hopes and dreams as all other children in america but they have a harder path to realizing their dreams
112842 it encourages employers to look twice at these remarkable young people
112843 we want to prepare them for their transition into adulthood
112844 we need to protect our young children against sexual predators
112845 ive been doing this for a long time i need to get a little distance and see what i want to do with my life now that ive graduated
112846 its hard work to be a public defender and to do it day after day takes a lot of dedication and the people that i have worked with over there do have a lot of dedication
112847 they have all been excellent excellent people i have met a lot of people that i admire and respect
112848 the facts of this case to me are quite clear he knew what he was doing he intended to kill a human being and he knew that it was wrong
112849 i believe that benjamin was truly insane at the commission of the offense
112850 we wanted something more from the defense and the witnesses and we didnt get a lot
112851 he has no feelings or emotion about what he did
112852 before id say i was spending about 250 a month on gas now im down to probably 100
112853 theres a little bit of an inconvenience but its not too bad this definitely makes more sense
112854 the gas kept going up so i guess id rather buy one of these
112855 i figure over the course of six months its probably going to pay for itself in gas
112856 we kind of rely on our warehouse to keep us supplied
112857 when fuel prices go up the cost of running our buses goes up
112858 were spending over a quarter of a million dollars this year
112859 its just one of those things that you have to kind of bounce with
112860 reduced my summer trips going on a road trip to arizona to see the grand canyon to going camping at sonora ive driven much less than ever before planned trips to the store at times i will bike to the store and back
112861 for sure i have not been out as much as i had in recent years in comparison
112862 we get three or four people together and share a room it cuts the cost a bit
112863 its the big shows that people are going to where they can get points and not spending so much on gas
112864 we might be able to cut fuel costs in half just by using another vehicle
112865 we will use hybrid vehicles where we see that it is applicable
112866 the services will still be here but in a different structure
112867 we have been downsizing for a while this used to be a six person office

112873 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
112874 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
112875 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
112876 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
112877 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
112878 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
112879 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
112880 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas

112884 harare has plenty of underutilised land and we are saying we have wastewater in abundance why not bring the two together in a productive relationship
112885 the benefits of using wastewater have been investigated in various parts of the world particularly in asia west africa and latin america and these have demonstrated the potential of wastewater in the improvement of livelihoods and creation of employment opportunities
112886 urban agricultures strength lies in its proximity to markets an aspect which lowers food costs
112887 we are emphasising on the need to successfully use wastewater for crop production which is largely dependent on adopting appropriate strategies to optimise crop yields and quality while maintaining soil productivity and safeguarding the environment
112888 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
112889 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
112890 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
112891 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
112892 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it

112894 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
112895 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
112896 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
112897 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
112898 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
112899 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
112900 the new federal government has an opportunity to end this crisis and ensure the highest quality of care for all australians in residential aged care
112901 those nurses still working in aged care are paid on average 250 per week less then their colleagues in other areas
112902 licensing of nurses doctors and other health professionals is undertaken for a very good reason to protect the public
112903 there are 280 000 nurses in australia making up well over 50 of the health care workforce nurses know health care and they understand aged care it would be a tragedy if the people most suited to delivering high quality care to australias vulnerable aging population were unable to work in the industry because the federal government will not address the issues
112904 but one visit to the local health center for a simple immunization can help save a babys life

112908 protect is the first large scale prospective randomized controlled trial focused primarily on the safety of drug eluting stents which remains an important concern among patients and physicians alike
112909 the concern over stent safety centers primarily on the persistent issue of stent thrombosis particularly after one year post implant this trial the largest of its kind and the only with a global scope is designed and powered to provide a thorough long term assessment of these stents safety among the diverse population of patients with coronary artery disease who constitute routine clinical practice
112910 this trial including at least 1 000 in the u s arm will help further clarify the critical balance between safety and efficacy of drug eluting stents in real world practice
112911 a small absolute increase in des thrombosis compared with bms after 1 year gt 0 14 year would result in bms being the preferred strategy for the overall pci percutaneous coronary intervention population and that larger clinical trials with longer follow up are needed to
112912 the endeavor stent has been so well received worldwide most recently in the united states because it offers such an excellent combination of long term safety durable efficacy and renowned deliverability
112913 given the consistency with which the endeavor stent has performed in clinical studies and in clinical practice we have every confidence that protect will affirm the exceptional clinical results that physicians have come to expect from a second generation des were also confident that this trial will deliver the incremental evidence that physicians need to make the best treatment decisions on behalf of their patients with coronary artery disease
112914 this is an intriguing contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
112915 this represents a novel and elegant mechanism by which neurons are able to adapt to alcohol
112916 moreover since adaptation or tolerance to the drug likely contributes to alcohol abuse our findings identify a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention
112917 this study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol exposure can cause rapid changes in microrna levels altering gene expression and perhaps behavior
112918 in future studies it will be interesting to determine if similar microrna based regulatory mechanisms influence alcohol problems in human populations
112919 american consumers are entitled to have safe and effective drugs
112920 the fda is committed to taking enforcement action against firms that circumvent the drug approval process
112921 consumers need to be confident that the drugs and medical products they use are safe and effective and the fda will take the necessary measures to ensure safety and effectiveness throughout the lifecycle of the product including keeping the product from reaching the marketplace
112922 the fda will take action against companies that continue to manufacture or market an unapproved product after the marketing or distribution cessation date
112923 when a company does not heed a cessation date relating to a specific product the fda will take enforcement action relating to the companys other unapproved drugs
112924 generic drugs undergo a rigorous scientific review to ensure that they will provide the patient with the same amount of high quality safe and effective drug as the name brand product
112925 this approval provides an additional treatment option for patients who suffer from epilepsy bipolar disorder and migraines
112926 ge healthcares unique contributions to the science of imaging in general have been translated to clinically important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with brain diseases
112927 ge healthcare is very proud to accept this award from the international brain mapping and intraoperative surgical planning society
112928 organizations such as ibmisps are critical in guiding users and regulators through future developments in healthcare including image guided therapy ge healthcare is committed to introducing breakthrough technologies ensure the most effective clinical outcomes in surgery but also enable an early health model of care in the future focused on earlier diagnosis pre symptomatic disease detection and disease prevention
112929 the cnsi is pleased to be able to serve as the host venue for this years ibmisps world congress and i congratulate ge healthcare for this recognition and honor
112930 understanding the structure and design of the hiv spike has been the subject of intensive effort for over a decade because of its potential importance in understanding mechanisms of viral entry into immune system cells and designing treatment and prevention approaches
112931 the sophisticated imaging techniques used in this hiv aids study have the potential to advance our understanding of not only hiv but many other diseases including cancer
112932 previous research showing how hiv interacts with immune system cells and antibodies has been important in vaccine design
112933 however understanding the complete structure of the viral spike may reveal other vulnerable targets this knowledge will be crucial to solving the puzzles associated with strategies at the heart of virus invasion
112934 the insights gained by understanding the binding of one of the most effective broadly neutralizing antibodies lays the foundation for designing more effective strategies for blocking hiv infection
112935 we are working actively to increase the resolution of our structural analyses and to understand the differences in binding between antibodies that neutralize which are very rare in hiv infected individuals and non neutralizing antibodies that are found in almost all aids patients knowing what these differences are will be critical to designing better strategies to neutralize hiv and to providing a new addition to the arsenal of strategies to combat hiv aids
112936 although this news of a potential cure for alzheimers is extremely encouraging it will be at least four years future trial success permitting before it is available on prescription
112937 our 2008 report meeting our needs the level and quality of dementia support services in scotland revealed serious deficiencies in the amount and quality of care services available for people with dementia and their carers it is essential that steps are taken now to relieve the pressure on services and plan for the future increase in the numbers of people with dementia
112938 we think that imbalances in gut microflora lead to a chronic low level inflammation in the intestines and the presence of these inflammatory biomarkers in the bloodstream the overall impact of these circulating biomarkers is unclear but its been suggested that they could negatively impact healthy tissues
112939 the bifantis results not only have great implications for the treatment of digestive conditions but offer researchers a potentially new path of exploration around inflammation based diseases like arthritis
112940 strain and type of probiotic used may be responsible for the degree and type of improvement
112941 nurses and other health workers are already struggling to cope with almost daily increases in the cost of basic necessities such a food and energy the re opener clause was central to this years multi year pay talks because it provided a much needed safety net against just this situation
112942 we will be gathering evidence to present to the independent pay review body to show that there have been significant changes since the deal was negotiated in the spring our members reluctantly accepted 2 75 this year but the 2 54 and 2 5 increases negotiated for the next two years now fall well short of all expected inflation figures
112943 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
112944 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
112945 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
112946 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
112947 improper functioning of the subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
112948 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
112949 these figures are very worrying as they show that the drift of dentists away from the nhs is likely to accelerate in april 2009
112950 unlike the old system where funding followed the dentist and provision could be expanded at the moment dental funding is based on historical spending
112951 we do not expect all 26 per cent of dentists to quit the nhs but even a loss of 10 per cent of the dental workforce will cause a severe supply side shock the job of commissioning has been delegated to primary care trusts and health boards but responsibility lies fairly and squarely with the department of health which dictates the system in which dentists and pcts must work
112952 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
112953 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
112954 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
112955 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine
112956 birthweight gestational age and risks for small gestational age babies and preterm delivery did not differ among infants of women who had conceived both spontaneously and after assisted fertilisation the adverse outcomes of assisted fertilisation that we noted compared with those in the general population could therefore be attributable to the factors leading to infertility rather than to factors related to the reproductive technology
112957 considering that 14 of all newborns in europe are conceived after assisted reproductive technology art safety concerns are important reducing the number of multiple births has made improvements but we need to gain a better biological understanding of the reasons why infertility and ovarian stimulation may have adverse effects on infant health consequently we have to continuously monitor the short and long term risks of art
112958 in moderately active individuals short durations of stretching seem to temporarily improve flexibility without the detrimental strength losses that have been previously reported
112959 pre competition stretching became controversial due to what has been reported as decreases in performance however future research still needs to determine how these stretching durations may impact athletes
112960 durations of stretching at or less than eight minutes may not significantly alter lower leg strength
112961 our findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that for these muscles there may be a threshold of stretching between 8 and 10 minutes that would be necessary to decrease muscle strength
112962 a high increase like this might be a result of better reporting of errors which would be a good thing if we know more about whats going wrong we are in a better position to address the problem
112963 however nearly 30 000 errors relating to poor nutrition in hospitals is shocking nutrition is the bedrock of good care and recovery from illness older people are at particular risk of malnutrition and will struggle to respond to treatment or recover well if they are malnourished
112964 to achieve a world class health service it is absolutely essential that we get the basics like nutrition right
112965 the clubs owner kremikovtzi owner pramod mittal is leaving bulgaria and this will leave the club in a very difficult situation there is a very powerful attack against the club
112966 the criteria applied towards cska were very different from those applied towards other clubs
112967 in every club in bulgaria there are most probably irregularities but they took away the licence only of cska of the champion
112968 sugar kills think of the calories in sugar fat kills more people than anything else sugar is responsible for a madges bro on ghostwriting rumor
112969 we want to make sure they learn the routines and what we expect from them
112970 we want them hustling from station to station and that sort of thing we kind of try to take care of the mental part and then the real physical part starts when theyre in full pads after five days
112971 i think people are even more conscious of watching players in the heat than when i played
112972 we keep water bottles close by and players can get a break whenever they need it
112973 a new thing is we even keep iced towels in case theyre needed
112974 i want to see people flying around the football when were doing our drills and see some leadership developing
112975 well still run the wing t some but were looking at going from the i formation and one back in the shotgun too
112976 i also want to start working sooner than past years on the kicking game
112977 we werent very good on extra points last year and part of that was we had an undersized line weve been talking since last year about some new ways to block for better protection
112978 we lost a big senior class so we have a lot of young players who will have to learn fast
112979 a few years ago in the club championship a guy walked on to 15 with a three shot lead and left five down
112980 on 14 your second shot is generally going to be below your feet because of the slope and on 15 its a similar situation only with an uphill lie
112981 on 16 youve got to negotiate your tee shot because theres water you cant see from the tee that is easily reachable and another sloping green
112982 its just a difficult back nine here the ball can get away pretty easily
112983 the greens are fast and a few are rather tricky with some slope to them
112984 theres no question that when youre playing in a tournament like this youve got to have a good short game
112985 the higher handicap guys are usually high because they dont hit greens in regulation so your short game has got to be on
112986 its a nice course a good one but its tough
112987 there are 4 to 6 holes you can get in some real trouble on some others you can get in trouble and maybe get out of it
112988 the greens are very very fast extremely fast and hard to read
112989 the short game is where its all going to be chipping and putting unless you get in trouble and put up some big numbers
112990 youve got to hit it straight and stay out of trouble there are some holes that are real narrow and you can even be in the fairway if youre not in the right place you can be in a little trouble
112991 but on a lot of holes your drive is going to be very important not necessarily with your driver either but with 3 woods or long irons to keep the ball in the fairway and the greens are hard so you may have to play some bump and run shots
112992 some holes fit my game and some dont especially the doglegs
112993 i tried to remember some things and everyone i talked to who plays it says the greens are fast and they are theyre very fast if you get above the whole its time to hang on
112994 my problem is that i dont have that much control of my approach shots i have to take what i get guys who do have a real advantage
112995 were not a long course and you can spray the ball a little especially on the front
112996 but the better player has the advantage because he can generally control the distance on his irons and thats what you need
112997 the challenge for all players is our greens theyre tough to manage and theyve got some pretty good speed so id say to be successful here youve got to be solid with shots to the green and once youre there you have to manage your short game
112998 thats three tough holes in a row on the back
112999 thatll be a key if you can get through those three without any trouble youll be okay
113000 we cant allow foreign competitors to take products like we have here at wooster brush infringe on patent rights and then dump their products into the american market
113001 its just not fair we also need to make sure there are adequate work force and environmental regulations in place in other parts of the world particularly in the emerging economies in india and china and fundamentally not to allow foreign governments to subsidize foreign manufacturers to dump products into our economy that are artificially lower in cost to the manufacturer
113002 we transfer billions of dollars to foreign nations every year in exchange for oil
113003 for this to stop we must increase domestic production and invest in these long term if we dont make these crucial changes high gas and oil prices will continue to negatively impact businesses ability to grow and maintain their work force
113004 our relationship with ralph goes back to my predecessor stan welty jr
113005 he actually took some of our products to a trade committee in congress and made an example of woosters quality products and less than quality products from china regula has done a real nice job for wooster brush and if schuring is elected we would expect that would continue
113006 simplifying the tax code its complicated for many individuals but its far more complicated for businesses
113007 working in small business which we are i dont think the average taxpayer knows what the regulatory burden costs small businesses in terms of time manpower and literally dollars toward that outside help
113008 these communities companies and organizations have consistently demonstrated a strong capacity to implement grant funds to create thriving programs for ohio residents
113009 our award winners this year demonstrate best practices at the local level and we applaud their commitment to administer successful housing and community development programs
113010 not bad getting a return of 6 80 for every dollar invested
113011 we make it as painless for the businesses as we can
113012 we feel very fortunate to be able to provide grant opportunities to our downtown business owners to help them make significant improvements to their buildings through this community development block grant program
113013 a good testament to the teamwork that has enabled us to accomplish this
113014 we are going to remind ourselves to have fun when we get there
113015 weve worked hard to get here im still not sure weve soaked in winning the state championship weve practiced hard but well leave saturday morning and be ready to play but we want to have some fun too these are 14 year old kids we have to let them be boys at some point too
113016 we know they all went through the same format we did to get here
113017 were really looking forward to monday playing the host team that should be a fun atmosphere we expect the whole week to be fun and tough there are going to be a lot of state champions here
113018 were going to have to continue playing above average defense and get above average pitching
113019 were going to have to hit the ball better than we have been and were going to have to get a few bounces i really feel like we can go there and compete
113020 these kids have really worked hard since we put them together
113021 we started from scratch once we got them together and the kids really bought in weve really preached fundamentals and teamwork theyve really come together and responded to what weve wanted
113022 the prime minister lacks the public or political legitimacy to continue with the negotiations
113023 from the moment he announced he was stepping down he is only considered as the caretaker what legitimacy does he have to reach an agreement with the palestinians or with syria that the next government would be bound to
113024 this is a very serious problem this could lead to olmert making concessions towards the end of his term just so he will have an achievement to boast
113025 its sounds pathetic the prime ministers speech was stately conscientious and solemn i suggest he refrain from ruining that effect he doesnt have a majority in the knesset he doesnt even have a majority in his own party he cant lead any process
113026 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
113027 most of the township roads are chipped and sealed now in the townships where there are hotels
113028 we of course continue to hear retail sales are down we continue to hear the potential negative impact of the gas situation
113029 its a substantial amount of money and it was designed to generate direct income and direct advertising for people to stay overnight
113030 its a substantial thing for the county and something we didnt have 20 years ago
113031 usually the july heat gets to people i guess the people still want to get away they just dont want to go as far
113032 were within a pretty easy drive of a lot of the u s s population
113033 the time of the payments though can play a part in throwing the numbers off
113034 holmes county benefits from being a tourist destination and one of the pieces of that benefit are the bed taxes
113035 typically visitors that come in and spend the night are more likely to spend their money in other stores that may not be typically reflected in the bed taxes but its in the sales tax
113036 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
113037 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
113038 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
113039 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
113040 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
113041 my commitment was to withdraw even from literary life and all sorts of public life
113042 it is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach here
113043 i hope he gets a life sentence there is no death penalty at tribunal but for sure he deserves it
113044 highly recommended for looking at some very hot solo girls
113045 the producers of this site are famous for creating quality sexy goth and vampire content and we have been fans for a long time
113046 three pillows is a definite must see it is the biggest m m f bisexual site around but its coverage goes well beyond mixed sex threeways
113047 this site turned me on and got me off and i think that is the biggest praise i can give an erotic site there are a ton of pictures and each pic is available in two large formats 600 or 860 on longest sides exclusive stuff is always labeled there is just so much here including links to chat rooms personal ad access shockwave games affiliate store fun columns news items an interactive members story various boards and such that i just cant list it all customer service looks superb and cancellation info is super easy to find impressive hot and it is just getting started make no mistake there is a lot of original stuff here
113048 im fucking amazing and made it work ive been done with the costume for an hour now which is good because i had to catch up with my ms2005
113049 i got a motorcycle and i can even ride it hahaha awesome been learning how to fix maintain it started another band its amazing
113050 look at this awesome fan art i just received spoilers thanks to lovechristina how flattering gosh i really want to get new tattoos
113051 warning this video contains graphic scenes that are nsfw this is a video of two people fucking while hanging several hundred feet in the
113052 at this time the founder of this page will be taking a break apparently his life wasnt as fucked as he thought and he died of shock and humilations
113053 so ive been reading web comics for a while now

113055 he can shake off my arm but he cannot shake away climate change
113056 the stone age didnt end because we ran out of stones
113057 be the change you want to see in the world
113058 i got involved because i was getting in and out of trouble
113059 i thought this is one of the sports i could get involved with that would keep me out of trouble
113060 theres a lot of workout but i love it its helped me get back in shape helped with school and helped to me to learn how to control my anger
113061 they would take it to school and the teachers they dont really have time to work one on one with the kids
113062 but we do here we get to the root of the problem through different classes we offer
113063 ive been involved with boxing since i was able to walk
113064 if we dont make the project happen and if the community doesnt get behind it youre looking at a vacant piece of riverfront dirt for the foreseeable future
113065 i feel that strongly about that im willing to do what it takes
113066 my greatest concern is if somebody came in and speculated and purchased the property and just sat on it
113067 we have done a very poor job of utilizing our riverfront
113068 we want to make sure that everyone is on the same page from the get go
113069 hopefully they can but if they cant that means i will have to accept whatever they will give me or go out on my own
113070 i think that most of these folks are concerned about whats going to happen to me and how thats going to affect me
113071 and we wanted to make sure that they understood that regardless of what happens their housing needs are going to be taken care of now some of them might not qualify for the new construction but that doesnt mean theyre going to be put out on the streets
113072 if youve got limited median cuts those people living there cant sell their property for commercial uses because no one wants to build where you dont have access
113073 for one thing it takes away your bail out lane if you get into trouble
113074 also it hinders emergency vehicles because they dont have a free lane to run in if they get stuck behind a traffic jam
113075 by putting the median in youve eliminated two conflict points left turns into a driveway and left turns out of a driveway
113076 i would think most traffic engineers would conclude that medians provide safer overall conditions
113077 a word or phrase that results from mishearing or misinterpreting a song lyric
113078 what weve seen is a much slower lottery sales growth
113079 they may feel like thats their only chance of getting out of poverty
113080 i would like to get a financial gain but i play it for fun
113081 if i had done that as a private citizen i would have been cited for animal cruelty
113082 the stress of doing that on the staff is phenomenal and for them rescue groups to come up and get on them for euthanizing animals adds to the stress
113083 rescue groups get to pick and choose what they get
113084 it would be a lot easier on me my staff if we didnt have to euthanize unfortunately the numbers that we pick up are much higher than even what these rescue groups can do because there is only so many kennels in which to put these animals
113085 they have a different mission than we do as a rescue group
113086 our big thing is like all rescue groups you wish they could keep them indefinitely guess what they cant they have to take everything that comes through the door and when you have to do that you dont have the room
113087 there are people willing to assist but the door is closed
113088 we actually call or e mail other breed specific rescues for them to come get the animal
113089 so we do that also to try to get them out of here wed much rather them go out the front door adopted to a good home
113090 its game playing and animals are lost because of it
113091 its dirt cheap and the quality of video is awesome
113092 the university is committed to diversity as evidenced by the development of the onewvu program our coaches and staff also are committed to an atmosphere of community for our student athletes i look forward to speaking with pat more about his thoughts
113093 where if you are unhappy with the fees charged by your solicitor in litigation which may have ended up in the court of session you can apply to the
113094 auditors of the court based at scotlands three key courts glasgow aberdeen and of course the court of session in edinburgh the remaining auditors of court in the sheriff courts are employed directly by the scottish courts service
113095 the law society of scotland does not have the power to consider the amount of fees charged by a solicitor but has responsibility in relation to considering the quality of service provided by the solicitor
113096 legal firms like many other businesses in scotland are feeling the effects of the current economic climate
113097 the law society is monitoring the situation and while at present relatively few solicitors have informed us of being made redundant we have had reports of support staff from firms across the country having lost their jobs which is a real concern
113098 the professional practice department is giving help and advice to solicitors who may yet be faced with losing their job or equally to solicitor employers who have never before been in the position of having to make people redundant
113099 the legal profession is not only being affected by the economic situation but also by changes in legislation for example the slowdown has come at a time when summary justice reforms are having a negative impact on the volume of criminal legal aid work
113100 as the representative body for solicitors and working closely with paralegal colleagues we share the professions concerns and will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide support to our members

113128 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding middle eastern gaming policy i look to the studies and conclusions of tugman daras who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
113129 as of today no other device on the market can stand up to the nokia e71 as by and large every qwerty enabled device these days is unique in its own way so how do we assess the performance of such phones in my opinion the leading criteria should be the thumbboard quality and functionality

113161 its just a fun hobby for a retired guy like me
113162 but this year and last year weve got real unfavorable growing conditions
113163 i dont do no modern stuff like irrigation or planting them on plastic or stuff
113164 is youve got no control with the rain you never know what will turn up
113165 im not competitive this year but itll still be a lot of fun
113166 we never for a second doubted we could win this game
113167 the german word for tiger is tiger and the german word for iguana is leguan
113168 if you compete on it it could be career ending heidi was not risking her horse it was a very fine decision but it was devastating
113169 heidi wants to come back and be here when farley gets checked out
113170 after another scan it looks like a bit of rest and some tlc he will be back to fight another day
113171 all of us who know farley know he will be back better than ever
113172 without all your support my recent journey would not have been possible
113173 nobody wanted to say anything but she was performing extremely well her weakest suit was dressage and she was pushing numbers that were very very impressive it was a huge loss to the team its like losing the top sprinter on your relay team
113174 i understand from phillip dutton who was there that it was inspiring the way she handled it
113175 she handled it very classy shes a pretty strong person to handle that
113176 its a bad turn of events but shes not challenging why did it happen to me
113177 thats just the nature of the sport and those are the risks you take
113178 the horse is in good form and thats whats critical sure all of her fans and supporters are disappointed but they also know she did absolutely what was the right thing for the horse and were all proud of her
113179 we wanted first of all a quality person that would represent the lynx and the augusta community someone that we would be proud of and just had a lot of class
113180 second of all we wanted somebody that would put a physical team on the ice we wanted a coach that would control the players and jan wanted one that would get the kelly cup so were not asking for much
113181 ive been in this area quite a bit with charlotte and greenville ive been down here many times with our teams
113182 i know we broke your hearts a few times i hope we can mend them
113183 you hired a coach thats what i am thats what i do
113184 i have a passion for the game i love the game and i will give each and every one of you everything i have to put a winning team and a successful team on the ice
113185 its a two way street the amptp knows where to find us
113186 everyone is working under the assumption that nothing will happen until there is an election and the results are known
113187 i think sag thought lets drag this into july and august lets force the studios to make a mistake maybe theyll impose maybe theyll lock us out and that will galvanize the members and then well get a strike vote that didnt happen
113188 were hopeful that there will be a deal with actors but we have no choice but to proceed
113189 we cant be in a position where we dont have movies
113190 jetzt hab ich verjesse wat ich sache wollte eben hat isch dat noch jewusst
113191 not receiving the full cooperation of university of iowa employees and others
113192 we just wanted them to know they have our full support
113193 we look forward to meeting with the joint oversight committee to review the results of the investigation and any subsequent recommendations and we thank them once again for their support
113194 once natural areas become paved over they are lost forever
113195 i expect to see them down there but not as regularly
113196 i think really it was more than it was intended to be in the beginning
113197 it just took us too far away from really what we wanted to do
113198 i am ready to step down and spend more time with my family
113199 will be able to produce and do a lot more
113200 with u hauls you cant keep them for more than 24 hours
113201 for us it gives us 24 hours to clean and prepare it for the next person to move in

113203 luckily i could move all of my stuff into a house

113208 we think that the parents need to know exactly what they need to start looking for
113209 its not just the internet anymore youve got cell phones with cameras on them youve got text messaging games
113210 we didnt grow up with technology kids today born with it and these kids are smart
113211 you can either turn a blind eye to it or you can learn about it
113212 i was actually shocked that it was 100 or 150 calories more
113213 nutritionally all the research shows that the only meals that children eat away from home that are nutritious are school lunches
113214 the important thing is the outstanding grant funding we were able to get
113215 what were doing now is looking for smaller donations from businesses
113216 they are just beside themselves theyre just excited to look at it even though theyre not quite sure what it is
113217 were going to feel our way through this year and hopefully well be able to get all the kinks out so next year well be able to run with it when they walk in
113218 not too much will change in the way they are used but teachers will have access to this technology at the beginning of the year instead
113219 i want to try to figure out what i need to do there might be some kind of miracle a glimmer of hope what if i go out there to throw and dont feel anything for whatever reason if thats the case i wouldnt have the surgery
113220 were trying to raise the rigor and make our kids more competitive on the national and global level
113221 were looking at what schools do really well its not so much the individual teachers but the process
113222 were trying to get more students involved in a challenging area of study
113223 its not a program but how we think and work
113224 they got off work early or did whatever it took
113225 we would not have been able to provide any of these electronic boards at all
113226 we are so strapped for other things that money slips away for technology
113227 standardized tests are a reality at all levels of education
113228 the more prepared students are for standardized tests the less anxious they will be and the better they will perform
113229 the best i can say is that until we have 100 percent of our schools making enough progress in meeting the state goals and local goals we will continue to have work ahead we have increased our community accessibility as an organization managed our spending within the approved budget and improved in school safety in some areas and continue to improve in others

113293 just because i love it and miss it so much
113294 its hard to really put it into three things i think i just miss baltimore as a whole
113295 being away from a place youve been for almost 20 years all the sudden i pick up and move its just completely different from baltimore its so much smaller theres not as much to do baltimore has everything anything and everything whenever you want wherever you want

113299 that was the first hint i had that he might someday return

113303 a good nuxia actress has be be both graceful and
113304 we have the opportunity we have the talent and certainly now we have the corporate sponsorship at the moment there is absolutely no excuse for the athletes in our country and i am not talking specifically only about beijing
113305 among the 57 athletes i think our best chances in beijing are in shooting and archery but it is important that we perform well as underdogs
113306 if expectations are high for favourites it does not necessary happen in 10 seconds in 100 meter dash favourites fall along the wayside in all disciplines in olympics asian and commonwealth games
113307 our indian athletes faithfully adhere to the olympic spirit and believe participation is more important but the athletes in western countries and the us believe in winning medals by competing in it
113308 india was competing in many events where we may not have chance of winning medals in the beijing games
113309 we should be concentrating on games that we are good at
113310 we do not have to participate in everything that is not our ball game we have the abilities to win medals and we just need to harness it to win those medals we always want our men or women athlete to do well every time they go out
113311 if we remain as underdogs and never attain the status of favourites we will continue to give a long shot and remain underdogs
113312 olympics come once in four years and it is critical that we prepare for two olympics out for example if we are not ready for london 2012 now it is too late we should be talking about 2016
113313 there are some chances that we take and come through but we have to be always preparing for two olympics out like countries like china america western countries and others who are always in the medal bracket
113314 sania mirza needs to give her best whatever be the draw to make the third round and mahesh bhupathi and leander paes gets to play in couple of rounds and feel comfortable in making the quarterfinals then anything can happen
113315 but i think we have good chance in variety of sports if get a break
113316 all our athletes be it anju bobby george or leander or sania they would have put in lot of hours of preparation before going to beijing the pride is there in all our athletes to make sure that our tricolor is brought up and the national anthem is sung
113317 it is not critical in lot of sports but it is critical in certain sports it probably raises its heads more in quadrennial games because there is one event that they are looking to win
113318 but in tennis it is lot less feasible because every week they are playing and we have four grand slams in a year and so on
113319 at this time statistics dont mean that much to me maybe when im older ill sit down and look at them
113320 but i want to take a lot more wickets than that for the team and i want to perform better than i have before and i want to keep improving
113321 it means a lot to us getting back into the series and doing well for england and i think we showed that having not scored enough runs in the first place to get back into this position weve fought hard
113322 he bowled a fantastic spell and brought england back into the game
113323 we are on target in our core textile business the market response is also very encouraging our vapi phase 3 expansion is on schedule and should commence producing during q4 of this year the branded apparel business has continued its spectacular growth rates quarter on quarter

113326 sprint did not prove that its motivation and purpose was to estimate sprints damages
113327 the market is in the process of bottom formation and thats why the volatility is very high and every bit of negative news is being used to sell
113328 i dont see a clear trend emerging in the market before the next two to four weeks
113329 high oil prices are taking their toll on western economies prices are now on a downward trend due to weaker us economic data
113330 i feel very good and i think that the team is very strong i have a renewed desire and i am looking forward to the season
113331 it is normal that with each coach things are slightly different pep works a lot more on the physical aspects and also tactically i do not mean it is better or worse it is just the reality
113332 sometimes you do not need to speak to know what the coach wants i have known him for many years and we have the same philosophy and ideas about things which are that the team must keep possession and control the ball
113333 but we have spoken quite a bit in the past few days
113334 above all he has told me to look to score more often and that i should test the keeper a lot more he wants me to push up and help
113335 it is clear that this season my play will be more offensive because the central defenders are playing almost in midfield when we have the ball
113336 i truly believe in this project there is a philosophy of very serious hard work being planned it seems that nothing has been left to chance i think we are on the right path and now we just need to raise spirits even more with a few good wins
113337 i didnt understand monogamy i couldnt figure out how that could last and then i met bryn and i started to understand the beauty of constancy and history and change and going on the rollercoaster with someone of having a partner in life
113338 it was a shame to bogey the last i hit the seven iron very heavy but im still alive its all good
113339 i would have liked to have been one under par but its fine its a big golf tournament its a tough field so just play steady take some opportunities and get yourself into the position its thursday
113340 its silent hill resident evil and ring all rolled into one
113341 fans of survival horror will ultimately be pleased with this latest entry into the series
113342 but in this game all it takes is one or two plays to decide a game
113343 we feel very good about how we did against a team like that
113344 we will be playing mostly a teams in the tournament so that was a good start
113345 we havent been hitting the ball well as of late
113346 i think in the first game the girls were really nervous
113347 but in the second game as it wore on the girls settled in and got over it
113348 i didnt expect the last question to be the most difficult one
113349 if i were to choose an event to compete in i would choose table tennis
113350 but i want to tell you that as the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized it seems my hope is unlikely to be realized

113518 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
113519 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
113520 i will not retract the spirit of my comments that greg van zant may be a racist and is a bad coach and i have told the university i will not retract or apologize for them
113521 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
113522 i have been told by the university that they must show some support for van zant so as to not appear weak and run roughshod over by a student athlete so i must make it clear that i have decided not to play baseball not because i think the coach is a racist and a bad coach but because i wanted to concentrate on football however you should note that van zant is mentioned nowhere in this statement by name and the university has not released a separate statement backing up their coach who if he is smart is already starting to circulate his resume because his days here are clearly numbered because this message has been implied to me by the university and because i believe van zant should not be coaching at wvu i will allow this statement to be attached to my name as it works toward his ouster i generally have had good experiences here at wvu enough so that i have encouraged my younger brother to attend school here so i will allow my name to be attached to the phrase football family again in the spirit of comedy
113523 i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions
113524 i want everyone reading this statement to realize that this is the screaming flashing red sentence contained herein and the ultimate expression of my power and evaluation of the situation i am not apologizing for what i said
113525 i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
113526 i will not answer any more questions on this topic i would however encourage the university to investigate van zants record and for reporters to speak to former players

113529 the monetary policy measures just unveiled appear set to address a number of challenges that people have been facing especially as they relate to the new currency and cash limits

113568 two clashing myths have opened a gulf of misunderstanding towards russia
113569 in southern and central russia the princes eventually established their undisputed rule over the russian cities and principalities and their ancient peoples assembly the veche which had played an important role in many russian cities before the twelfth century gradually declined in importance
113570 the political subordination of novgorod to moscow intensified muscovite fanaticism while crushing out three distinctive traditions which novgorod and pskov had shared with advanced cities of high medieval west commercial cosmopolitanism representative government and philosophic rationalism
113571 russia is an enigma rapped in a riddle surrounded in a mystery
113572 novgorod in the days of its power is in name an elective principality in fact something like a democratic republic
113573 the power of these electoral princes rested mainly on their own personality and their capacity of maintaining popular support in modern language novgorod is largely governed by a party system
113574 the final silencing of the assembly bell in novgorod in 1478 ended the tradition of relative freedom from imperial authority and partial popular rule which until then novgorod had shared with many commercial cities of the west
113575 government business relations in the late tsarist period however could serve as a positive model for todays russia as high officials were prohibited from holding business positions
113576 unlike western parliaments the zemsky sobor sometimes referred to in english as
113577 meanwhile this defender of total autocracy had become the first ruler in russian history to summon a representative national assembly the zemsky sobor of 1566
113578 the first assembly to qualify as a genuine political institution was the assembly of 1598 which elected boris godunov to the throne of russia
113579 then in 1598 when the line of succession came to an end in russia also they turned to the polish procedure of electing a ruler the ill fated boris godunov in a specially convened zemsky sobor the first since 1566
113580 having served its function in establishing the monarchy however the popular council did not disband but continued to serve as the deliberate body of government
113581 in response to peters efforts to force a more rapid pace of westernization civic associations spontaneously formed in the larger urban centers and among the northern peasantry former novgorod lands to defend their traditional customs way of life and self government against state intrusion

113585 le persone che cercano di far diventare peggiore questo mondo non si concedono un giorno libero perch dovrei farlo io
113586 a volte bisogna rischiare delle incertezze per avere delle certezze

113589 aangezien de meeste gebruikers nooit hun draadloze router aanraken als die is ingesteld en vaak niet eens het standaard wachtwoord wijzigen is het gebruik van een draadloze router voor aanvallen zeer aantrekkelijk
113590 dit is in de meeste gevallen een dreiging voor thuisgebruikers maar ook bedrijven moeten ervoor zorgen dat hun infrastructuur beveiligd is beveiligingslekken in netwerkprinters zijn niet bijzonder en wanneer was de laatste keer dat je je printer op malware scande
113591 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing combined

113599 the proceeds will make a material dent in the groups net debt of around 1 5 billion pounds and again highlights a strong value case for the shares
113600 het is de eerst keer dat marswater is aangeraakt en geproefd
113601 det ser derfor ud til at danskernes faktiske forbrugsvalg f lger godt i tr d med udviklingen i stemningen blandt forbrugerne hvor forbrugertilliden er faldet til det laveste niveau siden 1992
113602 set i forhold til samme m ned sidste r var der tale om et fald i detailsalget p hele 6 3 pct baseret p de tilg ngelige statistikker er der meget der tyder p at der er tale om det st rste rlige fald i detailsalget siden 1977 dagens tal understreger at den danske konomi er inde i et betydeligt uvejr og at forbrugerne for alvor har klappet pengepungen i som konsekvens af de stigende energipriser det sv kkede boligmarked den stigende rentebyrde og den generelle konomiske usikkerhed
113603 det er bem rkelsesv rdigt men ikke overraskende at det is r er handlen med bekl dning og andre forbrugsvarer der tr kker ned i den samlede detailhandel de meget h jere prisstigninger p energi og f devarer betyder at en almindelig dansk famlile p rsbasis kan se frem til en merudgift p 12 500 kr det er en merudgift der er sv r at komme uden om og derfor straks g r indhug i budgettet det betyder at der der nu er f rre penge i budgettet til det mere luksusbetonede forbrug
113604 det er dog vigtigt at have for je at der er tale om en nedgang fra et ganske h jt niveau under opsvinget var det s ledes frem for alt forbruget af luksusvarer som bidrog til den meget h je forbrugsv kst
113605 n r det er sagt er der ingen tvivl om at detailsalget er p vej nedad og fortsat under pres forbrugernes k bekraft er under pres i jeblikket som f lge af udhulingen af k rekraften grundet stigende priser p energi og f devarer endvidere er formueeffekterne ogs aftagende idet s vel bolig som aktiemarkedet har v ret og fortsat er under massivt pres der er grund til at forvente at forbrugerne ogs fremadrettet vil v re tilbageholdende med deres indk b ikke mindst hvis arbejdsmarkedet som vi venter det vender inden l nge
113606 vi f lger naturligvis udviklingen omkring os meget n je men har indtil nu ikke kunnet genkende de negative signaler som ofte h res i denne tid men vi skal selvf lgelig ikke bare komme til at virke som jubelidioter i en tid hvor der er tegn p at konomien g r nedad
113607 derfor fastholder vi forventningerne til det resterende del af ret trods vi ligger ca 100 mio kr foran budgettet her ved halv ret
113608 so far hdmi has been able to stave off any threat from displayport but that situation soon will change
113609 in an effort to extend the income of our workers we are launching diskwento presyong pang empleyado project which is part of the non wage benefits to be provided our workers
113610 its devastating to see this young man with so much potential take his own life
113611 we would hope the police inquiry or possibly a coronial inquiry gets to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding this tragic suicide
113612 reports that bullying may have contributed to alexs suicide are particularly distressing
113613 no child should have to put up with the torment of being bullied bullying is a miserable practice that has no place in our states schools
113614 the first thing that premier morris iemma should do is to appoint a new full time education minister following john della boscas standing aside
113615 electric teen star may oust bronco injured bronco and hervey bay product nick emmett says hed consider leaving the club as he flood damage exceeds 20 million roads in the whitsundays are still being repaired after the floods in january and february this
113616 i was coming down from bangalow on the new years eve weekend down the hill and i remember checking my speed and i went around the corner and must have gathered a bit of speed
113617 it seems that camera is located inappropriately just to raise revenue i dont want to lose six points
113618 i dont believe i was going that fast but i cant get the information to disprove it therefore i have to plead guilty
113619 it appears there was a lack of concentration on a downhill run and it is very easy for a modern vehicle to pick up speed on a hill
113620 you never know how it will go until the day but the solicitor was fairly confident because the judge was aware of the situation
113621 electric teen star may oust bronco injured bronco and hervey bay product nick emmett says hed consider leaving the club as he flood damage exceeds 20 million roads in the whitsundays are still being repaired after the floods in january and february this
113622 remember how you supported this area how you valued it what changed councillors
113623 the reason my parents came to live in this beautiful spot is because of its peace and beautiful nature if you think you can put 25 000 people in the nature reserve and it not affect the animals think again
113624 this is the first time so called greenies and so called rednecks have been united in something like this
113625 we are genuinely surprised and saddened by the small but very vocal public response to our proposal
113626 we understand the byron region is a passionate place and respect everyones opinion but naively we didnt imagine such controversy or the amount of malicious misinformation circulating
113627 we understand that those closest to this proposal are afraid for their amenity but we are confident through experience we can address and respond to these concerns successfully and allay any apprehension
113628 as long as theyre doing it properly they should be doing it properly
113629 there must be some other way that they can gain access to this site to see more cultural and heritage sites destroyed for the benefit of economic outcomes im appalled and ashamed
113630 we have 100 clubs all over nsw and we feel that because weve successfully operated for 20 years that our boxers should at least be given the opportunity to try out for the commonwealth and olympics games teams
113631 those teams are funded by taxpayers money it should be the best boxers from australia and not just from his tunstalls association
113632 in some estimates we have half of australias boxers between us and global boxing another breakaway organisation and none of them will ever be considered for selection
113633 we have our own national champions in the league and we claim that some of them should be at least entitled to go in the trials
113634 were not even considering it in these olympics that was all fixed up months ago were focusing now on the commonwealth games in two years
113635 the australian olympic committee the commonwealth games association and the australian institute of sport recognise only one authority in each amateur sport
113636 swimming is the same athletics is the same they dont have off shoots wanting to compete
113637 despite what the league people believe we are not denying them the right we are not saying it thats their rules
113638 you either belong to a recognised body or you dont belong
113639 if a kid wants to be recognised and represent australia he knows what he can do
113640 just make an application to join and we accept them you cant be any fairer than that
113641 weve had people come to us from the league they find out in most cases the boxing is tougher then they expected and go back to the league
113642 we dont mind having to join up with them at the start of the trials but what mr tunstalls trying to do is make boys join up years in advance so they can exploit them in their boxing promotions and as a fundraiser for themselves
113643 electric teen star may oust bronco injured bronco and hervey bay product nick emmett says hed consider leaving the club as he flood damage exceeds 20 million roads in the whitsundays are still being repaired after the floods in january and february this
113644 three year olds ride him teenagers and adults he is so gentle
113645 he is a very people oriented horse and he has won all our hearts
113646 we have 14 horses here at the centre and 50 registered riders
113647 one of our young riders has ridden many of the horses but since riding roy she has made him her horse of choice
113648 he had problems with his feet but our farrier looked after him well and now he is one of the riders favourites
113649 everyone is welcome to meet roy and all the other horses at our open day on sunday
113650 theres been fairly bad news on retail sales and on a number of things so were going to reconsider and take another vote
113651 are rates restrictive they are mildly restrictive yes but given the prospects for inflation a mildly restrictive rate is justifiable
113652 it would seriously undermine the credibility of anti inflation policy in the uk if at the first time we face tough conditions there is discussion of changing the objective
113653 in our view the latter effect slowing growth will begin to dominate eventually giving the mpc enough comfort to begin cutting rates
113654 as the cost of mortgages begins to come down activity could be bolstered and restore some liquidity to the housing market
113655 whereas it used to be very much the retiring couple who were looking for somewhere nice to retire now with the property situation being what it is in this country a lot of first time buyers and younger couples are moving to france purely because its cheaper and the quality of life is better

113660 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
113661 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
113662 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
113663 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
113664 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
113665 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
113666 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
113667 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
113668 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
113669 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
113670 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
113671 without a doubt the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow insurgent and criminal attacks have prevented us from reaching some the countrys most vulnerable communities
113672 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
113673 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
113674 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
113675 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso
113676 the flip side of that is he cannot turn down the offer to take the position
113677 reforms that put a stress on consumers and ordinary people as well as the importance of revitalising the economy
113678 the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
113679 turnover in retail trade in germany in june 2008 was in nominal terms 1 2 percent and in real terms 3 9 percent smaller than that in the corresponding month of the previous year
113680 german consumers are now increasingly sending out the sos signal
113681 this does not mean that john q public will go on a shopping spree in the months to come
113682 the german consumer simply cannot be a match for declining export and investment activity in no way
113683 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
113684 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
113685 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
113686 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
113687 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
113688 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
113689 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
113690 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
113691 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
113692 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
113693 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
113694 search contacts your calendar and the web on your iphone apple phone show
113695 why would someone pay 99 cents for this when fill in the blank is free
113696 of the hundreds of programs currently available that keep score of fencing matches this is by far the best i was saying just the other day to my friends muffy and biff we were at the yacht club that there was a dearth of quality fencing related applications available for the apple iphone thank goodness this one has arrived though i certainly hope it can rise above the clutter of the other applications in the fencing scorer category
113697 i do not say to you that i will ask the father on your behalf
113698 and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate
113699 no one will enter the kingdom of heaven at my request but if you fill yourself
113700 the hour is coming when you will be scattered and you will leave me alone
113701 i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace
113702 we have sent them two letters already on this matter after the fifa ruling and we hope they will co operate with us
113703 i think fifa will step in if they refuse him an opportunity to represent his country at a big stage like the olympics
113704 i flew him from england just to sort everything out but they still wont budge
113705 i quite understand the position of the club but this could be his only chance of playing at the olympics
113706 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
113707 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
113708 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
113709 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
113710 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
113711 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
113712 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
113713 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
113714 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
113715 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
113716 this is a seminal discovery the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
113717 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise
113718 it has been a privilege to collaborate with kevin eggan and his team and to contribute to this critical step forward we will continue to work hand in hand with harvard researchers and project a l s to exploit the potential of these cells for drug screening
113719 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
113720 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
113721 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
113722 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
113723 people were sceptical the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
113724 its extremely time consuming and expensive to validate genotype testing however we probably will be testing these areas in a couple of years
113725 the results strongly support the notion that schizophrenia may be partly caused by the effects of such structural changes in genes both across the whole genome and in specific chromosomes
113726 we anticipate a breakthrough in the near future in research into psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia bipolar disease and autism at the same i wish to stress that in such a complex disease as schizophrenia there is a need for research on both genetic and environmental causes and on treatment and management
113727 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
113728 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment
113729 the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
113730 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

113748 this is the second study that otx has conducted which clearly demonstrates that ads in context outperform those shown out of context although this may seem somewhat intuitive the research highlights the very significant point that consumers are simply better able to note the ad and the brand and actively remember the brand name of the product after being shown the ad in a relevant context
113749 we have used the exact same methodology for both a leading consumer electronics company and leading consumer skin care company advertisers who are shifting budgets online who demand performance and who care deeply about their brand must have contextually relevant ads at the core of their media strategy

113820 and have an allotted number of birds to collect typically between 500 and 1 000
113821 every single one of those hens will have a home waiting for her when we get back
113822 we check through them to make sure they are fit and healthy to go and then during the afternoon we have a steady stream of people taking them off to their nice new homes
113823 i think people feel compassion for them really theyve never seen the outside world theyve never felt the sun on their back nor the wind in their feathers
113824 weve built them a chicken shed in the garden which is nice and big
113825 most of the time theyre going to live free range in the garden and when were not around theyre going to go into the run
113826 a year ago on our sons sixth birthday he asked if he could have chickens and we said if he was still serious a year later he could have them a year later that was all he wanted
113827 so we gave him his birthday money and hes just donated it to the trust for his chickens
113828 we took him to a poultry store to see the pure breeds but he decided he wanted ex battery hens and decided to wait for these
113829 within two weeks we think they have a fair level of fitness again their feathers take a little while to come through but soon enough theyll all be back
113830 a farmer will pay about 3 45 for an egg laying chicken but after 12 13 months theyre considered spent and the smaller battery farmer will have problems getting rid of them to make way for his next lot of birds
113831 the dealers want to collect several thousand birds at a time if they cant theyll charge the farmers for taking the hens away which could be as much as 25 30 pence a bird
113832 it takes 6 7 000 to fill a wagon and if they have to make four to five pick ups to fill up it will take too long and be uneconomical
113833 if they work with the battery hen welfare trust it doesnt cost the farmer and the new owners will get a nice hen for their garden and thatll give them eggs for the next couple of years
113834 obviously we want as many birds free ranging as possible but we also acknowledge that there is a great threat from imported cheap caged eggs
113835 at this early stage we must retain an open mind regarding the circumstances and motive but it appears there was an incident in the street with a man who subsequently made off on foot

113839 there was something about star wars that has always stayed with me
113840 theres so much they can do with the story thats one of the things that makes it stay interesting
113841 they brought out a line of books that was pretty lame so i stopped buying those
113842 id always loved stars wars and after my wife passed away 15 years ago i threw myself into it and the community became my family i meet some of my best friends at these events i have a day job and a mortgage and car but this is my real life i couldnt say what id do if i didnt have star wars and the community
113843 people will tell you how much star wars means to them fan culture is all sorts of things it can be geeks in costumes who havent showered for two weeks or ordinary looking people who received their love of star wars from their parents and have in turn passed it on to their children
113844 the live action movies were really centred on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
113845 we grew up with star wars we really believe in it
113846 you have to handle fans as a fellow fan and you cant talk down to them fans are smart if they smell bullshit theyre not going to jump into it
113847 ive been called a geek an anorak and even a nutter in australia i dont care none of us cares you take the word people are calling you and you desensitise it if thats what we are then thats what we are and well keep on going

113931 all viruses rely on host cell proteins and their associated mechanisms to complete the viral life cycle identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy
113932 we found genes proteins that are important for influenza virus replication we identified about 100 genes
113933 we took three and tested them and they were important for flu virus replication in humans
113934 i presume that many of the other genes we identified are also important for influenza virus replication in humans
113935 if you could inhibit block the interaction between those host proteins and influenza virus proteins you can inhibit virus replication this can be a target for development of new drugs

113948 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
113949 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
113950 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack
113951 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
113952 what we do not know is if garlic works as well as pills over the long term or if it would reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke
113953 there is no harm in taking garlic along with other lifestyle factors such as eating less red meat less salt less alcohol and taking more exercise and also continuing to take blood pressure medication
113954 anyone could benefit from regular doses of garlic but it is important not to assume that taking supplements is all you need to treat high blood pressure

114009 a nuclear family whose trials and tribulations my husband and i repeatedly could relate to we enjoyed sharing many strips with our children since we felt the strips depicted values we hope to instill in them
114010 sensitive and humorous portrayal of the conflicts and victories that touch the lives of working women
114011 its one of our top strips in every age bracket its amazing our readers have a real personal attachment to sally

114016 demand for uranium from accelerating nuclear power generation is outpacing mine production creating a widening supply gap we look forward to implementing our aggressive exploration plans for the itigi manyoni uranium prospect in order to meet this rising demand
114017 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
114018 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
114019 he just takes his time and makes a decision and sticks by it
114020 its definitely better i feel much more comfortable up at the net im being a bit more aggressive on the second serve return than i was before and im definitely physically stronger as well
114021 so i feel more comfortable and feel that i can definitely compete at this level for five or six matches rather than two or three like i was able to do last year
114022 only a matter of time before someone crosses the line
114023 i am massively concerned because we are at the start of four years in which kids who are now 15 or over will want to be on the start line in london which will be the biggest thing to hit british sport in our lifetime
114024 the fact is that we have epo an increasing drug of choice for a number of disciplines we have growth hormone which it has been demonstrated you can get from a pub on the corner and we have testosterone available all over the internet
114025 i just think the photographer got a bad shot of her or it was touched up to make her look bad
114026 i saw madonna two days before at her rehearsal and she looked amazing glowing skin and working really hard on her show
114027 but she was dancing and singing better than ever and ate a nice healthy meal
114028 from a physician who has never evaluated or treated madonna its my impression that if she has lost significant weight that youre seeing a good amount of facial fat loss in her face
114029 the cheekbones can often stand out appearing as though someone has undergone some form of mid face enhancement
114030 maybe she was getting ready to hurl a spitball at somebody
114031 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
114032 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
114033 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
114034 it was very frustrating because i didnt know how it was going to pull up i was in pain through the whole match
114035 the pain wasnt so sharp but i couldnt hold my racquet on my forehand
114036 i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player she figured it out
114037 the first thing i was thinking was well girl you made it
114038 the second thing was that it was the first top 10 player ive beaten ive had a lot of chances before and played some great matches but never did that it was also the first night match i won in my career
114039 so there were a lot of first times today i dont know how but i managed it
114040 turnover in retail trade in germany in june 2008 was in nominal terms 1 2 percent and in real terms 3 9 percent smaller than that in the corresponding month of the previous year
114041 german consumers are now increasingly sending out the sos signal
114042 this does not mean that john q public will go on a shopping spree in the months to come
114043 the german consumer simply cannot be a match for declining export and investment activity in no way
114044 if possible i want to reduce the fuel price right now be patient the government will announce it later
114045 the government is studying several matters before making the announcement
114046 i think if the trend of oil prices continues downwards it is only right that it is reflected in domestic prices there is a desire for us to reflect the current market situation
114047 if oil prices remain between 120 dollars a barrel and 125 dollars a barrel for two weeks
114048 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
114049 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
114050 when you lose a couple it puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
114051 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations
114052 they are excited they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are ready to climb
114053 as to whether they are going to be good enough we cant do anymore than we are doing
114054 hes a world class player but we cant expect him to do everything
114055 we have to step up as a team and if we do that well be a more competitive side we have to play a lot smarter
114056 we have to be smart about the way we play but also bring the physical side of things and the aggression if we are to get what we are after
114057 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
114058 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
114059 when political arrests end in the west bank everything else will come to an end
114060 there may still be 10 15 students under the rubble
114061 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
114062 the first lady called on the ancestral spirits to defend preah vihear and chase away the enemy
114063 its natural that companies are grabbing the chance to take advantage when the patriotic sentiment is at its peak
114064 ludacris is a talented individual but he should be ashamed of these lyrics as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
114065 jesse talking slick and apologizing for what if you said it then you meant it how you want it have a gut

114071 there may still be 10 15 students under the rubble
114072 we work only to pay for the fuel we are not making money
114073 we ask for more but clients cannot give us more because they have no money
114074 we want the government to increase the fares so that we can feed ourselves
114075 we all agree with the strike because life has become too expensive
114076 everything is getting expensive in abidjan but our salaries do not rise
114077 we cant even eat well and now the cost of transport is increasing
114078 this is killing us because when transport prices rise everything becomes more expensive
114079 in terms of the impact on the price of transportation it means the price of goods imported and exported increases and many of the goods imported are primarily food related so thats an extra cost especially to the poor
114080 everything increases our profit decreases its exhausting but this is happening worldwide we cant do anything about it
114081 the government became aware that it had become impossible for sonabhy to continue working if the price freeze was maintained
114082 we have seen successful attempts at smuggling on the increase in guinea conakry i understand its 27 000 leones a gallon so fuel is smuggled out
114083 our boys were outnumbered and in a disadvantageous position but i believe we also inflicted heavy casualties on their side due to bloodstains on the route of their withdrawal
114084 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
114085 that way a student would have saved money and time by not travelling all the way from kunduz or takhar to kabul to buy a book
114086 there was a big rush and enthusiasm but i had to drop the project for i did not receive support from the government and the ngos of course business was and is part of my agenda but people would have benefitted more from it
114087 through books our kids would know about their culture history and understand the world books are like seas you have to dive into the sea to get the pearl you have to read books to know how to solve your countrys problems
114088 unless we reintroduce the habit of book reading we will have more illiterates and more trouble
114089 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
114090 there was a huge blast i took my wife and ran to the site the building was totally collapsed we rescued as many as we could and then we brought them with our vehicle to the hospital

114116 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
114117 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
114118 the scientific community is really going to run with this
114119 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

114133 we actually do a lot of our creating on stage
114134 as the drummer i hold the beat keep up with petes sudden improvisations sometimes its too loud to hear the music from the monitor i actually watch his hands move along the guitar that way i can tell if hes drifted into something new like a reggae version of the song
114135 i have been playing music and dj ing since i was 15 my approach to dj ing is to respond to the crowd maybe give them something they havent heard but also give them what they want
114136 file sharing that whole thing its getting people turned on to music

114155 tapi hidup kita tidak seluruhnya matematika dan angka angka ada dimensi non matematis dan di luar angka angka logis
114156 ya kalau kita hanya tertuju pada gaji kita akan menjadi orang pelit individualis bahkan bisa jadi tamak loba karena berapapun sebenarnya nilai gaji setiap orang dia tidak akan pernah merasa cukup lalu dia akan berkata bagaimana mau sedekah untuk kita saja kurang
114157 mana mungkin dengan gaji sebesar itu kita bisa hidup tenang bisa sedekah bisa berbagi
114158 ya karena kita masih menggunakan pola pikir matematis cobalah keluar dari medium itu oke sakarang jawab pertanyaan saya kita punya uang sepuluh ribu makan bakso enam ribu es campur tiga ribu yang seribu kita berikan pada pengemis berapa sisa uang kita
114159 tapi saya jawab masih ada kita masih memiliki sisa seribu rupiah dan seribu rupiah itu abadi bahkan memancing rezeki yang tidak terduga
114160 mas bagaimana bisa uang yang terakhir seribu rupiah itu kan sudah
114161 ya memang habis karena kita masih memakai logika matematis tapi cobalah tinggalkan pola pikir itu dan beralihlah pada logika sedekah uang yang seribu itu dinikmati pengemis jangan salah bisa jadi puluhan lontaran doa keberkahan untuk kita keluar dari mulut pengemis itu atas pemberian kita itu baru satu pengemis bagaimana jika kita memberikannya lebih itu dicatat malaikat dan didengar allah itu menjadi sedekah kita pada allah dan menjadi penolong di akhirat sesungguhnya yang seribu itulah milik kita yang abadi sementara nilai bakso dan es campur itu ujung ujungnya masuk wc
114162 terus gimana caranya mas agar bisa menyeimbangkan nilai metematis dengan dimensi sedekah itu
114163 pertama ingat sedekah tidak akan membuat orang jadi miskin tapi sebaliknya menjadikan ia kaya kedua jangan terikat dengan keterbatasan gaji tapi percayalah pada keluasan rizki ketiga lihatlah ke bawah jangan lihat ke atas dan yang terakhir padukanlah nilai qonaah ridha dan syukur

114187 in my distress i called to the lord and he answered me from the depths of the grave i called for help and you listened to my cry you hurled me into the deep into the very heart of the seas and the currents swirled about me all your waves and breakers swept over me i said i have been banished from your sight yet i will look again toward your holy temple the engulfing waters threatened me the deep surrounded me seaweed was wrapped around my head to the roots of the mountains i sank down the earth beneath barred me in forever but you brought my life up from the pit o lord my god when my life was ebbing away i remembered you lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord
114188 if you release me from this whale i will go to nineveh but even if you dont free me i will die worshiping you with all my heart

114191 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
114192 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
114193 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
114194 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
114195 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
114196 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
114197 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
114198 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
114199 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
114200 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
114201 you have value on the ground more than you spent
114202 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
114203 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
114204 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
114205 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
114206 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
114207 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
114208 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
114209 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
114210 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
114211 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
114212 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
114213 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
114214 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
114215 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
114216 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
114217 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
114218 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
114219 kennengelernt haben wir uns im rahmen der beratungs und betreuungst tigkeit von arbeitslosen menschen im laufe unserer intensiven zusammenarbeit haben wir erkannt dass wir uns unabh ngig voneinander seit jahren mit den themen liebeskummer und einsamkeit besch ftigen so entstand die idee zur gr ndung der gemeinsamen liebskummer praxis
114220 bei menschen die sich im liebeskummer schmerz befinden tritt das rationale denken und handeln oft in den hintergrund was sowohl f r die betroffenen als auch f r au enstehende schwer verst ndlich ist
114221 es ist ein intimer leidensprozess der nicht mit pauschalratschl gen gemildert werden kann
114222 in unserer liebeskummer praxis wollen wir betroffenen menschen einen weg aus ihren belastenden lebenssituationen zeigen wir wollen das thema liebeskummer enttabuisieren und den betroffenen die scham nehmen dar ber zu reden und wir wollen aufzeigen dass liebeskummer nicht nur teenager sondern menschen aller altersgruppen m nner und frauen hetero homo und transsexuelle menschen betrifft
114223 die sozialdemokratinnen sind w hrend der ganzen zeit w hrend der verhandlungen und der gespr che mit investor dietrich mateschitz immer hinter dem projekt spielberg gestanden und haben auch jetzt bei der sondersitzung alle wege f r einen raschen baubeginn geebnet

114414 for the success of responsible forestry in the congo basin there is a high need for government to set up enabling conditions that include enacting adequate legislation and enforcement and promoting good governance while providing support to responsible forestry initiatives

114426 we took in a pitbull mix a few weeks ago from a new jersey woman who was living in her car
114427 you dont have to worry about your pet being euthanized if youre losing your home because of foreclosure
114428 came like every six weeks before they come every 10 to 12 weeks now
114429 i hope people take away more than that this is just a really fat cat
114430 we are outrageously crowded and we dont want to have to euthanize more animals but we desperately need volunteers and donations to help save them
114431 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
114432 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
114433 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
114434 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
114435 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
114436 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
114437 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
114438 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
114439 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
114440 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
114441 you went to bed at night thinking i wonder if britney will be alive in the morning
114442 i was interested in looking at why people were drawn to celebrity tragedy and her story seemed a good way of doing that
114443 i quite like britney and i found the coverage of her breakdown quite compelling but also a bit creepy there were shades of diana in the sense that people seemed to be drawn to this tragedy in her life
114444 when i began i thought this is going to be a battle between the paparazzi who are making money out of her breakdown and the people who are trying to save her but i found that theyre actually not that different
114445 the film isnt about britney at all really its about the breakdown she was going through it could be amy winehouse or lindsay lohan there will always be someone
114446 in the end she dies in an accident that involves the paparazzi so britney could be my new princess diana i feel i know britney better than i know maybe the people that i really know
114447 his campaign to rescue britney is more about him getting more exposure for himself
114448 he admitted he wanted a tv or radio show out of it
114449 if people stopped buying those magazines and watching those shows people will not be sitting on britney spears its only because she makes everybody money
114450 and fair enough if you make a programme about britney more people are going to watch it but i would differentiate myself from that in the sense its not a programme about britney its about the ordinary people whose lives became intertwined in this womans breakdown
114451 that is the cost of fame and fortune if you dont want a camera following your every move go back to louisiana
114452 its a reflection of this administrations inability to deal in a rational way with complex issues such as immigration
114453 this gives illegal immigrants the chance to leave the country without any harm being done and under very controlled circumstances
114454 ice hopes to expand the program through a phased rollout approach
114455 illegal immigration will be solved when we stop squandering u s taxpayer dollars on silly programs
114456 this isnt the free new years eve taxi ride where no questions are asked
114457 im here because i want to do my best for my children not to get a ride back

114496 yesterday barack obama was in the fatherland john mccain was in grandfather land
114497 barack obama is in france today and again mccain doing everything to compete with him like today he ordered the french toast combo at ihop
114498 you know barack obama the last ten days was traveling overseas campaigning in europe and everywhere it was so successful campaigning abroad that he is actually thinking about campaigning here in the united states
114499 barack obamas upset did you hear about this hes angry cause the other day in israel someone revealed the contents of a private prayer that obama inserted into jerusalems western wall its supposed to be private and someone opened it up and revealed it yeah experts say its even worse than the time the washington post printed president bushs letter to santa
114500 did you hear about this the dalai lama had a near death experience today he met with john mccain
114501 you see where john mccain met with the dalai lama that was pretty amazing yeah the man millions believe goes back to the seventh century standing next to the dalai lama
114502 poor john mccain the media is so in love theyre all over barack obama and mccain cant get any media attention did you see what mccain did today he kept getting in and out of his limo today with no underwear on just to get the photographers
114503 it is tough seeing your old flame with someone new john mccain and the media had a very hot fling back in the summer of 2000 they even had cute little nicknames for each other the press called mccain maverick and mccain called the press any time he wanted favorable coverage
114504 yesterday federal immigration officials arrested 43 illegal immigrants from mexico in hawaii in hawaii how lost were they boy and today president bush called for building a fence around hawaii
114505 and in puerto rico it is constitution day it is constitution day in puerto rico so thats where the constitution went i knew we werent using it anymore
114506 they said on the news earlier tonight that this political campaign has only 100 days left only anybody complaining that this thing was dragging out oh not quick enough only 100 days left oh god 100 days i dont know whats less likely barack obama getting enough experience in 100 days or john mccain living another 100 days
114507 the thing that led to the move was our learning that ishmaally kitchen would be available to us this year
114508 i havent played with ishmaally yet but hes obviously a big and talented guy and im sure he is going to make us better
114509 all of a sudden we have all of this depth on the defensive line and we felt like prishod could make the move to offense and make us better on that side of the ball with how athletic and big he is
114510 pat has been at the position for a while and he is very knowledgeable about the position
114511 prishod brings more size and he could be a good fit for us down near the goal line when we are running the ball a lot we can go with him
114512 both guys are going to play in camp theyll be competing to determine who gets the bulk of the playing time the nice thing is that this gives us even more depth at another position
114513 this move is going to give prishod more of an opportunity to get on the field
114514 to his credit when we approached him about the idea he was all for it he wants to win football games and he understood that this could no 1 make this football team better and no 2 it could be a good opportunity for him
114515 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
114516 he passed the ball well played great defense ran the lanes he played like lebron james
114517 the best was lebron james who made a big difference
114518 i think the first quarter was an adjustment period for us we were getting used to what they were running what their sets were
114519 the second quarter we did a much better job of locking in and taking those away
114520 he got player of the game i voted for him twice
114521 even some of the guys on turkey were calling for goaltending but its legal
114522 we allowed them to get into a little comfort zone because were trying to blow them out too fast
114523 once we realized we just need to win the game and our pressure will automatically put pressure on the other team we did a great job in the second quarter of bumping the lead up
114524 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
114525 said dr caroline johnson member of the racgp national standing committee quality care and a melbourne based gp
114526 general practitioners are aware of a potential increase in suicidal thinking and behavior for adolescents on ssris and consequently the racgp and other medical colleges have developed advice for members on use
114527 good general practice involves assessing the needs of each individual the patient and gp need to consider a range of factors including severity of symptoms past history current medications and lifestyle when determining an appropriate treatment pathway
114528 as a first step gps and patients should discuss treatment options which may include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on changing negative thinking and behavior that can contribute to depression support groups medication or a combination of treatments
114529 studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy is often effective in depression
114530 however antidepressants such as ssris form a valuable part of care provided to some patients within the context of a comprehensive management plan and only where cognitive behavioral therapy has failed the depression is so severe that it interferes with the young persons capacity to engage in counseling or the depression is life threatening
114531 we believe it is important that children and adolescents continue to have access to these medications
114532 undiagnosed depression can be very serious medical research shows that the longer a depressed person goes untreated the longer their condition can last and the lower their chances for a full recovery
114533 it is very important to find the treatment or combination of treatments that will work best to increase an individuals chances of becoming well patients need access to care as early as possible after they identify that they have mental health concerns
114534 if anyone currently taking antidepressants has concerns about their medication based on media reports we encourage them to talk to their regular doctor before making any alterations to their treatment plan
114535 one of the e mails was in favor saying they felt that they needed to pay their fair share to kent
114536 the others were just to talk to me about the difficulties they were having economically
114537 but what i try to get across to people is no these are not economically good times but what you have to understand is these are not economically good times for the city either
114538 how much more can you tax people we need money theres no question about it i just dont know if weve exhausted all other methods of making the budget look a little more sound
114539 but i have to take the stance that its my responsibility to make the city solvent
114540 this is just one of many steps to make the city solvent
114541 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
114542 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
114543 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
114544 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
114545 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
114546 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game
114547 organizers of streetsboro family days started the festival on a somber note thursday paying tribute to two local fallen heroes along with all members of the armed forces past and present
114548 who made the ultimate sacrifice with a son who was defending our country
114549 god bless you and god bless him i know he is up there
114550 thank you to everyone and now i feel like we owe the city again
114551 i think its important that they are showing support for all our troops and not just my son it shows that streetsboro supports them and its how our nation should be supporting them
114552 mr newell has served this district well for 10 years

114567 its a confidential issue and i dont want to prejudice any potential negotiations
114568 these negotiations are long and protracted they involve existing shareholders and in some cases governments and regulators
114569 worried at the fact that china has moved away from its commitments
114570 as far as we can have an influence we demand that promises made are kept
114571 we are concerned that the beijing olympics might simply become a giant spectacle to distract the attention of the international public from the violations of human and civil rights in china and in other countries with the chinese governments significant influence
114572 the authorities have not only failed to honour their pledge but they have intensified their crackdown on journalists and others who seek to exercise their right to freedom of expression
114573 foreign journalists now reporting from china are regularly harassed and even expelled as was the case during the march 2008 events in tibet
114574 exert serious pressure on the chinese authorities to cease their flagrant and persistent abuses of human rights
114575 condemns the international olympic committees acceptance of the fact the chinese authorities are blocking access to certain websites at the olympic games media centre in beijing
114576 the organization also condemns the cynicism of the chinese authorities who have yet again lied and the iocs inability to prevent this situation because of its refusal to speak out for several years
114577 the fact that this is happening shouldnt be the least bit surprising
114578 chinas supposed commitment to human rights which was supposed to have won them the right to host the olympics has failed at even the most basic level in access for journalists
114579 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
114580 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
114581 i look forward to working harmoniously with the new board of yahoo

114595 we are not going to join the government by putting the madhes agenda on hold instead we can play an active role in writing the new constitution by remaining in the opposition
114596 the three party alliance must break up for the maoists to lead the next government
114597 the maoists shouldnt take the initiative in forming the government until there is a conducive atmosphere currently we dont have a majority to claim the right to form the government
114598 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
114599 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon

114601 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

114607 oil sands extraction produces three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil production whilst oil shale extraction produces up to eight times as much
114608 for our oil sands base business our target is to cut emissions by 50 below those estimated at project start up by 2010
114609 this is an industry leading target for oil sands business

114656 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
114657 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
114658 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
114659 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
114660 people were sceptical the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
114661 its extremely time consuming and expensive to validate genotype testing however we probably will be testing these areas in a couple of years
114662 the results strongly support the notion that schizophrenia may be partly caused by the effects of such structural changes in genes both across the whole genome and in specific chromosomes
114663 we anticipate a breakthrough in the near future in research into psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia bipolar disease and autism at the same i wish to stress that in such a complex disease as schizophrenia there is a need for research on both genetic and environmental causes and on treatment and management
114664 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
114665 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
114666 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
114667 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack

114675 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
114676 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
114677 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
114678 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
114679 this is a seminal discovery the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
114680 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise
114681 it has been a privilege to collaborate with kevin eggan and his team and to contribute to this critical step forward we will continue to work hand in hand with harvard researchers and project a l s to exploit the potential of these cells for drug screening

114687 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
114688 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
114689 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
114690 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
114691 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
114692 the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow in the past six months alone criminal gangs have attacked 12 un humanitarian convoys resulting in the loss of food for thousands of the poorest families
114693 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
114694 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment
114695 the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
114696 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

114703 how we survive is what makes us who we are
114704 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
114705 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
114706 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
114707 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
114708 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
114709 my commitment was to withdraw even from literary life and all sorts of public life
114710 it is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach here

114714 initially the seals were guided to one of the brighter stars by a laser pointer and encouraged to swim towards it
114715 with a little practice the seals swam in the right direction 100percent of the time
114716 seals might learn the position of the stars relative to foraging grounds during dawn and dusk when they can see both the stars and landmarks at the coast
114717 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
114718 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
114719 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
114720 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
114721 we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
114722 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
114723 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
114724 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv
114725 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease

114733 xgnp can either be used as an additive to plastics or by itself it can make a transformational change in the performance of many advanced electronic and energy devices it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
114734 now that we know how to make this material and how to modify it so that it can be utilized in plastics our attention is being directed to high end applications where we can really make some substantial changes in the way electronics fuel cells batteries and solar cells perform as a result of using this material
114735 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
114736 what we do not know is if garlic works as well as pills over the long term or if it would reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke but i was surprised at the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with garlic
114737 there is no harm in taking garlic along with other lifestyle factors such as eating less red meat less salt less alcohol and taking more exercise and also continuing to take blood pressure medication
114738 anyone could benefit from regular doses of garlic but it is important not to assume that taking supplements is all you need to treat high blood pressure
114739 if you have high blood pressure and are overweight then it is important to take regular exercise and eat a healthy diet
114740 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
114741 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
114742 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance

114747 the elephant death rate from poaching throughout africa is about 8 percent a year based on recent studies which is actually higher than the 7 4 percent annual death rate that led to the international ivory trade ban nearly 20 years ago
114748 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
114749 with such information authorities can beef up enforcement efforts and focus them in specific areas where poaching is known to occur as a means of preventing elephants from being killed
114750 but that will only happen if there is sufficient public pressure to marshal funding for a much larger international effort to halt the poaching
114751 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
114752 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
114753 today there is a realization amongst saarc countries that it is only by cooperating within saarc that we will be able to strengthen ourselves individually and as a region and address the many common challenges that face us
114754 at the 14th saarc summit in new delhi we had agreed to move saarc from a phase of declaration to a phase of implementation and action as part of this approach several initiatives have been taken notably the establishment of the saarc development fund the saarc food bank the proposal to establish a south asian university safta and greater people to people contacts
114755 i am confident that the forthcoming summit will consolidate these gains and provide an impetus to the implementation of the many decisions that are in place
114756 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
114757 mars is giving us some surprises were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from
114758 one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
114759 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
114760 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
114761 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
114762 this is a drug that is like pharmacological exercise we were blown away after four weeks of receiving the drug the mice were behaving as if they had been exercised
114763 drugs that improve health are not only going to be used by people who have medical problems they may also be used by people who are healthy or by athletes who want an edge
114764 they want to revert back to more classic commercials for the traditionalists
114765 construction is going on in full swing to promote tourism so the sources from which the water used to flow into the lake are depleting as a result bhimtal lake is drying up slowly earlier it used to be filled with water during the monsoons but now as you can see only 1 3rd of the lake is filled with water
114766 we had organised a national championship here and we want to make these championships a regular feature in this lake so we are making efforts to restore this lake to its earlier glory the government will provide all the necessary help

114769 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
114770 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease
114771 climate model simulations are unable to replicate such cold tropical conditions for this time period
114772 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
114773 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
114774 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
114775 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes
114776 this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time

114806 must be balanced against the need for the police and other authorities to have adequate powers to safeguard the proper functioning of parliament and protect the amenity value of parliament square
114807 the committee supports the governments objective of making government more accountable to parliament and we welcome the draft bill as the first step towards achieving that goal
114808 while we commend the efforts made by the government our report highlights those issues which in our view require further work before the bill will be ready for introduction in the next session of parliament
114809 for the avoidance of doubt i didnt cover that political gig
114810 but it is not by the consolidation or concentration of powers but by their distribution that good government is effected were not this great country already divided into states that division must be made that each might do for itself what concerns itself directly and what it can so much better do than a distant authority every state again is divided into counties each to take care of what lies within its local bounds each county again into townships or wards to manage minuter details and every ward into farms to be governed each by its individual proprietor were we directed from washington when to sow amp when to reap we should soon want bread it is by this partition of cares descending in gradation from general to particular that the mass of human affairs may be best managed for the good and prosperity of all
114811 its a good thing to let you meet our politicians on our home ground
114812 the audience of about 100 people represented a cross section of community interest and political opinion but friend and foe appeared to appreciate the governments efforts to come to them
114813 itll be a bit like question time anyone who opens his mouth will have his factional interest identified at once
114814 i love my country as much as the next man and am proud to be both british and scottish
114815 youre about as old hat as a hat can get
114816 alex salmonds cabinet are being paraded around scotland a little like a travelling political circus
114817 many of us post reasonable topics questions certainly over the last couple of days i have posed several questions fairly and frankly and without predjudice
114818 there seems to be an unholy row going on between labour and the national socialists
114819 careful with the hyperbole or someone might think that you are the angry man
114820 nor did i suggest that the audience was hand picked by the snp
114821 a division into two especially mutually exclusive or contradictory groups wrote
114822 if you had read my post you would understand my feelings on being labelled as british thus you would understand why i see it as a dichotomy i dont feel that it is perfectly consistent to be both
114823 two nations claim scotland scots and british they both cant win
114824 im clearly more nationalistic than many native scots but genetically indisposed to appreciate any irony involved
114825 who governs us under what banner is far less important than what they do we need to be focussing on dealing with scotlands problems solving them and moving on fighting the battles of the future not wallowing around in the past
114826 who governs us under what banner is far less important than what they do
114827 someone can be texan and american at the same time after all
114828 the future of scotland lies in getting good quality politicans working towards solving scotlands problems the last thing we need is another governmental reorganisation and the upheval and cost that that will entail
114829 the british constitution is the best that ever was since the creation of the world and it is not possible to make it better yet mr muir has gone among the ignorant country people and told them parliamentary reform was absolutely necessary for preserving their liberty
114830 it is hugely simplistic to believe that the problems scotland faces are going to magically disappear overnight with a yes vote in a referendum
114831 promises may get thee friends but nonperformance will turn them into enemies
114832 the old way is better weve always done it this way
114833 does the snp have a vested interest in the present system failing rather than trying to make it work
114834 what a sad life you must lead you seem to see no good in your world
114835 but does the snp have a vested interest in the present system failing rather than trying to make it work
114836 yes independence now and thought about the details later i wouldnt now
114837 the current lot have now let snh loose on the best site in scotland to create conservation areas in the best bits
114838 a junkie without access to his stash is in a state of crisis the energy crisis that exists intermittently when the flow of fuel from unstable countries is cut off or threatened is a crisis in the same sense when such a crisis is perceived in the western sphere there are normally two solutions proposed relieve our dependence on foreign fuels by developing ecologically friendly energy extraction technology or send an army to pacify the fuel rich region in question both of these paths seemingly at odds with each other take as fundamentally true a certain proposition that in no circumstances should we use less energy than we already use in this conception all human problems must be solved by the impressment of still more energy slaves to meet the expanding demand of human masters the two solutions consist of securing the current source of the drug or finding a different more secure pusher
114839 we are burying our heads over this issue the french are going to build new nuclear plants and then we buy the electicity so we are in fact supporting nuclear power but just not in our backyard
114840 a referendum on independence has no bearing on births deaths or spendthrift lifestyle
114841 if we are to attract the inward investment to drive scotland forward it has to be fuelled uncertainty in this area will put potential investors off again we have much rhetoric little real policy that will make a diference the whole debate is characterised by emotion and little fact politics works best when based on realism

114846 in general the trend is to tax improvements which have generally been paid for out of already taxed funds rather than bare site value my preference wrote 220 old nat now thats a can o worms ordinary folk like me are not clever enough or informed enough to contemplate the nuances of complicated legislation i would suspect most of our msps feel the same even parliaments lawyers are merely attempting to interpret politicians will and the msps like me are not really capable of knowing if its right i dont think with respect to them todays parliament has the expertise i think you were right about reform as opposed to abolition by and large laws and statutes have edged forward over centuries going back to the common law in england and roman law in scotland well meaning people however bright tamper at their peril wrote 173 northhighlander wrote i agree that the key to the future is to use less energy much effort is required to reduce our energy useage
114847 changes in energy consumption are not going to happen overnight
114848 scotland requires a coherant realistic energy policy that embraces the need to change consumption habits but also how we are to generate renewables will forma a part of that policy but cannot be realisticaly seen as the mainstay of the policy
114849 i dont believe the technology is sufficiently developed to replace large generators like torness and hunterston in the next 10 years

114851 we are delighted to be negotiating with canary wharf for a new building which we intend to be a premier facility in the heart of a premier financial district
114852 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
114853 already we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with non censored reporting of the games we are in the process of getting websites which were previously blocked unblocked
114854 there will be sites blocked that have to do with pornography or where in the opinion of the national government are sites which are subversive or against national interest and thats normal in most countries in the world
114855 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
114856 it seemed like it would give some of the people who worked for us more career options
114857 id love to be able to take credit for it but i dont think weve innovated too significantly i think you might even call it a happy accident
114858 ones competitive spirit is slightly piqued when someone else does well with a movie and you think why didnt we have that
114859 however when you stand back and look at it from a general point of view tell no one shows that this idea that people have stopped going to a certain kind of movie is just not right
114860 we have decided to move forward with a number of our productions and address any issues later as they arise
114861 everyone is working under the assumption that nothing will happen until there is an election and the results are known
114862 i think sag thought lets drag this into july and august lets force the studios to make a mistake maybe theyll impose maybe theyll lock us out and that will galvanize the members and then well get a strike vote that didnt happen
114863 its a two way street the amptp knows where to find us
114864 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
114865 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
114866 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
114867 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
114868 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
114869 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
114870 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
114871 i could never have imagined achieving anything like this when i first came to manchester united
114872 i worked for the best manager of all time sir alex ferguson i played with the best players in the world and in front of the best supporters
114873 i am very proud of what i achieved but very humble as well that i was given the opportunity to do that
114874 maybe these kids have some respect for us because they know us from united
114875 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
114876 it was pure instinct i had never even done it in practice i was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball so i didnt know it was going in thankfully it did liverpool in the fa cup earlier that season and i got the winner then so while we were surprised to beat bayern it wasnt a shock that we achieved it in the way we did
114877 three years before i came on as a substitute in the fa cup final against millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for united
114878 i knew i needed another operation and i just felt that would be it
114879 so to win the premier league again one that my eldest son noah was old enough to remember gave me something i will always treasure
114880 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
114881 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
114882 but you take little bits but he has seen and done everything and i have tried to learn from the way he never panics
114883 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
114884 i do not believe there is anyone who does not know that i am in the detention unit
114885 those are lies i do not comment on any longer

114916 this excellent book which presents the most important branches of modern spatial statistics in an exemplary manner will become a basic reference book and will popularize many methods which have been used until now only by small circles of specialists
114917 the majority of geoscientists should make sure they have access to this volume while for those who are actively involved in applying statistical methods to data of all sorts this book should be in their personal libraries as a compendium of statistical procedures to use to analyze data this volume will surely provide a good solid framework for some time to come

114956 the erosion of corporate earnings has become obvious we are getting short of stocks we want to buy based on earnings either among exporters or domestic demand companies

114958 the cabinet reshuffle wont be negative for the market as things cant get worse
114959 investors reacted negatively to the worse than expected u s gdp gross domestic product data
114960 overall corporate earnings were weak due to rising oil prices and slowing global demand and investors were pessimistic that earnings would remain sluggish later in the year
114961 the global economic outlook is deteriorating and corporate earnings are also getting worse together they are creating selling pressure
114962 this has been a week of unusually low turnover with investors unable to find any investment ideas
114963 now investors are clear that nothing will change fundamentally for as long as u s housing prices and sales keep on the decline all the measures taken so far have only worked around this problem without looking to fix it

114975 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
114976 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years

115005 he would probably want you to have this poor guy he stared t it almost every night
115006 he looked at this every night you said that that poor guy he knew someone he loved would kill him so he pushed us all away
115007 he loved me more than anything in the world and wouldnt tell me because he was afraid it would kill him to love somebody
115008 avouez ce que vous avez fait je vous en prie
115009 we continue to invest at record levels to bring new supplies to the market
115010 our congress needs to give us access to areas currently off limits to the industry
115011 the best way to bring downward pressure on prices is by bringing on new supply while doing everything we can to use energy efficiently
115012 whats shocking is that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production or investing in alternative energy
115013 why do they need more land to drill on when all their money is going into buying up stock
115014 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
115015 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
115016 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
115017 die ger chte ber ihren gesundheitszustand sind dramatisierend bertrieben und unwahr ihr krankenhausaufenthalt ist vorbeugend sie wird in k rze nach hause zur ckkehren
115018 durch diese transaktion kann sich die bmw group mehr auf ihr kerngesch ft konzentrieren
115019 we believe this is a fair full and compelling offer
115020 when you start to see a pickup in deal activity it becomes a competitive response
115021 you see competitors being more aggressive they dont want to be left behind
115022 das ist nach anf nglichen problemen bis zum 3 4 mit dann vier toren in serie doch recht gut gelaufen
115023 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
115024 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
115025 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
115026 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
115027 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
115028 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
115029 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
115030 i dont know if we were going to move him up or down but well start there
115031 we believe the new shape of this tariff structure will capture the important growth arising from the major shift towards statistical arbitrage and algorithmic trading in uk equity markets this continues to be a major driver of change in market micro structure driving overall growth and significantly improving market efficiency by reducing total transaction cost thereby decreasing the cost of capital for the companies listed on our market

115038 wir appellieren an das internationale olympische komitee und vor allem an die verantwortlichen auf chinesischer seite eine unbehinderte berichterstattung zu garantieren
115039 wenn jetzt die arbeit unserer eigenen korrespondenten am austragungsort der olympischen spiele eingeschr nkt wird dann ist dies eine neue dimension von zensur gegen die wir uns mit unseren mitteln zur wehr setzen m ssen
115040 damit hat sich best tigt was gregor gysi von anfang an erkl rte dass die behauptung von frau birthler falsch und eine ble nachrede ist
115041 hinreichende tats chliche anhaltspunkte daf r ergeben dass der ge u erte verdacht zutrifft
115042 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
115043 the ioc has always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
115044 the media are now able to access sites to do their job
115045 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfil the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
115046 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
115047 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
115048 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
115049 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
115050 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
115051 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
115052 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
115053 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
115054 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
115055 our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations
115056 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
115057 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
115058 when i picked up last weeks paper and read the story about the couple from georgetown who spend 500 per month visiting their premature baby at an edinburgh hospital it brought back memories
115059 it will be a long hard struggle for the couple but if they stay strong they will get through it bailey can be prone to infections but apart from that he is like any other two year old
115060 we are going to put our heads together and come up with fundraising ideas we are already looking at a sponsored walk or fun run and hope to get started within the next month we are really dedicated to this and hope we can raise a good amount of cash and get the locals involved
115061 st johnstone dunfermline partick thistle theyve all been bringing in fresh players strengthening their teams
115062 i dont think the first division will have been stronger
115063 you are always a bit nervous about making predictions on the back of pre season but i honestly think this is the strongest squad we have had at queen of the south in the last seven years and thats no disrespect to past managers
115064 we have a really professional team in gordon chisholm kenny brannigan peter latchford and billy dodds and i think the decision to go full time made a huge difference
115065 with our new signings i really feel we are looking good
115066 the scottish cup uefa or cis it doesnt matter they are the competitions where you can make some money i would hope that we can have another run like last season
115067 i think most people realise we cannot run the club on the income from home gates alone
115068 so we are hoping we can find someone to take over the old tesco site but its a big building and so far we have not been able to find anyone the council doesnt have any use for it
115069 we will keep trying but it might mean we have to look at alternative uses i would think it would have to be something that would be of benefit to the community
115070 whatever we decide it will have to be something that will be sustainable beyond a year or 18 months
115071 its always great to win that first league encounter and get three points on the board especially in front of our own fans
115072 in the latter stages of last season we turned palmerston into a fortress and i want it to be like that again
115073 i know the airdrie manager kenny black very well and im sure hed love to come down and surprise us
115074 the opening league match is always a hard one to predict but airdrie have a lot of new faces in their squad and well be facing somewhat of an unknown quantity
115075 id like to think we could improve on last seasons fourth place but there will be some pretty tough competition out there
115076 i saw st johnstone play burnley and they looked pretty good they have a fair squad which gives them lots of options
115077 dundee of course can never be ruled out and personally i think it could be tighter than ever at the top this time around
115078 although we havent had a lot of time to prepare for the season we have brought together a good group of lads and we want them all to enjoy what will be history for the club
115079 having already looked after stirling albion for a number of seasons it is great for us to link up with an another team with a great future ahead of them
115080 the use of the motorbikes is not only down to young people
115081 it may lead to them being reported to the procurator fiscal in the case of an adult or the reporter to the childrens panel for someone under 16 years of age

115087 i know its not everyones cup of tea but its an extremely effective way of generating power at this moment
115088 most people see the benefits and some people see the disadvantages
115089 a couple of managers had to be called in to sort out problems with the deliveries and one of them was actually doing the deliveries as there was no else to do it
115090 around 250 hours have been cut although no one has been paid off
115091 we are working less hours but there is still the same amount of mail to be delivered
115092 a full office revision has been carried out in dumfries delivery office and there have been some changes to duty structures which have been introduced with full and negotiated agreement with staff and the cwu
115093 the new structure takes account of technology introduced to increase the amount of mail sorted by machinery and transport legislation which has changed the way mail flows through our network
115094 deliveries will continue to be completed in line with our specification of lunchtime for urban areas and mid afternoon in rural communities
115095 perhaps this will soon turn out to be a blessing
115096 perhaps this will soon turn out to be a cause of misfortune
115097 perhaps this will soon turn out to be a blessing
115098 daddy can i learn to play the world of warcraft powerleveling

115103 we had just bought some sausage rolls and were walking through the town centre eating them when we were attacked
115104 two of them were flapping above our heads and a third tried to snatch what was left of the sausage roll out of my daughters hand and she was quite viciously nipped which left her with a cut on her hand
115105 shelley was hysterical and screaming when the seagull went for her and although she cut her hand it could have been even worse if the gulls had caught any of us in the face
115106 luckily my husband managed to hit two of the gulls away and by the time we got home her hand had stopped bleeding
115107 i know you could say that we were probably only attacked because we were carrying the food but to be honest you should expect to be able to walk down the street on a sunday afternoon and have a bite to eat if you want to do that
115108 there is a genuine concern about this contaminated type of heroin circulating in the area and there is a real danger to those who use the drug intravenously
115109 any effects not normally associated with heroin abuse being experienced by users should be reported to medical practitioners as soon as possible
115110 this warning has gone out across all the agencies and partners in dumfries and galloway who work with people who use heroin including of course needle exchange outlets in the region
115111 let us play the man a trick we will hide his shoes and conceal ourselves behind those bushes and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them
115112 we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor but you are rich and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man put a wow gold into each shoe and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him
115113 are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick
115114 you have taught me a lesson which i will never forget

115118 following 6 successful months we are keen to keep the momentum up and assist those who visit the tracesmart site hoping to find relatives initially looking for lost relatives can seem a daunting task where in reality it neednt be we hope that by continuing with this project we will not only be able to reunite more people but inspire others to do it themselves
115119 a professional practice is mandatory to provide customers with our unique professional open source erp offering leading system integrators clearly match our companys strategy and we are very interested in meeting them face to face no matter their location in order to build a successful partnership together
115120 we wanted our staff to have cellular connectivity throughout the complex and we decided to purchase a system ourselves to speed deployment and provide multi carrier coverage
115121 adcs interreach unison system was clearly the best of the systems we evaluated because it offered high performance with high cost efficiency and it could support multiple carriers without requiring additional cabling
115122 our interreach unison product was created specifically to address the wireless coverage challenges of buildings larger than 250 000 square feet delivering strong and consistent performance in dense traffic environments
115123 like ministry lnv many of our customers are now choosing to purchase their own in building cellular systems to speed deployment of multi carrier coverage
115124 i was so impressed with the speed power and flexibility of smart ts xl that i decided that i wanted to market it in europe
115125 institutions have an it tool capable of searching and interrogating every nook and cranny of the enterprise
115126 we have some very impressive results from us firms that are using smart ts xl
115127 for example a major us airline took only 6 hours to complete a task using smart ts xl that would have taken 116 hours previously a major pharmaceutical company loading source code into ibm websphere was still not finished after 9 weeks but took less than 5 hours with smart ts xl a leading bank was facing a bill of 40 000 and 3 weeks to process changes to standard documents called by a number of programs but was able to reduce this to 50 and complete the job in just 30 minutes using our software these are such spectacular results that i defy any institution to find a more efficient enterprise search system than smart ts xl
115128 we chose smart ts xl because we believe that it is the best software of this type on the market the fact that it saves both time and money makes it a great incentive especially in the current climate us clients quickly achieved major cost savings and improvements in efficiency and i expect european companies will see numerous opportunities to save time and money and take advantage of the immediate benefits offered by the product
115129 etc is one of the uks leading distributors in the uk and we are delighted that our partnership is already paying such high dividends with the growing number of resellers signing up to offer our technology more and more uk business operating microsoft exchange will be able to benefit from teneros simple cost effective exchange continuity solutions we look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with etc in both the uk and the eu markets

115136 during the past year we have put a lot of time and resource into fleshing out the lunartics story we have done this by further developing their environment with the seven new zones and the story books in addition we are now set to launch the trading cards game which we believe together with our interactive website will fuel demand for lunartics merchandise
115137 these extensions to the lunartics range and the new display options for the lunartics characters presents a more exciting and compelling proposition to our licensees
115138 wowza provides infrastructure grade streaming server software that allows us to deliver superior enterprise media asset management solutions for our clients prior to wowza our options for offering streaming were severely constrained and the limitations or high costs posed problems for the ongoing development of focusopen we extensively tested a number of open and closed source competitive streaming servers and found that wowza offers the best combination of functionality reliability versatility and price
115139 wowzas server side programming gives us an immense advantage providing the flexibility to deliver complex timeline metadata operations video documentation and logging
115140 the inclusion of h 264 aac and interoperability with media encoders is very significant and has enabled us to deliver production quality web based media asset management tools that can expand the capabilities of our focusopen digital asset management platform substantially over anything our competitors have been able to offer
115141 the scalability and security features of wowza are crucial for use in corporate environments our clients are justifiably uncompromising about availability and security many have regulatory compliance requirements that cannot be ignored taking risks with untested systems that havent been developed without a rigorous approach just isnt an option for us
115142 we are delighted with the service received from wowza the available documentation support and backup provided is excellent i foresee daydream continuing to use wowza pro for a long time other competitors in the streaming market will have to seriously raise their game before we will look elsewhere
115143 we reviewed a number of providers of retail systems eurostop met our requirements and was recommended by others in the retail market
115144 the system is easy to use and comes with proven credentials it had the key features that we required and saves us time and money by helping us to operate efficiently the team at eurostop is very knowledgeable about our market they were very approachable and made the whole implementation easy and trouble free
115145 eurostops solution is ideal for the independent retailer and those starting new ventures it provides an easy to use system that enables retailers to closely monitor and control stock throughput as they expand so the stores can utilise the stock management functionality to monitor trends and also engage with customers by creating loyalty programmes starting with such systems in place helps companies to expand in a controlled and managed way ensuring best service and maximum profitability
115146 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
115147 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
115148 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
115149 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
115150 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
115151 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater

115184 we had a meeting with ochoa to tell him we refused the offer from everton and galatasarays proposal was just unsatisfactory
115185 neither us nor the player think that a loan for a player of the quality of ochoa is something serious
115186 we have arranged with ochoa that beside the fact he has a contract with america until 2010 if an important offer appears next year we will do all we can do to transfer him

115192 akhirnya anwar memilih kawasan selamat untuk bertanding di kerusi parlimen walaupun pada awalnya beliau pernah berkata tidak akan minta presiden pkr wan azizah wan ismail memberi laluan kepadanya
115193 selepas itu anwar buat kenyataan kemungkinan besar bertanding di bandar tun razak dan kemudiannya di kulim
115194 kalau betul anwar diterima di seluruh negara kenapa tidak menunaikan janji kepada rakyat kulim untuk bertanding di sana
115195 ini mesti kerana anwar tidak yakin dengan penerimaan rakyat terhadapnya terutama sekali dengan beberapa isu yang melibatkan beliau akhir akhir ini
115196 anwar kini tidak yakin dengan penerimaan rakyat terutama sekali dengan beberapa isu yang melibatkan beliau akhir akhir ini
115197 a plot of land as big as 10 6 acres is too large to be given only to an individual which should not have happened

115232 hijrah ke madinah adalah perintah allah yang umum kepada semua kaum muslimin makkah yang kuat mahu pun yang tertindas untuk menyelamatkan diri dan agamanya bahkan allah mengancam mereka yang tetap tinggal di makkah dalam kondisi tertindas dengan adzab jahannam
115233 sesungguhnya orang orang yang diwafatkan malaikat dalam keadaan menzalimi diri sendiri malaikat bertanya kepada mereka dalam keadaan bagaimana kamu ini mereka menjawab kami adalah orang orang yang tertindas di negeri makkah para malaikat berkata bukankah bumi allah itu luas sehingga kamu dapat berhijrah di bumi itu orang orang itu tempatnya neraka jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
115234 kecuali mereka yang tertindas baik laki laki atau wanita ataupun anak anak yang tidak mampu berdaya upaya dan tidak mengetahui jalan untuk hijrah mereka itu mudah mudahan allah memaafkannya dan adalah allah maha pemaaf lagi maha pengampun
115235 dan tiada seorang pun daripadamu melainkan mendatangi neraka itu hal itu bagi tuhanmu adalah suatu kemestian yang sudah ditetapkan
115236 kemudian kami akan menyelamatkan orang orang yang bertakwa dan membiarkan orang orang yang zalim di dalam neraka dalam keadaan berlutut

115339 we are definitely in the game on top i would say
115340 we were really disappointed to get washed out because we could have really pushed on and batted a long way past them
115341 there is still a lot of time left in this game there are six sessions of cricket the pitch is deteriorating already and it will be tough to bat on come the last day

115345 hes been up to aberdeen to have part of the medical but we always knew his knee wouldnt pass a medical and aberdeen were aware of the situation once his knee is fit he will have the rest of his medical and hell be away
115346 his situation is the same as david stockdales we got a good fee for stocky and now hes going to the premier league with fulham
115347 its a great chance for him to push his career on and its the scenario with tommy
115348 i chose sunderland ahead of portsmouth because i came here and saw the training facilities and the stadium and i know what this club is capable of
115349 as long as the players believe in themselves theres no reason why we cant finish in the top ten or maybe even the top eight
115350 if we do that we will be looking to go even higher the following year
115351 but we finished fifth or sixth in the first season and i knew that was what we were capable of sunderland are in the same position
115352 its a long time since sunderland have played european football but why should it not be possible
115353 the club needs time it needs two or three years to really build itself up but we have start that process this season and aim to finish in the top eight
115354 i am similar to roy keane because he used to be a bad loser as well
115355 i know opposition supporters like to hate me but i am totally comfortable with that no matter what team i am playing against anywhere in the world the opposition supporters do not make me welcome
115356 but thats because they know me they know who i am and what i am capable of
115357 i like to wind the opposition up and if i know people are ready to boo me i want to score against them and play well for my fans i know the sunderland supporters will support me and that is all that is important
115358 whether we can continue to produce the numbers we have consistently is open to question
115359 you inevitably have some years where the crop are more talented than others

115361 theres a lot of talent and sometimes that talent just needs an opportunity these lads know they will get a chance with us
115362 there are seven substitutes in the premier league next year so more of them will have a chance to be with the squad
115363 goalkeepers like carson and robinson only made their reputations by being given an opportunity
115364 im well aware the goalkeeping situation is unquestionably the biggest talking point whenever i meet boro supporters at the moment but i havent seen a goalkeeper available who is better than the two we have
115365 thats not just my view thats the view of all the staff

115410 that was of course exactly what he was supposed to do it was cable tv for goodness sake discussions there are supposed to be fast and loud compton tells me he thought he was being aggressive not rude thats not the way my mother would see it but i agree with bob i just wasnt ready
115411 i interviewed compton and responded to his film twice in a
115412 many economists argued i said that our social political and economic freedoms not our education system make us more productive and creative than other countries

115414 vivek wadhwa a high tech entrepreneur teaching at duke university has shared with me some of his research and his occasional e mail exchanges with compton wadhwa like compton is a successful businessman with a first hand grasp of the difficulties american companies have finding engineering talent he tells both sides supporting compton on some points and criticizing him on others
115415 what the us can learn from indian r amp d
115416 what is happening in india and china is that private companies not public school systems are doing the training that is producing the technical elite building those economies wadhwa said
115417 all they are doing now is to blame our teachers and put the burden on our children
115418 i hope i am in better shape if compton and i have a rematch
115419 but whatever the outcome it wont mean much i encourage scholars and journalists living china and india to further examine those economies and education systems and give us something more than two week visit impressions
115420 personally i think prosperity in other parts of the world is good news it means happier people with more choices it may even mean more freedom and less war compton and i agree that would be a good thing

115517 at any one time there are more than 150 computers and servers in use on the network so the potential for infection is pretty high when i came on board the school was using symantecs norton antivirus to keep the network clean while the software has a good reputation for ease of use my experience with the product was not too good at keeping viruses out
115518 we contacted the avg us office to ask their advice on who might be the best supplier for us to work with
115519 they pointed us in the direction of walling data because they not only specialized in providing avg products and support to the education market but also offered significant discounts to educational institutions it sounded like a winning combination to me
115520 by the time we came to install avg anti virus network edition on the network we had viruses on 120 of our computers thats 75 of the schools pcs and the infections were spreading like wildfire
115521 it seemed that every time we booted the network another system would fall victim to the epidemic once the avg software was up and running it was busy for 12 to 14 hours quarantining and rescanning all of our computers to make sure that they were clean and free of all traces of the viruses within the first day of buying avg it proved to us that it was money well spent
115522 the decision to switch to avg protection was definitely the right move for us
115523 the software is extremely easy to use and the remote administration tool makes it a simple task for me to check the security status of any machine on the network on the few occasions when ive come across a function i couldnt quite figure out a quick call to walling datas no cost support has cleared things up for me in just minutes wallings service has been impeccable and we could not have asked for a better return on investment for this combination of protection professionalism and performance

115626 no nation has ever enjoyed lasting peace and stability or could ever survive when only a few of its citizens wallow in wealth and affluence at par with the rich of other nations while the rest of its citizens are entrapped in poverty the simple truth is that the above reality obtains more in the north than other parts of the country

115641 malawi is a very poor country but it is registering credible economic growth and the macro economic conditions look quite good when other countries are stagnating we are pleased with the performance and our allocation of resources is based on that
115642 again based on performance of countries like malawi were the fertiliser subsidy has been very intelligently used it is our obligation to support such countries and i want to confirm that we will do that

115680 oh obama you are just sooo damn popular but you dont deserve the support that is coming your way
115681 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
115682 in the imagining of a post apocalyptic world you do have unfortunately a lot of references that we can go to today
115683 war torn countries and third world countries where people dont have access to basic clean food and water and necessities and medical provisions and thats something to kind of examine i think for us to say ok yes were making a picture about totally devastating circumstances but the fact that it does reflect things that are going on currently in this privileged world that were living in where there hasnt been an apocalypse and robots havent taken over the world i mean i think thats something definitely for us to re investigate and to continue to make choices for our own future

115696 to not be present at either misano or brno for me was very hard but it was indeed impossible to ride
115697 our operations and reliability improved in the quarter and included successful completion of planned turnarounds in the upstream and downstream businesses
115698 we continue to focus on our high quality portfolio of company growth projects and have received federal authorization for the kearl oil sands project to proceed
115699 the red lake mine is such an important part of our company and this acquisition locks into place an important piece of our future
115700 this transaction secures for goldcorp full control of eight kilometres of strike length in the heart of the worlds richest high grade gold district
115701 development of this strategically important zone can now move forward with our adjoining assets as a single comprehensive project sharing mine infrastructure ore processing facilities and human talent with red lake thus minimizing capital and operating costs and maximizing long term shareholder value
115702 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
115703 we feel very good about harlequin and its prospects it is a great business with outstanding free cash flow and significant ambitions for growth beyond its core through expansion in non fiction international expansion and digital initiatives
115704 as the foreign exchange cloud lifts and harlequin delivers steady multi year growth we anticipate there will be greater market recognition of the value of this fine global franchise
115705 adding growth platforms like magazines directories coupons consumer shows and digital initiatives
115706 harlequin delivered an excellent quarter with higher revenues and unit sales leading to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization growth of 44 per cent metroland media group also returned to its growth track with revenue and profit growth and finished the quarter with a strong june and positive momentum
115707 projects with rising carbon intensity are most at risk of exceeding mandatory targets and investors in these projects are exposed to financial risk from energy and carbon costs
115708 should oil prices fall to 65 a barrel for instance then carbon costs would almost wipe out profits
115709 production is becoming more and more of a concern for these guys access to reserves is a very big issue
115710 under the existing climate policy framework extracting oil from oil sands projects will remain highly profitable
115711 its disconcerting given that almost every early indicator we had was pointing to modest growth and to basically have every missing piece of the puzzle wind up on the down side is unnerving it does suggest there is some very real underlying weakness here in the economy
115712 the softness thus far has been so highly concentrated in one sector net trade that it has failed to infiltrate ontarios core domestic economy
115713 nobody in this room i dont give a shit what you say in your heart of hearts agrees in its entirety on the magna deal that caused us a great deal of stress and pressure within the local unions within the staff within the leadership of our union
115714 boy ive never had a knife put in me deeper than that one because nobody else has ever said that to me

115717 i think it is the best class to be in before moving to motogp and i dont want the 250cc class to change

115724 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
115725 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

115735 the modern weapons are loaded by a cartridge but this has to be loaded by a ball down the muzzle one shot at a time
115736 it was made in st louis for people on their way west they took this with them because of the size of the bore the barrel was short and the ball could take down a buffalo or an attacker
115737 in the 1820s and 1830s people were just going west they had opened up all this land and people said they could make a living out here but there was no water and they couldnt grow vegetables and they had to live off meat they hunted and if you made it past 20 to 30 years old you were an old man
115738 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
115739 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
115740 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

115772 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
115773 an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value
115774 we encourage you to act with the best interests of your shareholders in mind in a responsible and prudent manner and to abandon this acquisition

115778 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
115779 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
115780 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
115781 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
115782 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
115783 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
115784 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
115785 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
115786 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
115787 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

115790 streets of no return the dark cinema of david goodis
115791 when we gave the mice a small amount of daily exercise in the presence or not of the drug all showed an increased ability to run but those on the drug gained an additional hour
115792 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
115793 its basically the couch potato experiment and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise
115794 the drug by itself had no impact on running ability
115795 we were blown away that aicar alone mimicked exercise not to the same level but a healthy boost
115796 we believe that the strategy of re organizing the preset genetic imprint of muscle as well as other tissues using exercise mimetic drugs has therapeutic potential in treating certain muscle diseases such as wasting and frailty as well as obesity where exercise is known to be beneficial
115797 w hat captivates even mesmerizes is the films portrayal of revolution and religion as conjoined elements of the mexican character
115798 the nations newly secured post colonial masculinity especially in the period following the nationalization of the countrys natural resources and key industries that significantly altered mexicos neocolonial status in relation to the united states
115799 the social transformations ushered in by the armed struggle and fight against feudal caciquismo and on the familial divisions caused by cross class cross ethnic cross regional romantic alliances
115800 an important narrative trope in many of the revolutionary melodramas from the classic period
115801 is the revolutions civilizing mission this theme is especially prevalent in fern ndezs films the civilizing mission takes various forms in enamorada the civilizing mission is about domesticating and feminizing female characters deemed to be too independent too disobedient and thus too masculinized as is the case in most films starring mar a f lix dubbed la devoradora de hombres the man eater including the aforementioned film in enamorada famously based on shakespeares taming of the shrew and on an episode in don juan manuels spanish medieval era narrative el conde lucanor in order for the cross class lovers to form part of the revolutionary family they both must undergo major transformations the proud feisty and arrogant upper class beatriz pe afiel f lix needs to be less rebellious and more obedient to the new revolutionary patriarchal order general juan jos reyes armend riz needs to be less brutish less macho and more spiritual and meek unconditional love tames the ex seminarian general reyes as does his recovered spirituality achieved through his gradual respect for the catholic church general reyess spiritual rebirth is represented in a stunning sequence filmed in the interior of a baroque church he must renounce his threat of taking by force the conservative city of cholula famous for its 365 churches beatriz must surrender her class privileges renounce her marriage engagement to a u s suitor admit that general reyes has indeed won her over and join the revolution by taking her place behind general reyess horse as a soldadera

115806 figueroa conceived of photography as interpretive likening it to an actors rendering of a script he argued that though the camera ought to be essentially unobtrusive it must establish a dialogue with the spectators through the vigor force and beauty it creates
115807 get to invent countries visually with the images they create
115808 figueroa had as great an influence in shaping modern mexican identity as the muralists diego rivera jos clemente orozco and david alfaro siqueiros and photographer manuel lvarez bravo whose images deeply influenced him he also drew on the idealized landscapes of painter jos mar a velasco and the satiric drawings of master caricaturist jos guadalupe posada
115809 j ust as john ford used the backdrop of monument valley to define the classic american western figueroa invested mexican landmarks with operatic grandeur that monumentalizing tendency yoked to an autocratic government run industry has exposed figueroa to charges that he was as much of a propagandist as an artist several prominent mexican intellectuals and film scholars have criticized figueroas approach as overly stylized and inflexible which they equate with the rigid government sanctioned messages of the movies themselves

115820 the reason for this is that women lack concrete means for organizing themselves into a unit which can stand face to face with the correlative unit they have no past no history no religion of their own and they have no such solidarity of work and interests as that of the proletariat they are not even promiscuously herded together in the way that creates community feeling among the american negroes the ghetto jews the workers of saint denis or the factory hands of renault they live dispersed among the males attached through residence housework economic condition and social standing to certain men fathers or husbands more firmly than they are to other women if they belong to the bourgeoisie they feel solidarity with men of that class not with proletarian women if they are white their allegiance is to white men not to negro women the proletariat can propose to massacre the ruling class and a sufficiently fanatical jew or negro might dream of getting sole possession of the atomic bomb and making humanity wholly jewish or black but woman cannot even dream of exterminating the males the bond that unites her to her oppressors is not comparable to any other the couple is a fundamental unity with its two halves riveted together and the cleavage of society along the line of sex is impossible

115877 initial media coverage from the recent canadian g8 launch event has been highly positive
115878 the lack of improvement in market access to emerging and developing countries for the foreseeable future is against the original goals of the current doha round and will undermine the competitiveness of the eu industries putting pressure on production costs and employment
115879 the result could be major job losses in the eu at the level of the manufacturers but also in the supply chain
115880 the currently discussed unfair and imbalanced trade deal would leave the eu industry no other choice than to revise its future investments in new models and r amp d to locations outside eu that are more cost efficient
115881 also additional investments will have to be made in major emerging economies as their markets will remain closed to imports through the use of flexibilities and the maintaining of peak tariffs the eu would clearly loose out as location for manufacturing
115882 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the e gaming photographic images market area forward
115883 i saw this coming luckily i know my job is safe and if worse comes to worse ill retire early and live off a modest pension organized labor is not concerned either since many e gaming photographic images syndicates hashed out reasonable deals with corporate leadership last year
115884 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our e gaming photographic images market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
115885 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
115886 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the e gaming photographic images consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions

115911 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
115912 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
115913 the us and the uk must at last come clean about the scope of extraordinary rendition and secret detention a violation of american and british law human rights standards and the rules and regulations of nato both congress and parliament must set the record straight about what happened at diego garcia phr knows from our twenty one year history of documenting torture around the world that secret detention opens the floodgates to torture and other gross human rights abuses
115914 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
115915 the cia and the department of defense categorically deny having interrogated any terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainee on diego garcia in any cases since september 11 2001 with the exceptions of the two cases in 2002 in which detainees transited diego garcia that previously have been disclosed to the uk government there have been no other instances in which terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainees transited or were held there

116006 immer mehr wird nun durch ypsilanti nahles und stegner der linkspartei hinterher gelaufen
116007 diese sorgen sind dem f hrungspersonal der spd anscheinend fremd sonst h tten sie das unw rdige ausschlussverfahren um das langj hrige engagierte spd mitglied wolfgang clement verhindert
116008 die spd wird damit immer mehr zu einer sozialistischen kaderpartei in der eine linke f hrungsclique kritischen wegbegleitern den mund verbietet
116009 der ausschluss von wolfgang clement ist damit ein weiterer meilenstein im zelbstzerst rungsprozess der deutschen sozialdemokratie
116010 when a friend or acquaintance mines your social network without permission for friends or romantic partners
116011 make new friends but keep the old one is silver and the other gold
116012 better to be up front than to go behind her back
116013 its good manners to ask your friend to join you the first and second time you hang out with the new person
116014 point out to your friend that spending time with just your new friend does not diminish your feelings for your old friend make an effort to spend time with each of them individually so your old friend wont feel left out or pushed aside
116015 as you start to spend time with your new friend realize that there will be hurt feelings talk to your original friend about what she may be feeling give her a chance to express her feelings dont get defensive this is a natural response
116016 let the first friend know that you still value your friendship with her
116017 but your friendship is different not better than the new one

116030 meanwhile theyve hired a couple of spaniards to play the terrorists while kate will be taken from her bed in the middle of the night wearing nothing but a flimsy nightie
116031 after being held for the best part of 20 minutes all hell will break lose when the sas crash through the windows chuck a couple of smoke bombs and shoot the spaniards

116093 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
116094 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
116095 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
116096 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
116097 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
116098 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
116099 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
116100 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care

116103 something that we havent had in my time with the club is a genuine out and out playmaker who can create opportunities and its good to have that string to our bow now
116104 apart from charlies ability on the park i think his experience off it was the thing that attracted me
116105 im 32 and i still want to win myself i like to win trophies and i think weve got a great bunch of boys here
116106 hopefully ill enjoy my football and have a laugh on the field
116107 but im here to be serious and win trophies no doubt about it
116108 the stories are there but i dont pay them any attention because my job is to coach everything else is down to the sporting director paco herrera
116109 however it wouldnt be a surprise if he left because when people are talking about these things its because theres something in them although nobody has said anything to me
116110 i know there was meeting but the positions of the two clubs were very different but im not going to focus on this matter
116111 im happy with his work rate hes a good footballer committed to his work and the group and always positive hes working as hard as he can as always
116112 i find that ajaxs style of football which is more focused on passing than playing long balls is something that british teams struggle to cope with
116113 they are used to more physical kick and rush football so i hope that our style is too much for them cardiff and sunderland
116114 im happy we maintained a good tempo and passed the ball well in the first half
116115 lukas knows he has to compete hard against the two other forwards to win a position in the team and i hope he can find some confidence in himself with those three goals he scored today
116116 it was a good experience for us although i have to admit a 4 2 defeat is not good at all
116117 we were in agreement with him but that is now worthless since stuttgart called it off

116124 our marketing strategy with fall release choke is to get all the chuck palahniuk fans in
116125 the problem is theres no real way to measure how big that base is
116126 sometimes that small group can be loyally fanatical and will never grow to the point of critical mass
116127 there are some shows youre never going to find profitability with no matter how much a fan base loves it
116128 the total number of people in the blog world is probably only a few hundred thousand and as much as they might hate to hear it for most movies thats not going to make the difference between a success and a failure
116129 you sit there and think six thousand people are cheering for us we must be doing something right
116130 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
116131 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that

116194 and on the phone you were bragging about having even more of a hold on him than that that somehow youd lied and trapped him into thinking you could ruin his friendship with emma and marat too you want him to do you some favour and you need to blackmail him to get him to agree have i got that right
116195 im not sure yet how to handle this but i cant let you go around lying and ruining other peoples lives id ask you to promise not to hurt anyone but im not sure you can be trusted
116196 does this mean youre going to report back to dad or aunt nicky
116197 i ought to you were sent here to keep you out of emmas life thats the main reason i let you stay now i find youve been plotting to ruin everything good in her life its not fair its not good enough if you do anything to hurt her i will never forgive you
116198 but youre my godfather not hers why are you taking her side
116199 and you can switch off the false waterworks im not impressed im going to leave you to think about what youve done already and what you were about to do i seriously advise you to rethink your next move when youve come to a decision you can find me in the garden
116200 youre not going to act all big brother and give him a hard time are you
116201 if it keeps my sister out of our way i will positively encourage him
116202 but it would make it easier if we didnt have to confine everything to the bedroom
116203 would it be considered in bad taste if i suggested he ask her to move in with him
116204 very bad taste shes your little sister youre supposed to look out for her a bit and theyve only just met
116205 oh well i guess youre right as usual miss know it all well just have to make sure we lock the door when were having fun
116206 im sorry i have to go the others will make sure you get back ok
116207 ill see you later tonight then ill make it up to you
116208 shell kill him if he cheats on her again it took a lot to forgive what he did last time she was so hurt
116209 do you realise how rude it is to speak in spanish when we dont understand
116210 dont worry you neednt say a word he was acting strange this morning about to make a call but stopped as soon as i came into the room hes with a girl isnt he
116211 after all he was very affectionate when he left and said hed see you later if hed been up to anything i think he would have looked more embarrassed
116212 or maybe hes just a good liar your loyalty is admirable dinara but it wouldnt be the first time
116213 shes someone he met a while ago in madrid she was hanging around the courts when you were with dmitry in california he said she was just a friend
116214 i think id like to go if one of you guys would give me a lift
116215 ill do it you and maria dont get much time together igor
116216 will you wait while i pack some stuff im going home
116217 are you sure you want to do that wouldnt it be better to wait and see what marat has to say about it it could be perfectly innocent when i saw her at the courts marat didnt seem to pay her much attention the only thing he did was drive us all nuts about missing you
116218 ive been so stupid and selfish i really dont know where my head has been these past few months
116219 so youve made up your mind about what youre going to do
116220 im going to go back home i think ive outstayed my welcome its time i got back to normal besides youre off to scotland in a couple of days i believe
116221 no i need to sort myself out and im going to keep my mouth shut about dima if amber finds out it wont be from me they make a cute couple and i dont want to spoil that
116222 and marat and emma will you say anything to them about dima
116223 whats to say there isnt anything i just made it up dima and emma are best friends and should stay that way as for marat and emma well they are absolutely made for each other no question no way i want to spoil that
116224 i think i was just fooling myself that there was anything i could do
116225 i do believe the good jen is there after all i thought shed got lost but maybe it was just temporary you really mean it youre not going to cause trouble
116226 i mean it i really do so nobody need get hurt after all
116227 i better get going it took longer than i thought and em will wonder where i got to
116228 marat you are crazy suppose one of your friends saw us leave together do you realise how that looks if youve been all secretive
116229 itll be fine i told her id make it up to her later
116230 i dont think i even want to guess what you have in mind you have a very naughty look in your eyes
116231 tonight is going to be very special i hope she likes her surprise
116232 im sure she will alejandro is very good at his job she will love it now go before she sends out a search party you crazy gorgeous man
116233 i was with a friend why were you looking for me
116234 no tommy says she got a cancellation seat her plane just took off
116235 this is not the end of the story if the value of pensions is to be protected the retirement age will have to rise again
116236 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
116237 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
116238 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
116239 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
116240 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
116241 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
116242 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack

116258 can you tell me another story before i sleep please
116259 last time you read to me you finished your story about how hakuro and lin argued at their high school prom you said youll finish the story when you come back
116260 they cared about each other but they were too stubborn to apologize
116261 well they were at graduation and hakuro was being his usual self again
116262 the last days in cougar high and im proud to spend it with all of you
116263 let me say something i dont care where we are all going next year whether it be to stanford to njit or to princeton none of us better be strangers you hear
116264 or else the rza will come and get all of ya
116265 this summer were doing it right we are going to do anything and everything before we all go those separate ways
116266 i honestly wished i wasnt so stupid maybe i could have been with someone else
116267 if you have been with someone else you wouldnt be you
116268 i mean she has a boyfriend and im so stupid did you hear what happened at prom
116269 i wish i could tell you something to cheer you up but here she is right now
116270 you know seeing the sights living a little ive been spending so much time with people that i forget about others
116271 i dont get it why doesnt he talk to me anymore he doesnt even look me in the eye
116272 he makes me cry more than anyone has done before and he does that stupid laugh whenever he feel guilty or sad
116273 he loves you more than anything i guess it was kind of your fault for that he was tired of playing second string you know
116274 its nothing im sorry the story didnt have a better ending
116275 its okay mommy i loved the story and i guess it was the best ending i could ask for
116276 i dont know why but after all they went through and all the time they spent with each other they were strong enough to go their separate ways
116277 it was my mistake i got this story confused with something else
116278 in the end lin was able to break through the crowds and tell hakuro the truth and they lived happily ever after
116279 it was nice to know where you got my name from mommy
116280 i hate you so much hakuro you didnt even say goodbye to me

116292 for little kids i just say that volleyball is the ultimate team sport

116294 he really trains us hard every single day and gives us that confidence that when we go out on the court we know that we have trained for 24 hours a day and have confidence in his techniques and skills
116295 he took me over to the other court and said were going to do 1 000 of those balls ten sets of 100 after the first set of 100 my legs started to leave me and at 600 i couldnt really carry my body anymore or feel my legs i got to 1 000 and i dont think i have messed up a free ball in five or six years

116306 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

116314 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
116315 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
116316 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet

116354 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
116355 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
116356 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
116357 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
116358 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
116359 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that
116360 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
116361 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming
116362 were never closed to looking at how canadians can be more secure but we also want to look at the risk
116363 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end
116364 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
116365 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
116366 weve been overwhelmed sometimes half the crowd stays to share how they are living their lives simply with love and against empire
116367 its not about seeing a christian become the leader of the american empire jesus dropped the option for such a thing as christian emperor a true christian president would begin melting down our guns and closing our military bases
116368 but how are we political change doesnt happen just one day every four years we are not waiting for politicians to change the world gandhi who studied jesus put it this way be the change you want to be in the world the way we live our lives is our politics
116369 we are seeing more and more that the church has fallen in love with the state and that this love affair is killing the churchs imagination
116370 the powerful benefits and temptations of running the worlds largest superpower have bent the churchs identity too often the patriotic values of pride and strength triumph over the spiritual values of humility gentleness and sacrificial love
116371 i want to say im sorry sorry for the things many of us have done in the name of god things that are a contradiction of jesus teachings as gandhi said i love this jesus i wish christians would be more like him the beautiful thing for me is that jesus has survived all the things we have done to him maybe thats proof this thing is a lot bigger than us
116372 early christians were considered atheists because they had lost faith in the gods of empire
116373 i guess that gives us a lot in common with people who think of themselves as atheists we too have lost faith in the gods of empire
116374 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
116375 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up

116387 and did you get what you wanted from this life even so i did and what did you want to call myself beloved to feel myself beloved on the earth
116388 i stacked the car with everything that was not pinned down loading it with husband and two children warm bedding it gets surprisingly cold up the mountains at night mosquito spray an occasional table water container and a change of clothes each the dog and the kitchen sink stayed behind there was no space
116389 the kids loved it they played in the woods cooked marshmallows on a campfire and even went to bed grubby
116390 but i have heard differing reports apparently the best site is in limassol at governors beach and then i have heard good reports about the site in yeroskipou in paphos
116391 the campsite in polis has had mixed reactions my advice to anyone wanting to go camping is to go and visit the site first before you decided to stay there this way you wont be disappointed
116392 i have been to other campsites but my favourite is the one in polis
116393 its great to have a barbeque and really fun to sit around the campfire roasting marshmallows
116394 polis is nice because you are in the forest and the beach is literally just there i went fishing with my friend and the facilities are really good there are showers and clean toilets
116395 when we were there a greek band was playing the campers were cypriots and tourists all together and we all had a good time i really recommend it and want to go again
116396 due to a lack of rainfall the ground is like tinder and will set alight in moments while people should enjoy being outdoors they must think about their actions
116397 cigarettes must be properly extinguished and fires must not be lit unless they are in permitted areas built for this purpose
116398 in general i advise campers to act cautiously and avoid any actions which may facilitate a fire
116399 i have camped in the greek islands which were beautiful and i have to say better than cyprus not because of the surroundings but they have much better facilities and they are more organised than us
116400 i was camping in polis a week ago for a couple of days with some friends
116401 i really like it its on the beach and the tents are among eucalyptus trees so the shade is good its a nice place to get away from the every day routine but be wary of weekends it gets very busy and in august the place is packed and noisy
116402 its very clean and the showers were attended to about every half an hour but its a bit old the shower block should be pulled down and a more modern one built i would say its a great place for men but not so good for women apparently its a bit of a problem for women that there isnt any hot water one of my female friends said it isnt girl friendly
116403 i have visited all of the sites in cyprus and i really love pitching my tent in the troodos
116404 the climate up there is wonderful and its amazing to feel so at one with your surroundings i admit i have hugged a few of the trees
116405 for me the troodos mountain range is one of the most spectacular sights of the mediterranean it is very peaceful its a good place to go to recharge your batteries
116406 the site is to the left of the beach and is more organised and less noisy than polis
116407 i think some of the caravans may be permanent though as they are equipped with everything you could want including satellite television
116408 the water is shallow so its suitable for kids and there are some rock formations which are good if you want to explore or snorkel

116533 for the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
116534 this provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process
116535 one of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient poor environment
116536 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
116537 for this reason if more carbon is added to the soil in the form of plant residues the microbes would then just pump out more carbon in response

116576 what they found lacking was the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way more so on public places than in closed door meetings they did not find the will and the capacity in the prime minister to grasp the importance of issues take control of matters and make decisions which he could sustain
116577 the one issue which damaged gilanis credibility as a potentially serious leader and policy maker was the brutally botched up isi fiasco whoever did this to gilani actually torpedoed his us visit which turned into a non starter the moment the isi notification was withdrawn it was beyond gilani to stand by his order for more than a few hours and washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
116578 but the moment the script was over and he had to answer questions the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth the contrast was so stark and embarrassing it discounted both the images gilani presented and made him look like artificial and someone who was being remote controlled
116579 washington was not ready for such a visit and whoever forced it on gilani did a great disservice to the man to the party he represents and to pakistans infant democracy at a time of great internal political administrative security economic and social turmoil packing him off to washington as a showpiece so early in office could at best be described as a deep conspiracy of sorts his insincere advisers more interested in their own self projection pushed him to fly across the atlantic for performing the impossible task of exposing himself to the most sophisticated important and hawk eyed audience of decision makers to be found anywhere in the world

116801 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
116802 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
116803 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
116804 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
116805 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
116806 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
116807 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
116808 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
116809 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
116810 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
116811 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
116812 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
116813 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
116814 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
116815 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
116816 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
116817 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
116818 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
116819 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
116820 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
116821 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
116822 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
116823 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
116824 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
116825 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
116826 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
116827 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
116828 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

116846 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
116847 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
116848 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
116849 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
116850 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
116851 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
116852 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
116853 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
116854 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
116855 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
116856 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
116857 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
116858 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
116859 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
116860 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

116886 hello to everyone enrolled in painting techniques youll be pleased to hear that angela in cairns and i are waiting patiently for the beginning on the first class so that we may get the subject underway and onto some good times i think you are in for a steep learning curve and an enjoyable experience all at the same time by now i suspect that you will have downloaded the subject outline and have looked at the program the first week should be lots of fun as the topic is grinding pigments and making paint to ensure that time is used effectively i suggest that you collect a handful or two of small pebbles that you imagine will be easy to smash with a hammer and later grind to powder pigment i advise that you should avoid very hard rocks like granite or glass like ones like quartz feldspar and agate as the powder is not useful for our purposes if you forget to bring some rocks no worries as there will be plenty outside the room but mmm they will be boring to use for grinding the pigment townsville has a selection of mortar and pestles available and with all fingers crossed so will cairns nevertheless if you have your own mortar and pestle to bring to class particularly for those in cairns all the better townsville and again with fingers crossed cairns has eye protection safety goggles for the rock smashing activities but they are very very ugly and if you have your own please bring them for that touch of glamour i know that both campuses have a good supply of dust masks and gloves so there is no need to bring your own two last requests please bring some small bottles containers to store your pigment and some material to wrap around the rocks during smashing so that dust and rock fragments are contained in your first week angela and i will be going through the week to week exercises and during this chat we can attend to any concerns you may have until the first class dont worry too much just come to the workshop with a smile and be prepared to help make the class truly memorable

117026 bagi kalangan pelajar mereka butuh ukuran yang kecil yang bisa muat ke dalam tas tanpa membebani barang bawaannya sehari hari kalangan pelajar ini juga tidak banyak membutuhkan aplikasi untuk notebook mini mereka biasanya hanya menggunakan aplikasi windows office dan game saja utamanya mereka memanfaatkan notebook mini sebagai bank data
117027 di perumahan dirgantara permai ini kan kebanyakan penghuninya purnawirawan semua bahkan ada beberapa warga yang berprofesi sebagai pengacara juga menolak pembangunan spbu tersebut

117046 the prosecution is sending a warning that while some things might be tolerated in sports other actions wont be tolerated
117047 im getting ready for next season and if i have to testify ill go testify
117048 there is no reasonable prospect of conviction and the police investigation is continuing
117049 this has been a terrible ordeal for myself and my family i want to thank my family for all their support under very stressful conditions i am very glad this has come to an end
117050 its clear that she was an important reason why they decided to lay charges and shes an important reason why they chose to drop them
117051 they hold this huge press conference and it poisons the publics mind against the person announcing that the case has been solved the problem is of course its a situation where the accused is being tried in the court of public opinion
117052 my heart goes out to the other family especially to beverly smiths daughter but its been very hard for alans children too this all supposedly happened before they were born
117053 i dont think any of us have been able to get a full nights sleep since it happened
117054 the crown attorney made a difficult decision to drop the charges they decided that there was not a reasonable prospect of a conviction however the investigation is continuing and the homicide team remains positive that it will come to a positive conclusion
117055 if it is the drug of choice its not available in toronto
117056 its not available like it has been in the past
117057 it was all 100 bills more than id ever seen
117058 we exited the bus everybody got off the bus but a few of us me and the trucker and one of the greyhound drivers went back on the bus to go see what was going on and thats when we saw he had the guy on the ground he was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
117059 that trucker he had a crowbar and we ran and got a hammer and stuff me and the other bus driver there tried to guard the door put our bodies up against the door and you know waiting for him to come out and whatnot
117060 and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much you know displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us very calmly all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses and like you know it was no big deal to him
117061 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying
117062 i dont think it will leave me for a while
117063 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
117064 he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much you know displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
117065 very calmly all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses and like you know it was no big deal to him
117066 we do random wanding at our terminals in the u s but we dont have that procedure in canada
117067 i feel there is a groundswell of anger with cellphone companies
117068 we dont have a heavy regulatory burden on the cellular industry thats something that we have tried to maintain in canada at the end of the day consumers do need to be protected
117069 evolved into a market where canadian consumers feel they have absolutely no protection
117070 carriers can act with impunity and do whatever they want without fear of the government stepping in to rein them in
117071 the introduction of the 15 cent charge for incoming text messages represents the height of arrogance on the part of bell and telus
117072 they fail to recognize that actions like this erode any loyalty customers might have had
117073 he was absolutely innocent simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
117074 hes just a decent guy up here to do a job and make a living
117075 were the last stop on the underground railway were just a normal little tourist town a hockey town every town wants a great reputation and we do we dont want this kind of thing happening but every town small or large has people who will cause problems
117076 i saw about five guys beating on a black guy with a 2 by 4
117077 they had him right up against a van beating the crap right out of him
117078 he was quite upset and affronted by the whole thing he asked if a rapist was at large in the community we sent an officer down there to try and sort it out
117079 it wasnt who he was but he fit a description of a man
117080 it wasnt theres a black guy lets go get him in the middle of the assault hes on his cellphone trying to call us hes innocent in all ways
117081 its a safe city of really decent hard working people who hate this stain on their community
117082 yes the number of foreclosures is still huge compared to the amount of help that is available i remain optimistic that this can help a significant number of people
117083 they are doing something illegal or transmitting something illegal based on chinese laws
117084 for instance they are propagating this evil cult falun gong
117085 important questions about obamas judgment consistency and honesty are not being asked let alone answered
117086 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
117087 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
117088 i want to go out on a limb and say that my dark horse for fourth spot is great britain
117089 their goal for 2012 is top four theyre going to achieve that here
117090 they are the ones truly on the rise similar to china
117091 for the same reasons that china is coming and emerging after getting the 2008 games great britain are creating a great programme and putting enormous resources from the sport lottery into their programme
117092 i fully accept that beijing will be judged as a stand alone games
117093 but for us in the boa theres a much greater goal here and thats making sure we deliver in london in 2012 when the entire nation will be looking and expecting of us

117118 matthews one of those guys that plays in many positions hes played on glass a lot over many years that may happen again
117119 it will be intriguing the match ups and who goes through the midfield on sunday
117120 shaun would just like the guys to play the way he does
117121 i hope the games spirited confrontational at times and its last man standing thats what i hope and thats what ill talk to them about
117122 well acknowledge shaun after the game in the best possible way we can
117123 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
117124 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
117125 its fortuitous that this diagnostic test could be applied to horse flu as its highly unlikely that a similar test could have been developed in a timely manner once the outbreak had been detected
117126 the use of the test supported the decision to try for eventual eradication
117127 and at a much reduced expense to the industry and freeing up horse movements

117134 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
117135 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
117136 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
117137 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
117138 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
117139 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
117140 it has been a dream of mine ever since i was a little girl
117141 one of the things im really looking forward to is the opening ceremony and walking with athletes from my country in front of thousands of people
117142 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
117143 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
117144 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
117145 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso
117146 the flip side of that is he cannot turn down the offer to take the position
117147 reforms that put a stress on consumers and ordinary people as well as the importance of revitalising the economy
117148 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
117149 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
117150 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
117151 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
117152 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties
117153 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
117154 hes 100 1 to play for australia and it would be a wonderful experience
117155 because of that case were very twitchy on making sure we are squeaky clean
117156 we need birth certificates passports or other documents stamped by a registrar as proof
117157 they play in the domestic competition and not for les catalans and when they have to play international competition theyre too far off the pace
117158 the jump from club rugby league to international rugby league is just too big for them
117159 theyre good for 40 or 50 minutes and this eight weeks will be very good for them

117181 this is too warm to be the antarctic water we know today
117182 and the sea water chemistry shows there was little or no ice on the planet
117183 because the fossils are so well preserved they provide more accurate temperature records
117184 our findings demonstrate that the water temperature these creatures lived in was much warmer than previous records have shown
117185 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
117186 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
117187 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
117188 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
117189 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
117190 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
117191 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
117192 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
117193 its important because it tells us there is a risk in using just one model its quite true that you should have different approaches and methods it just makes the results more robust
117194 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
117195 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
117196 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
117197 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
117198 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
117199 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
117200 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
117201 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you dont need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
117202 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that its not unnatural to have it in the mechanism
117203 i thought id be answering phone calls from creditors and writing order forms out by hand now that we see the potential of the middle east e gaming development consumer market weve immediately hired new staff to meet the high demands of this market
117204 starting up a new middle east e gaming development company
117205 youll need lots of capital talent luck and financial discipline to see your project through
117206 ive always wanted to start my own middle east e gaming development company through the internet
117207 and now i can because of new government grants for internet start ups
117208 we got start up capital from family friends and a few bank loans
117209 and then slowly paid each respective party off one at a time this took about five years to do but all debts were satisfied with full repayment and some extra for interest
117210 because many see them as rough investment forecasts or as prospectuses for local companies as a result there is a big scramble to get this info and buy into local middle east e gaming development businesses right away before market prices exceed a reasonable investment amount
117211 but i must say it is easy creating a new corporate community and economic boom that will benefit those around us greatly many times start up companies tend to become burdens to the general public beacuse they fold or otherwise go under but companies like mine mitigate that risk and show profits right away this means less foreclosures and higher credit limits for businesspeople like me who are looking to the future of the middle east e gaming development industry

117240 i and a bipartisan majority of members in the house are promoting what we call the all of the above energy strategy it includes expanding domestic and deep ocean drilling increasing production of american energy increasing our investment into alternative fuels and promoting conservation and it deserves an honest up or down vote in congress so far democratic leaders have refused to allow such a vote
117241 put carl mumpower up for election id love to see the democratic landslide that results
117242 that sort of reflects the political realities of henderson county
117243 of course we were in the correct assumption the manual was not the same as the law he sounded like he was so shocked i said right from the start i supported development organized development
117244 i have friends in various areas that want to be supportive
117245 i do have an established network i think that is one of my strengths
117246 the effect of the national economy is being felt in all of north carolinas 100 counties
117247 while the number of counties that had increasing rates is fewer than the previous month we see that the rising price of gasoline is having an impact on the labor force while our commission offices still receive job orders from employers the pace has dropped even during the busy summer months it appears employers have reduced hiring making it a much tighter job market
117248 i believe were seeing the same patterns locally that the national economy is seeing
117249 i think the gas prices are having an impact on a variety of businesses the gas prices are a factor that is impacting the tourism market because people just arent traveling this summer they way they normally do we are seeing a decline in the construction industry were seeing people laid off from that industry for the first time in years and we have also seen an impact in the real estate industry there have been some layoffs from the real estate industry in our area in recent months and thats caused primarily by the mortgage crisis
117250 on a positive note manufacturing seems to be holding its own and there are even job openings in manufacturing in the western north carolina area
117251 thats interesting because the last recession we had was mainly a manufacturing recession so its good to see manufacturing had held up better than most of the other sectors of the economy so far

117253 our position is we only supply uranium to a country which is a party to the nuclear non proliferation treaty india is not such a party
117254 weve made that clear to the indian government from day one
117255 but what this arrangement does is it puts for the future a substantial proportion of indias civil nuclear industry under the authority of the international regulator the international atomic energy agency and we support that
117256 our approach is that the nuclear suppliers group of course has got a different decision to make
117257 we will apply the same approach in principle terms to that decision as we have to this one we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind

117435 do you personally support revival of the fairness doctrine i asked
117436 david shipley the times op ed editor sent an e mail to mccains staff rejecting the piece and offering suggestions on how to tailor it for resubmission
117437 it is not conservatives who having lost in the talk radio marketplace of ideas are pushing to reinstitute the fairness doctrine to suppress political viewpoints they find objectionable and it is not conservative newspaper editors who masquerading as objective high minded journalists exhibit the stunning audacity to refuse publication of an op ed by the presidential candidate they oppose after having published one from the one they endorse
117438 the left supports campaign finance reform the fairness doctrine and other policies allegedly aimed at ensuring that both sides of the political argument be aired but its a colossal fraud
117439 can you imagine what would be in store for political speech in this country if liberals resumed regulatory control of the airways
117440 i can and am horrified at the prospect and you should be too
117441 our massive strategy was to use the fairness doctrine to challenge and harass right wing broadcasters and hope the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue
117442 they said weve got to do something about this these are nothing but far right wing extremists theres got to be a legislative fix for this
117443 a year ago sean hannity was squawking about a direct assault on the first amendment via what he feared was an attempt to reinstate the fairness doctrine now its free market be damned as he keeps whining that john mccain is not getting the same amount of press coverage as barack obama fox news democratic newcomer howard wolfson did an excellent job of arguing that republicans should quit bellyaching
117444 its time to reinstitute the fairness doctrine i have this old fashioned attitude that when americans hear both sides of the story theyre in a better position to make a decision
117445 i believe very strongly that the airwaves are public and people use these airwaves for profit but there is a responsibility to see that both sides and not just one side of the big public questions of debate of the day are aired and are aired with some modicum of fairness
117446 i think the fairness doctrine ought to be there and i also think equal time doctrine ought to come back these are the people that wiped out one of the most profound changes in the balance of the media is when the conservatives got rid of the equal time requirements and the result is that they have been able to squeeze down and squeeze out opinion of opposing views and i think its been a very important transition in the imbalance of our public eye
117447 an analysis of federal records shows that the amount of money journalists contributed so far this election cycle favors democrats by a 15 1 ratio over republicans with 225 563 going to democrats only 16 298 to republicans
117448 two hundred thirty five journalists donated to democrats just 20 gave to republicans a margin greater than 10 to 1 an even greater disparity 20 to 1 exists between the number of journalists who donated to barack obama and john mccain
117449 49 of voters believe most reporters will try to help the democrats with their coverage up from 44 a month ago

117457 yeah you can certainly do confusing things even with gnome
117458 the church of rome is fearful that it could lose more priests like us
117459 and it should be afraid given its level of scandal over internal abuses and hypocrisy in combating poverty
117460 what they want to do is put an end to the catholic church but they have not succeeded
117461 they get dressed up as priests conduct baptisms and confirmations all paid for by the government while the people go hungry
117462 i share the revolutionary project of president ch vez since it is a socialist and humanist project for the masses
117463 ch vez is carrying out the work of god and i hope our priests here do the same
117464 the old catholic church claims to work on behalf of the needy but what have they done for us in all these centuries
117465 this is yet another poke in the eye to the venezuelan catholic church
117466 the roman catholic authorities decided the best way to belittle them is to claim some sort of link to ch vez
117467 but we are not homophobes since our services are open to anyone
117468 a kind of chicken soup a tossed salad something that will not have any internal coherence
117469 but we just happen to share many of the same ideas as our president
117470 id say that 50 percent of catholic priests in venezuela secretly have wives
117471 it is our quest to free the poor from the yoke of others while having a fulfilling life of our own
117472 we dont wish the families of enemy soldiers to experience what americans had to go through in the aftermath of the vietnam war
117473 woe to those who call evil good and good evil who put darkness for light
117474 and now will these americans children planted by our care nourished up by our indulgence until they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence and protected by our arms will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from heavy weight of the burden which we lie under
117475 they planted by your care no your oppression planted em in america they fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and inhospitable country where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable and among others to the cruelties of a savage foe the most subtle and i take upon me to say the most formidable of any people upon the face of gods earth they nourished by your indulgence they grew by your neglect of em as soon as you began to care about em that care was exercised in sending persons to rule over em in one department and another who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some member of this house sent to spy out their liberty to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon em men whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within them they protected by your arms they have nobly taken up arms in your defence have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier while drenched in blood its interior parts have yielded all its little savings to your emolument the people i believe are as truly loyal as any subjects the king has but a people jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated but the subject is too delicate and i will say no more
117476 whatever we once were were no longer a christian nation at least not just we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation and a buddhist nation and a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
117477 somehow somewhere along the way faith stopped being used to bring us together and started being used to drive us apart it got hijacked part of its because of the so called leaders of the christian right whove been all too eager to exploit what divides us
117478 i cannot swallow whole the view of lincoln as the great emancipator
117479 ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
117480 its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
117481 my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success
117482 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok thats not leadership
117483 we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
117484 what i value most about pastor wright is not his day to day political advice hes much more of a sounding board for me to make sure that i am speaking as truthfully about what i believe as possible and that im not losing myself in some of the hype and hoopla and stress thats involved in national politics
117485 you know my faith is one that admits some doubt
117486 dont want to pit red america against blue america i want to be president of the united states of america
117487 this notion thats peddled by the religious right that they are oppressed is not true sometimes its a cynical ploy to move their agenda ahead the classic example being that somehow secularists are trying to eliminate christmas which strikes me as some kind of manufactured controversy
117488 you know theres a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit but i think we should talk more about our empathy deficit the ability to put ourselves in someone elses shoes to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from us the child whos hungry the steelworker whos been laid off the family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town when you think like this when you choose to broaden your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others whether they are close friends or distant strangers it becomes harder not to act harder not to help
117489 when we send our young men and women into harms way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going to care for their families while theyre gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war secure the peace and earn the respect of the world
117490 weve come to be consumed by a 24 hour slash and burn negative ad bickering small minded politics that doesnt move us forward sometimes one side is up and the other side is down but theres no sense that they are coming together in a common sense practical nonideological way to solve the problems that we face
117491 our goal is to have a country thats not divided by race and my impression as i travel around the country is that thats the kind of country that most people want as well and that we all have prejudice we all have certain suspicions or stereotypes about people who are different from us whether its religious or racial or ethnic but what i think i found in the american people i think theres a core decency there where if they take the time if they get the time to know individuals then they want to judge those individuals by their character
117492 i am convinced that whenever we exaggerate or demonize oversimplify or overstate our case we lose
117493 the internet today is an open platform where the demand for websites and services dictates success youve got barriers to entry that are low and equal for all comers and its because the internet is a neutral platform that i can put on this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through some corporate media middleman i can say what i want without censorship i dont have to pay a special charge but the big telephone and cable companies want to change the internet as we know it they say they want to create high speed lanes on the internet and strike exclusive contractual arrangements with internet content providers for access to those high speed lanes those of us who cant pony up the cash for these high speed connections will be relegated to the slow lanes we cant have a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and thats why im supporting what is called net neutrality
117494 well thats not nice you know actually people come and listen to daddy speak
117495 its not just enough to change the players weve gotta change the game
117496 on may 12 1948 clark clifford the white house chief counsel presented the case for u
117497 behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them
117498 i really wish the jews again in judea an independent nation
117499 1816 niles weekly register the leading american news and opinion periodical through much of the first half of the nineteenth century predicted and welcomed the impending return of the jews to an independent state with jerusalem as its capital
117500 books and pamphlets highlighting the predicted restoration of the jews and speculating on the identity and the return of the
117501 in 1891 these strands of gentile zionists came together the methodist lay leader william blackstone presented a petition to president benjamin harrison calling on the united states to use its good offices to convene a congress of european powers so that they could induce the ottoman empire to turn palestine over to the jews the 400 signatories were overwhelmingly non jewish and included the chief justice of the supreme court the speaker of the house of representatives the chairs of the house ways and means committee and the house foreign affairs committee the future president william mckinley the mayors of baltimore boston chicago new york philadelphia and washington the editors or proprietors of the leading east coast and chicago newspapers and an impressive array of episcopal methodist presbyterian and roman catholic clergy business leaders who signed the petition included cyrus mccormick john rockefeller and j p morgan at a time when the american jewish community was neither large nor powerful and no such thing as an israel lobby existed the pillars of the american gentile establishment went on record supporting a u s diplomatic effort to create a jewish state in the lands of the bible
117502 instruction in biblical hebrew was mandatory for much of early u
117503 the most dramatic religious expression of the importance of the old testament in american culture today is the rise of premillennial dispensationalism an interpretation of biblical prophecies that gives particular weight to old testament religious concepts such as covenant theology and assigns a decisive role to a restored jewish state with jerusalem as its capital in future history an estimated seven percent of americans seem to hold this theological position making this group almost four times as large as the american jewish community and a considerably larger group is influenced by it to a greater or lesser degree proponents of this view often although not always share the view of some orthodox jews that the jews must insist on a state that includes all the territory once promised to the hebrews they oppose any territorial compromise with the palestinians and support jewish settlements in the west bank
117504 jacksonians believe that only overwhelming and total retaliation against such tactics can deter the attackers from striking again
117505 by 1948 many christians in the united states felt a heavy burden of historical debt and obligation toward the jews but not the muslims if anything they believed that the islamic world was indebted to american christian missionaries for many of its leading universities and hospitals and that american christian support before and after world war ii had helped promote the emergence of independent arab and muslim states that was then taking place
117506 from the time of the puritans to the present day preachers thinkers and politicians in the united states secular as well as religious liberal as well as conservative have seen the americans as a chosen people
117507 it seems to me entirely proper to start a zionist state around jerusalem
117508 people able to settle the wilderness and make it bloom
117509 as the mainstream churches became more critical of traditional american ideas about the united states national identity and destiny they distanced themselves ever further from traditional readings of the old testament
117510 but by any real consideration it is prostitution and climbing into bed with the enemy
117511 the israeli settlements in the west bank east jerusalem and the golan heights

117519 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
117520 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
117521 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
117522 those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
117523 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
117524 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
117525 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
117526 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
117527 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
117528 people age 65 and older should still get yearly flu vaccines as usual

117629 only the best and most dedicated can cut it here as a manager sewing machine operatives need firm treatment and clear management if targets are to be met in the clothing manufacturing business there is no room for sentiment workers have to shape up or ship out
117630 whats the point of killing yourself to meet unrealistic targets even if you do manage to meet the bonus target management is straight down here cutting the time allowances and they even have the cheek to complain if there are slight defects on the garments what do they expect when we are asked to work with poor materials cheap thread and useless sewing machines the machine i have to operate is worse than the one i have at home whenever i mention these things to the supervisor she tells me to stop complaining and that it is our job to make do with the materials provided i wouldnt care but it is obvious from the way management is always chasing around that they cannot even control the batches of orders in the system if they could our lives would be a lot easier we could get on and reach production targets instead of constantly chopping and changing the batches to let through the rush orders it seems to me that all of the orders are or eventually become rush orders if you ask me it is their inability to organize things that causes all of the problems if its not that it is the sleeping in section making so many mistakes that makes our job twice as hard i dont suppose that you can blame them though they are just trying to make their bonus too
117631 i am not sure that i was wise to accept promotion to this job it is a thankless task we are constantly being harangued by senior management to achieve higher production and at the same time they are always coming down into the production areas and interfering with the schedules they think nothing about altering our work schedules at a moments notice to push through late orders or special deliveries if you complain you are told that you have to be flexible and that the customer is king the worst part is having to deal with the staff i didnt realize how awkward and how militant they could be until i got this job perhaps it was jealousy that i got promoted they certainly dont like any social contact now that i am on the other side so to speak not that it bothers me too much i knew when i took the job that i would have to be quite tough with them it goes with the territory i suppose i guess that i was promoted because i am a little bit more intelligent than the average production worker they dont have to think too much do they all of the key decisions are taken by us because we have the experience and the brains and the motivation to get things done they seem to be happier when things are going wrong so that they are held up cant they understand that their jobs depend upon us being profitable
117632 as far as i am concerned it is quite simple staff come to work and receive a fair days pay i expect a fair days work in return they do not have to like it as long as they perform their duties good heavens i dont always enjoy the work and the pressure of this job but i know that it has to be done so i get on with it that is why they pay me it is not complicated and it does not require us to win their hearts and minds as to the gripes and groans you have heard i am sorry but we have to be flexible if everyone works hard and is prepared to be flexible about the machines the orders and the materials the whole job will go smoothly that is what i do and i expect no less from my staff

117649 women serving in our armed forces who come forward and report a sexual assault must be protected from their alleged attackers
117650 dods record of protecting women who report a rape and prosecute their case is shocking and unacceptable i believe the legislation that congresswoman harman and i have put forward is a critical step in helping to solve this problem
117651 the resolution introduced today by congresswoman harman focuses on a crucial issue that must be addressed sadly the number of reported sexual assaults and rapes in the military has increased dramatically and continues to rise yet the number of cases that are not prosecuted has reached alarming levels while the military has made some attempt to investigate these cases it is not doing nearly enough
117652 in this resolution congresswoman harman who has long been seen as a leader on issues affecting women in the military lays out concrete steps for what needs to be done we urge the house of representatives to pass it without delay

117675 its truly amazing how much talent we had here this summer
117676 this was a great chance for all the students to feed off each other
117677 some of the works they produced this summer they never would have been able to accomplish in the classroom
117678 but over the summer they were able to build a foundation elaborate on it and connect the two in a meaningful way
117679 it puts them in an environment where they dont have to memorize anything for a test they can have fun

117687 abh ngig von den individuellen k rpereigenschaften und den pers nlichen w nschen und erwartungen sind unterschiedliche techniken zu empfehlen
117688 dar ber hinaus kursieren in den medien berichte ber behandlungen zur brustvergr erung mit hyalurons ure zu deren langzeitwirkung es noch keine gesicherten studien gibt
117689 die brustvergr erung mit eigenfett ist sehr k rperfreundlich da hier mit k rpereigenem gewebe gearbeitet wird l sen die zellen keine abwehrreaktionen aus
117690 die patienten k nnen bei dieser methode eine vergr erung um bis zu einen cup erreichen
117691 problematisch ist dass zu dieser behandlungsart noch keine empirischen langzeitstudien vorliegen und man daher nicht mit sicherheit sagen kann ob der synthetische stoff macrolane im brustdr sengewebe zu zysten oder granulombildung f hrt au erdem kann eine entsprechende fremdk rperreaktion die erkennung von brustkrebs erschweren

117714 today we build on the legacy of those who preceded us those pioneers at seneca falls as well as the women who blazed a path in the house today we stand up for working women and their families
117715 today the congress has sent a message to women across the country that their work is valued equal pay is an issue of fundamental fairness but as families grapple with difficult economic times equal pay for equal work is often about daily survival for millions of families
117716 women have shattered so many barriers in the 45 years since the equal pay act was enacted and for young women paving their way in the workforce today the sky is the limit but we still have work to do to truly level the playing field
117717 thats why i have championed the paycheck fairness act to build on the promise of the equal pay act and help close the pay gap
117718 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women its a shame that so many women still struggle to receive equal pay for equal work

117727 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
117728 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
117729 it is very refreshing for zimbabweans to hear the negotiators saying the process is going on very well especially when it comes from the opposition and it comes from morgan tsvangirai himself it is good to hear that but again it is too early for ordinary zimbabweans to celebrate because as you know that there is a media blackout and we dont know exactly what they are discussing and if they are saying they are proceeding very well we dont know what is well but with tsvangirai we would have to hope that they mean well for the people of zimbabwe
117730 i dont think that if tsvangirai is saying the talks are going very well and they mean that mugabe will remain the helm of government mugabe remains the state president i dont think i will describe that as well because as long as you have mugabe in the leadership in whatever position but still the head there is no well in the talks because i dont think that is what the zimbabweans want
117731 zimbabweans want a new set of leadership even if it is transitional i dont think they now need a name called mugabe
117732 that is a very good move by the opposition when the talks started we said we were very skeptical about mugabes intentions we believed that he was only asking the opposition and the opposition asking zanu pf to come up with its lists of demands and the proposal that came from zanu pf shows that mugabes intention was to swallow the opposition and surely we cannot be creating vice presidents anytime there is a crisis and when there are negotiations we solve that by creating vice presidents
117733 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom

117742 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
117743 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
117744 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
117745 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government

117753 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support

117755 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso

117758 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success
117759 this time horizon is a planning tool not a definitive schedule
117760 before it was a status of forces agreement presented as a long term agreement with some hope one day foreign troops will end their mandate
117761 now we are talking about when foreign forces are going to cease their operations

117766 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
117767 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
117768 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
117769 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution

117814 it is impossible to have political scientists in the absence of political participation
117815 the connection between democracy and political science has been a close and continuing one
117816 where democracy is strong political science is strong where democracy is weak political science is weak
117817 however bad a given evil may be a worse one is always possible and often likely witness the unhappy recent experiences of cuba vietnam cambodia the political scientist consequently can only be skeptical of a claim that as one chilean dissident ariel dorfman put it there is no way in which we are going to see anything worse than general pinochet or the argument of an opponent of apartheid that the first african government of south africa could scarcely be any worse than the current regime
117818 cultural differences relative numbers conflicting interests and divergent political objectives
117819 the liberal belief that each person deserves equal political and civic rights
117820 the congruence of that liberal principle with south african traditions and its relevance to south african needs seem to me to be questionable
117821 the abstract proposition that increased authoritarianism might actually be necessary for reform
117822 it is not inconceivable that narrowing the scope of political participation may be indispensable to eventually broadening that participation
117823 the centralization of power may also be necessary for the government to maintain the control over violence that is essential to carry through major reforms
117824 without considering the actual methods by which control over violence is maintained in south africa was to offer a form of unction to say man to man that we all know how difficult reform can be

117830 bad personnel decisions have haunted the bush administration and one of the bigger disappointments is federal communications commission chairman kevin martin in his last months as master of the media universe he seems poised to expand government regulation of the internet
117831 it appears to reverse a decade old bipartisan policy against regulation of the internet
117832 t he internet has flourished because it has operated under the principle that engineers not politicians or bureaucrats should solve engineering problems
117833 the fccs job is not to determine business models in the private sector the community of internet service and content providers has proven itself more than able to work out problems on its own as web use has exploded
117834 will incessantly petition the fcc to review each and every business model decision and encourage the unelected bureaucrats at the agency to manage the internet to their hearts content
117835 imagine if two completely separate things your bank statements and your calendar spoke the same language and could share information with one another you could drag one on top of the other and a whole bunch of dots would appear showing you when you spent your money
117836 we have worked on a lot of simplification reducing the clutter and we still need to reduce more twine has a lot of powerful features nobody uses so we are moving some of the advanced features out of the way
117837 the fall release will bring more intelligence and semantics to the surface for example we will let anyone define a new type of thing such as a recipe or baseball team form to author its more like what freebase does and we will also likely integrate with freebase over time
117838 a major focus of our work is on personalization and recommendations
117839 ultimately twine is about interest networking and is a content distribution network people declare their interests add content join twines and connect with people as users work with the system it learns about their interests using artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies to provide more relevance we are not attempting to index the whole web just the best stuff of interest to users ninety nine percent of whats on the web is not interesting to a user so its more about high signal to noise
117840 the goal for twine is to be the place on the web that best understands your interests and represents them to others the key is to give users control and privacy

117876 due to exaggerated and nonsensical claims about its linguistic status the whole notion of ulster scots culture has just become a case for ridicule for most people in northern ireland over the past few years
117877 in fact the scots tongue continues to be used daily by thousands of people across northern ireland and donegal and reflects a shared heritage a shared heritage with scotland and a shared heritage among people within the province of ulster regardless of their religious background
117878 therefore a paper from the ulster scots agency slamming misguided attempts to create a separate ulster scots language is a welcome and i hope significant contribution to stopping the nonsense and stopping the ridicule

118163 u s courts can guarantee little justice for a curious british hacker who now faces trial as a terrorist
118164 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
118165 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him

118168 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
118169 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
118170 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom

118177 climate change is the gathering storm of our generation and the implications should we fail to act could be no less dire and perhaps even more so
118178 the executive cannot be the judge of its own privilege and hence ms miers is not entitled to absolute immunity from compelled congressional process
118179 we are reviewing it and once we have had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
118180 it was a victory for all who believe in checks and balances it certainly strengthens our hand
118181 todays landmark ruling is a ringing reaffirmation of the fundamental principle of checks and balances and the basic american idea that no person is above the law
118182 the court strongly encourages the parties to reach a negotiated solution to this dispute
118183 this is historic because it is the first judicial opinion that squarely upholds a congressional subpoena against the white house
118184 one can easily imagine a stand off between the sergeant at arms and executive branch law enforcement officials concerning taking mr bolten into custody and detaining him
118185 we already knew the economy was weak and now you have both a negative growth number coupled with job losses
118186 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions and that the economy would shrink this quarter not grow
118187 clearly the tax rebates did give some oomph to the economy
118188 in an environment where the global economy is clearly slowing youre not being able to get that export growth in future quarters
118189 this reflects sheer panic by retailers about what the next christmas buying season is going to look like
118190 they slowed the downturn but its clear they didnt really provide any spark
118191 looking forward i dont think theres anything to change the lousy trend for the domestic economy
118192 on the one hand theyll say and then on the other hand if they had three hands it would be on the one hand the second hand and the third hand
118193 they have the luxury of not having ph d s the auto companies are in dire straits the airlines have been shutting down flights and firing pilots the truckers are in near hysteria because of the price of diesel if you round up the usual suspects this is a bad circumstance and the word we usually use for a bad circumstance is a recession

118199 empirische studien zeigen dass der gesetzgeber sich nicht au erhalb seines einsch tzungsspielraums bewegt wenn er davon ausgeht dass es bei inzestverbindungen zwischen geschwistern zu gravierenden familien und sozialsch digenden wirkungen kommen kann inzestverbindungen f hren zu einer berschneidung von verwandtschaftsverh ltnissen und sozialen rollenverteilungen und damit zu einer beeintr chtigung der in einer familie strukturgebenden zuordnungen solche rollen berschneidungen entsprechen nicht dem bild der familie das art 6 abs 1 gg zu grunde liegt

118203 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
118204 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
118205 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
118206 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
118207 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
118208 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
118209 the court has established that the accused nevzlin organised the committing of several especially serious crimes
118210 just shareholders are clearly demonstrating their support of the premier offer and recognise that accepting the offer and benefiting from substantial cash and scrip components is better than risking the offer lapsing and being left with just shares at a likely lower share price

118212 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
118213 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
118214 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
118215 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

118243 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
118244 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
118245 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
118246 the trial aims to recruit 56 000 people across the uk treat any who show signs of h pylori infection and follow them over 15 to 20 years to see if this treatment is effective
118247 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
118248 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill
118249 almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise for these people if there was a way to mimic exercise it would make the quality of exercise they do more efficient
118250 in korea it used to be the tradition for children to look after their parents
118251 but society has changed and i want my children to be free of this burden so i need to live as long as possible
118252 but the korean family structure is becoming more nuclear women are pursuing their own careers and people are no longer able to look after their elderly relatives
118253 the type of care that used to be done by individual families is having to be taken over by the state
118254 the increase in insurance payments will mean the burden on individuals will decrease and those who were trapped into having to care for relatives will be free to work
118255 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
118256 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
118257 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
118258 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
118259 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
118260 no you stay ill go and pick up some bread

118275 at the end of the day there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that
118276 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
118277 the fact that it melted at zero degrees centigrade leaves very little doubt
118278 its a little bit like a free lunch without the calories
118279 the fact you can mimic exercise is a big advantage because diet and exercise are the pillars of diabetes treatment
118280 it is possible that the couch potato segment of the population might find this to be a good regimen and of course that is a large number of people
118281 it is consistent with our strategy to focus on specialty areas of high unmet need
118282 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
118283 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
118284 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
118285 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
118286 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
118287 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
118288 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
118289 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
118290 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
118291 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
118292 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
118293 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
118294 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
118295 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
118296 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
118297 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
118298 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
118299 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
118300 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this
118301 but the dynamic is different this year because of the presidential election
118302 we dont want to get swallowed up in the issues between the two parties
118303 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families

118308 its not like our players are not going to get through waivers
118309 well decide on friday beginning with fridays series who we want to play and when
118310 our veterans have been great about what our needs have been i dont expect that to change theyre not going to be an impediment they all have a good relationship with the ballclub and the manager and myself and the front office they understand the program theres not any problem with the path were following
118311 obviously ill have to to take pressure off bruce bochy and make sure everybody is on the same page
118312 it was a nice thought yeah we were hoping but early on i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt take the last couple days to figure it out players like that havent been moved so that will tell you what the climate was like
118313 we did all the work and there was no interest
118314 were confident this is an ongoing process now well see who gets through waivers and hope people come to their senses
118315 the day has come and gone but its not an impediment in my mind to what we need to do
118316 i started learning magic tricks and it gave me a skill that was unique
118317 magic is a beautiful artform it really is the secrets and the tricks are hundreds of years old whats new and really worthy of success is the presentation you bring to it
118318 more people could enjoy it and thats what im trying to do i want to tour the world with my own branch of art
118319 it really is a full production with a mix of different elements
118320 there are sections that are slow and sections that are dramatic i would like to keep bringing bigger more baffling effects and more dangerous effects
118321 people come up to me after shows to get my autograph and take photos
118322 they write me emails and sometimes they come to the show with posters and banners its really cool
118323 i just love performing in front of an audience its hard to explain the buzz you get when the audience really loves what you do as much as you do its made me who i am
118324 we expect the stimulus to continue to support the economy in the second half of the year
118325 solyndras panels are highly innovative and offer unique design features that differentiate them from conventional panels
118326 we evaluate every situation on a case by case basis and have no comment regarding the scrabulous developers new application at this time
118327 were encouraged that the developers of scrabulous are continuing to build new and innovative games for users one of the things thats important with all of the new innovation from third parties on facebook platform is that as part of the developer terms of service developers own the intellectual property for the applications they build and attest that their applications do not infringe on any copyright or trademark laws
118328 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
118329 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
118330 at the end of the day there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that
118331 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
118332 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
118333 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
118334 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
118335 the most important thing to me is that were all together and you know its been a tough and painful experience at times but its been very rewarding at the same time
118336 world tour which kicked off june 3 2007 at the monsters of rock festival in milan italy and concluded almost a year to the day later on june 4 2008 in san juan puerto rico

118370 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
118371 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
118372 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
118373 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
118374 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised
118375 popes scorn of the great is too often repeated to be real no man thinks much of that which he despises

118382 for the love of god and my sisters so charitable toward me i take care to appear happy and especially to be so
118383 all severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle

118387 global financial markets continue to be fragile and indicators of systemic risk remain elevated
118388 with inflation risks on the rise the scope for monetary policy to be supportive of financial stability has become more constrained
118389 a bottom for the housing market is not visible we consider this market is still at the centre of this turmoil and some of the valuations still depend on where this market finds a bottom
118390 will continue to head south at a pretty rapid rate in addition to extremely muted mortgage activity latest survey evidence shows that agreed house sales are very low buyer interest is weak it is taking much longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
118391 all these factors point strongly to further declines in house prices
118392 against this backdrop it is not surprising that the high street appears under increasing pressure with consumers scaling back purchases of a range of household goods
118393 you know i love timbaland he is like a brother to me but until the music is done its premature

118395 i believe they were ready for a hip hop act to headline so even before i got onstage there was this rawness

118425 under the new naads we shall support demonstration lead model and nucleus farmers at different levels six homesteads will be selected to act as model farms per parish
118426 this financial year the programme has got funding to cover the remaining 278 sub counties including those in rural and urban areas
118427 most of our herd are found in the communal farms where there are inadequate feeds water and veterinary services
118428 so the project can only succeed if the assignment is given to selected farmers who have enough resources especially some a2 farmers who were privileged to acquire farms with well established dip tanks fences and veterinary services

118443 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
118444 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
118445 but even the acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
118446 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
118447 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
118448 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
118449 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
118450 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
118451 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
118452 president clinton and a veteran of politically charged investigations said stevens is doing his best to seize control of a bad situation mid campaign has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
118453 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
118454 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
118455 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
118456 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
118457 football is an emotional game we would like to drum support into the people so that we can attract maximum interest in the super league this season
118458 they should use the proper channels to get these players
118459 there should be intense debate in the media around the issues contained on the mou
118460 the mou has been made public so as editors we believe it should be debated in public there should be frequent briefings on what is going on behind closed doors the public have a right to comment on it and on other issues
118461 the media has legitimate concerns for instance the tough media laws and the issue of the public media which has a duty to inform the nation but abuses it currently the public media parrots only the voice of the incumbent
118462 the media is being denied access to information it is totally unacceptable we will not be able to know what they are plotting about our future as journalists and the media
118463 we need to know whats going on especially if there are discussions on media law reform
118464 this can only be achieved in an environment that immediately allows citizens to enjoy their fundamental right to freedom of expression association assembly access to information and media freedom
118465 the parties to the negotiations want to turn journalists and the media into fiction writers
118466 naturally we will speculate due to the gravity of the talks which is a historic event that holds the key to the zimbabwe crisis
118467 nothing should be hidden from the public the media have a duty to inform the population of what is happening behind those closed doors in pretoria
118468 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
118469 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
118470 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
118471 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
118472 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
118473 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater
118474 each american who is over the age of 18 of course is allowed to vote in their federal election
118475 it appears that senator brownback has seen both the energy sector and those votes as important to talk to and try to convince them the republican party is the correct one
118476 they have the convention and there are lots of things that happen for the mccain campaign
118477 there is absolutely no doubt that the current conservative party under stephen harper is far more closely tied to the u s republicans than the previous progressive conservative party ever was
118478 if someone wants to be critical im not sure what there is to criticize here because its americans raising money from americans
118479 if we dont invite american leaders to come to canada when they want to when they have a reason to when they want to reach out to the 50 000 voters here in calgary when are they going to come
118480 barletta basically buys into the gop culture of corruption that forced them out of the leadership in congress in 2006 and still persists today special interests like halliburton and oil companies dominate the bush administration lobbyists run the mccain campaign and indicted public officials contribute to barletta
118481 this campaign has not received a contribution from the pac in question
118482 six years ago this pac made a contribution to the 2002 campaign this was long before any allegations were made against the senator

118484 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
118485 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
118486 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
118487 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
118488 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
118489 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
118490 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
118491 it has been a dream of mine ever since i was a little girl
118492 one of the things im really looking forward to is the opening ceremony and walking with athletes from my country in front of thousands of people
118493 hes 100 1 to play for australia and it would be a wonderful experience
118494 because of that case were very twitchy on making sure we are squeaky clean
118495 we need birth certificates passports or other documents stamped by a registrar as proof
118496 they play in the domestic competition and not for les catalans and when they have to play international competition theyre too far off the pace
118497 the jump from club rugby league to international rugby league is just too big for them
118498 theyre good for 40 or 50 minutes and this eight weeks will be very good for them
118499 if youre fit and you keep having a go keep turning up you never know who you can beat
118500 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced

118503 matthews one of those guys that plays in many positions hes played on glass a lot over many years that may happen again
118504 it will be intriguing the match ups and who goes through the midfield on sunday
118505 shaun would just like the guys to play the way he does
118506 i hope the games spirited confrontational at times and its last man standing thats what i hope and thats what ill talk to them about
118507 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
118508 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
118509 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
118510 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
118511 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties
118512 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
118513 its fortuitous that this diagnostic test could be applied to horse flu as its highly unlikely that a similar test could have been developed in a timely manner once the outbreak had been detected
118514 the use of the test supported the decision to try for eventual eradication
118515 and at a much reduced expense to the industry and freeing up horse movements
118516 in saints row 1 hatten wir schon die h lfte hinter uns und dann wurde uns klar dass wir mit dem cell einfach nicht klar kommen

118547 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry
118548 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s markets
118549 i am definitely confident that car is as safe as it can be
118550 at we had quite a lot of trouble in the race i went through the gravel a couple of times and stuff like this which in the end i think was the main reason why we had the problem at hockenheim for me there is no doubt that our car is safe enough to drive in the race and to compete this season when you operate on the limit things happen like this and we analysed it and we know why and there is no reason to have any doubts
118551 there is nothing drastic out of this audit like something horrible is happening
118552 but we need to know where every nickel is spent
118553 so many times you hear that vta is going bankrupt
118554 no were not going bankrupt were financially stable were moving in the right direction
118555 i always felt the revenue projections were so loose they would flop around and were tied to the political environment you cannot allow that to happen and have the public trust you
118556 she is saying we are going take no prisoners and try and beat this back before it qualifies
118557 there may well be people who think madison nguyen is not the right person but the time to make that decision is at the next election
118558 no not for years and years to come unless you change the way the world is run
118559 i must be off now im meeting some one tonight
118560 polly annie and liz say hello my grand grasious good freind
118561 good night my new freind good night my brother we will meet again and with far more than three
118562 it sounds like a song from some cheesy 80s tv show
118563 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
118564 my husband makes a decent living but to live in santa clara valley it takes over 100 000
118565 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
118566 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this
118567 but the dynamic is different this year because of the presidential election
118568 we dont want to get swallowed up in the issues between the two parties
118569 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
118570 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families
118571 the fact that it melted at zero degrees centigrade leaves very little doubt
118572 wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
118573 this is not a complex case and it should move quickly
118574 they have had a lot of time during the grand jury investigation to be preparing
118575 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
118576 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
118577 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
118578 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
118579 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
118580 our state faces a looming cash crisis this situation leaves me with no easy choices
118581 this is not an action that i take lightly i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
118582 the whole place was packed with people trying to figure out how to get served
118583 go ahead were all getting laid off or minimum wage
118584 our workers have received mixed messages from their supervisors about which employees will be exempt and which employees will not be exempt
118585 he cant force us to do anything different than were already doing
118586 he is under pressure and were all under pressure thats why i dont understand why this distraction was needed
118587 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
118588 the rising of phenomenon of men using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families
118589 if a man is caught with a pet the pet will be immediately confiscated and the man will be forced to sign a document pledging not to repeat the act

118596 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
118597 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
118598 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
118599 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
118600 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

118604 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
118605 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
118606 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
118607 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
118608 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
118609 honey be brave get up and follow that horse get back on
118610 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
118611 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
118612 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
118613 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
118614 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
118615 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
118616 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
118617 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
118618 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
118619 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
118620 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
118621 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
118622 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
118623 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
118624 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
118625 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
118626 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
118627 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
118628 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
118629 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
118630 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
118631 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
118632 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
118633 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
118634 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
118635 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
118636 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
118637 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
118638 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
118639 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
118640 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
118641 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
118642 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
118643 theres no question i stink im not denying it i do have an odor ive been playing for 17 hours
118644 it felt like i was being strangled in the water i was wrenched backwards by the fishing line and the hook got caught in my throat
118645 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
118646 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
118647 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
118648 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
118649 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
118650 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
118651 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
118652 who are open to doing something on the production side
118653 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
118654 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
118655 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
118656 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
118657 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
118658 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
118659 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
118660 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
118661 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
118662 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
118663 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
118664 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
118665 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
118666 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
118667 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
118668 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
118669 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
118670 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
118671 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
118672 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
118673 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
118674 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
118675 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
118676 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
118677 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
118678 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
118679 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
118680 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
118681 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
118682 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
118683 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
118684 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
118685 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
118686 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
118687 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
118688 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
118689 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
118690 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
118691 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
118692 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
118693 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
118694 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
118695 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
118696 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
118697 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
118698 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year

118705 our marketing strategy with fall release choke is to get all the chuck palahniuk fans in
118706 the problem is theres no real way to measure how big that base is
118707 maybe weve broken up theres just no plans some members moved away and im concentrating on the cute lepers so you never know we may play again or we might not bands arent supposed to go on forever
118708 its rooted in first wave punk rock like the briefs but theres lots of elements of power pop and mod revival stuff going on with it also and we have backup singers three girls who sing harmonies and smash tambourines together the doors wide open for going in different directions
118709 im one of those nerdy record collectors and love researching and discovering old bands
118710 after i saw joan jett at bumbershoot in 2000 i immediately went to the briefs rehearsal room in downtown seattle and wrote a song that wound up on a 7 inch because i was inspired by her set
118711 im really stoked you know to be on joan jetts record label
118712 im really flattered she liked the music and things are working really well with them so far
118713 it only takes one idiot to lash out and someone could be seriously injured
118714 some people get really aggressive after a few drinks lecturing them and handing out sticks will just make things worse
118715 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
118716 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
118717 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
118718 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
118719 i think some studios go to something like comic con mainly because theyre afraid that if they dont go and their movies dont work someone above them will say why didnt you go to comic con

118725 i cant speak for the prime minister but i presume this will be raised
118726 there are so many power centres in pakistan it is difficult to deal with the situation surely the issue will be raised
118727 we are unhappy with the role isi pakistans inter services intelligence is playing
118728 we have the cleanest evidences that is why we went public and said pakistans isi is behind this it is not just us even the us and other countries are openly saying so that the isi is responsible
118729 the message of kabul was very clear get out of afghanistan
118730 while the ahmedabad and jaipur blasts were similar in bangalore there was a great deal of sophistication
118731 we have some leads but we are not clear about the message behind the attack
118732 definitely the attacks reflect that the capacity of the terrorists has grown
118733 president bush had complained that actionable intelligence shared with pakistan got leaked much before its due time
118734 every one knows who controls the isi but i believe that it should be placed under direct and practical control of chief executive prime minister
118735 continue to work as it is working under the prime minister
118736 self interest demands that pakistan says no to militancy and one can assume that the isi understands the countrys strategic and political interests well enough to refrain from undertaking such unwise adventures
118737 there is a need under the circumstances to forthwith close for good the political wing in the agency while dealing with militancy there is a need to ensure that the agencys activities are in full conformity with government policy
118738 the isi must have a clearly defined charter spelling out its administrative financial and operational control system

118745 countries with dollar denominated assets need to cooperate to find a transition path that weans the united states from foreign credit and foreign oil while at the same time moves emerging economies away from excessive export oriented dependence on us consumption
118746 it also will require expanded effort to find additional options to increase the capacities of middle east energy exporting countries to absorb petrodollar inflows through investment in appropriate forms of human and physical capital

118978 britain has decided that it wants to go down a nuclear route and we have systematically closed down our nuclear industry over the last 15 or 20 years
118979 since we now want to have a nuclear new build programme there is a sense of inevitability that effectively we are going to have to hand our programme over to the french
118980 neither the judiciary nor the security agents issued reason for raiding the houses
118981 they have not given us any reason there are no court papers or any warrant of arrest from the courts or anything from the federal government because he has kept all the terms and conditions given to him by the court

118988 we have always been aware of the energy level that comes along with kers which is way below what a full fuel tank carries in terms of energy
118989 we know there are many road cars handling it successfully with even more electric energy on board so there is no reason why we should not get on top of that
118990 we are still investigating the whole case and we have broadened the case
118991 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
118992 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
118993 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
118994 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years

119009 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
119010 but when he disappeared he put out a piece of disinformation that i had cut a deal with him if he disappeared we wouldnt pursue him that was a completely false statement
119011 he should have been arrested his green mercedes was parked in its parking spot outside his office for six months after the 1995 dayton peace agreement each day the nato commander at the time refused to arrest him even though he had the authority to do so
119012 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
119013 said he was going to call former president jimmy carter his friend
119014 i said fine we work for president clinton you call carter were walking out and the bombing will intensify he agreed that night to lifting the siege of sarajevo

119025 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens

119030 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
119031 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
119032 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating

119060 were here to win an election not throw a party
119061 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
119062 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
119063 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
119064 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
119065 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
119066 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
119067 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton

119069 i mean i agree that i shouldnt force my decision on the group i need to get buy in but cripple my team
119070 no in this case buy in is just a cover up this is a team decision with team responsibility and consequences for the team no matter which way they choose as the leader if you make this decision for the team they are no longer responsible and the consequences are no longer theirs even with buy in when the team suffers the consequences from your decision you will be to blame they will take you to the mat
119071 and your team will gain more experience and momentum in avoiding responsibility than stepping up to the plate as the leader you will cripple your team

119077 the band has a knack for hanging a sharp left that i dont see coming
119078 ive not been sleeping at the moment thinking about running out there ive always wanted to play in a north london derby it will brilliant
119079 hopefully they want to see characters they dont always go just to watch the football theyll come to abuse me ill get the banter but ill enjoy that you dont to have a boring life as a footballer
119080 if you dont get a buzz off thats probably where you fail
119081 there is nothing quite like running out for your country but its probably going to be the best moment in my career one of them anyway
119082 you know how it works life isnt perfect at the time i played for the arse as you call it
119083 that was a time in my career a good time to grow up playing with a lot of talented kids spurs tattoos and are mad fans they kept telling me youve got to come to tottenham and i said i want to but they dont want me now they do so my mates are buzzing now
119084 hopefully its looking that way but only time will tell i want to be a part of that only time will tell and only performances on the football pitch will do that
119085 it was not nice missing out on it and it would be nice to put that right
119086 we have submitted a plan of correction the plan has been accepted and we will work the plan to completion

119092 there are no do or die games until the last one you play
119093 its something that im definitely going to reflect on now and then when im done
119094 i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
119095 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
119096 i just wanted them to forget about the first half and move on like it didnt happen the game was 0 0 and just go play and they handled it very well and they finished the game
119097 richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good
119098 the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
119099 anas such a great person and great athlete i had to stay focused on every point
119100 its not so nice for me to beat two canadians
119101 what can i do the crowd will hate me but thats just the luck of the draw but i think theyre both really great players they have done quite well so i think they have good potential a good future in front of them
119102 i can say im happy with the way i played
119103 but you have to be at your best to play against the no 2 in the world i felt the pressure of her hits they were really hard
119104 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
119105 we havent had any sales yet so were pretty excited
119106 i cant take it anymore and i want true love and happiness
119107 we are carrying out testing and fever screening with the entry and exit board of control office

119111 we call on anyone with information on the crime to come forward so that the perpetrators can be caught tried and brought to justice because this is a criminal offence
119112 leif was 57 but he looked 35 he was in great shape not an ounce of fat on him good looking not even a hint of ill health and now hes gone its really hard to deal with that
119113 he had what every guy wants great looks great athletic skills great intelligence great family
119114 thats what i loved about him he understood it was only a game
119115 youd come off the air and sometimes you were a little chaffed at how crappy the game was or how good the game was and hed say all right the games over lets have a beer on to the next one i think thats a good attitude to have
119116 he always had three or four things on the go
119117 some ex players have a huge ego and their exploits grow with time i think leifs didnt he had his life in perspective
119118 he did what he wanted to do and that was spend time with his family spend time in collingwood play golf and work on the things he wanted to work on its kind of what everybody wants to do and he had it he had it all
119119 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
119120 this shows we are willing to do anything to stop doping iaaf spokesman nick davies said
119121 the iaaf is ready to take on an investigative approach on these issues if it needs to
119122 the iaaf could do nothing better ahead of the games in beijing
119123 our worries arent that great we just have to get him to back off a little and give his shoulder a chance to rest a little bit
119124 medically no one has any concerns about him long term
119125 its something that at the end of the day we may have been able to get the player but it would have been at a very very steep price i dont know if that would have helped us going forward as opposed to setting us back a little more
119126 it picked up speed from about 1 oclock to 3 30 where we thought something was going to get done
119127 but it just unfortunately didnt happen we had some really good talks both parties worked hard but at the end of the day they werent as comfortable with making the trade as we were
119128 when you look up and youre under eight games behind within striking distance of the wild card and theres still two months to play i dont think we ever thought hey were going to be sellers weve taken on the thought process that if we continue to add without taking anything away from us going forward that we would try to do that
119129 we always know the red sox and the yankees are going to be active at this time of the year
119130 the moves just helped them keep pace with what they have basically the team the yankees lost is the team they have right now
119131 all we can control is what we do we have 54 games and we have to play our best baseball if we want to leapfrog people in the wild card
119132 we were ready to go forward at the end of the day seattle didnt feel as comfortable going forward to finish off the trade
119133 we always know the red sox and yankees are going to be active at this time of the year
119134 i think their moves just help them keep pace with what they had nady replaces injured left fielder hideki matsui rodriguez replaces injured catcher jorge posada
119135 we feel like we have a chance in the wild card the divisions probably a longer shot
119136 we might have to bring him along a little slower but everything looked good and hes on the road to recovery
119137 ive watched lesbianism over the last few years slowly become the thing that everyones doing but back in high school there was no l word

119194 het oppompen van vrachtwagenbanden moet in ons land verplicht in een veiligheidskooi gebeuren maar de arbeidsinspectie is daar bijzonder laks in en controleert die procedure nauwelijks daardoor zijn er garages die het niet zo nauw nemen omdat dit tijdverlies betekent

119196 de arbeidsongevallenverzekering van de werkgever komt wel tussenbeide in zon gevallen in het geval van kasterlee zullen ouders en zussen of broers vergoed worden en is er ook een tussenkomst voorzien in de begrafeniskosten
119197 de band waar ben aan moest werken was de dag voordien al door andere werknemers bij autobanden sooi opgepompt
119198 dat de band ontplofte was een puur ongeluk normaal gebeurt dat niet hebben ze mij verzekerd voor de handeling die ben uitvoerde was ook helemaal geen speciale kooi nodig alles was perfect in orde niemand treft schuld
119199 i fought a master of song fu and did pretty damn well
119200 in 2005 i left my day job writing software to pursue music full time
119201 youre right i almost went with the first monkey in space but i didnt want to be accused of going overboard with the monkeys so i went with the first dog in space instead
119202 big dick farts a polka in the style of paul amp storm
119203 when i first read the final challenge i was at once excited and scared such a great song to use for inspiration and also a very high bar to get over i mean trying to measure up to a bowie song is bad enough but trying to do it and do it better than jonathan coulton yeah no problem ill get right on that right away i decided to do try something grand to keep in the spirit of the original whether or not i achieved that remains to be seen i didnt want to try to be funny because a its not really a funny story and b im not going to do funny better than my competition im just not so here you go the end result to sum it up i just really tried to re do the song with my own song writing and production style i think i achieved that for better or worse
119204 heres a woman who ran around with the mascot of an all you can eat palace working on behalf of kids
119205 she wasnt just trying to promote herself she was working from her heart
119206 she was always there to say what can i do
119207 she was a unique breed she was an advocate for youth but also an advocate for people
119208 this woman impacted more peoples lives than any mayor any civic official
119209 everything she did for the community was for and about kids period
119210 its all about showing children that there are caring adults out there to help provide positive paths for them to take
119211 following the unprovoked and callous murder of mr kok foss high school and the surrounding community were l eft in disorganized panic which was indicative of the shocking neglect by the tacoma school district in the areas of both preventing and responding to school violence
119212 with all due respect to judge larkin the washington state supreme court has clearly held that cities may hold annexation as a condition of providing services
119213 you dont have to agree with the city and their policies and whether annexation is an issue or not its irrelevant really
119214 the city has committed to providing water service in its comprehensive plan and thats without regard to annexation agreements
119215 puyallup officials are just trying to find a way to bring as many people into the city as possible
119216 as long as this is in appeal we should not be dealing with this matter
119217 im not willing to pass an ordinance right after a judge says we cant do it saying we can do it anyway
119218 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act and its amendments and ministerial regulations
119219 theres no winners in this because the industry has addicted a whole bunch of young people who then became lifetime annuities for these companies
119220 yes we are looking at privatizing bec after weve completed the exercise at btc
119221 we recognize that there are a number of initiatives that are necessary at bec and we feel that it may be best for the bahamas that we look at bec look at what is demanded of it look at what the bahamian people require and see how best we can deliver on that
119222 we have to go through a planning stage and put together our programme and we will express it to the bahamian people when we have completed that exercise
119223 we are now faced with an organization that is incurring financial losses
119224 right now theres a huge need for financial injection into bec to meet some of its development plans for instance when we look at the need to meet demand in new providence which is growing at approximately eight percent a year which is significant growth we are required to install at clifton pier two slow speed generators
119225 this entire project is estimated to cost over 300 million its a significant amount of cash thats needed to develop bec bec is not in a position to meet that demand at this time and so we would have to go out to a private entity to assist us because we cant obtain those funds readily from the public treasury
119226 this is a huge amount of money that exceeds 500 million that we have to put into bec at this particular time
119227 in addition to the need for development theres also the need to combat the rising cost of oil consumers are complaining on a daily basis about their electricity bills we know that
119228 we are not in control of the price of oil and that is where the increase is being incurred so we have to be creative and we have to find other ways to provide energy that are available to us and one of the things that we always say is look at our blessings
119229 were blessed with beautiful cool breezes and were blessed with ocean we have recognized this government that there are opportunities available for us in the renewable energy avenue
119230 we still have to have evidence that youre not fit to practice
119231 if somebody did have one of those degrees in their personnel file and they didnt use that degree to misrepresent themselves then we wouldnt take any action
119232 the only practical solution is to use a wet chemical fire extinguisher that is specifically formulated from a cocktail of potassium salts to tackle this type of fire the wet chemical reagent reacts with the burning oils creating soapy foam that covers cools and smothers the fire in the absence of a wet chemical extinguisher deploying a fire blanket over the blaze is arguably the next best option

119245 we take this stuff so seriously which is why we are trying to prosecute this guy to the full extent of the law
119246 when our officers got there one of them found him at the rear of the high school on foot no vehicle no dog no luggage
119247 he kind of looked blank there was no look of fear or concern
119248 i have a real one from italy and i knew there were no cane corso breeders in the nine county bay area
119249 i looked at his dogs and said those are neopolitans bred with pit bulls
119250 made me run my shoes through a little bucket of clorox he said he didnt want his dogs to get infected from human bacteria the whole place was full of feces
119251 he kept telling me he was breeding the macho dog that would be more powerful than pit bulls and be great for dog fights or guide dogs
119252 from the outset i thought it was a little strange because he asked me to bring him dog food out of my pocket
119253 he brought me to the back of his property and said oh yeah i have these two males cane corsos they were in an 8 foot by 8 foot kennel filled with feces and the dogs should have weighed 110 pounds they weighed 45 pounds and had no hair on their bodies you could see their spinal cords

119269 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
119270 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
119271 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
119272 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates

119282 the red sox will have no announcement tonight there are still issues to be finalized
119283 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
119284 from a personal standpoint im sad because i got to know manny
119285 but at the same time i feel its for the best not only for him but for us as a team like manny said lets turn the page and move on we are a good team and we are still capable of winning and we know what it takes to bring another ring for the city
119286 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
119287 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
119288 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
119289 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
119290 we were touring when i was pregnant until about eight months
119291 then we started touring again when our first baby was 10 weeks old you know when you have kids the first time is such a shock to the system well there were a lot of sleepless nights and scatterbrained shows but by six months we were a well oiled machine
119292 wed do the sound check and id go back to the baby
119293 go play a set and go right back feed her and get her back to sleep we felt a little guilty we used to hang out with the other bands a little more but our life is different now
119294 shes 10 minutes from our house shes around a lot
119295 the only time theyre not with us is the hour that we are playing and the hour we are sound checking
119296 it was a playdate every single day at the club
119297 ive lived in a couple areas in the city but i always wanted to live here there is hustle and bustle but its not crazy and its clean
119298 here there are tons of nice little independent shops there is something for everyone
119299 its just a really good mix of people and you can do anything you can go and have a cappuccino on a patio or have sushi or go to a rock bar and have pints at the back
119300 ive never gone there for club nights but ive seen some really great bands there
119301 i think its sometimes overlooked because people think its kind of a clubby place
119302 ive never been in this place but i am a huge fan of restaurant makeover and it was in it
119303 its got a really cool back patio thats kind of tucked away
119304 even the coleslaw and baked beans are the best youve ever had
119305 every time i move somewhere new which is a few times my parents usually come and hang out i was super excited for my parents to come and see my place and my dad loves barbecue so i was really excited to take my dad there he totally loved it
119306 if you get a quesadilla its huge you get it in like a pizza box
119307 i took my mom there and she loved it she had two flavours together like lime and chocolate or something crazy
119308 where im from windsor there are not many independent businesses so its nice to have all these small cool little places
119309 especially at night when the trees have the lights on them its a good vibe
119310 this is where i do all my laundry and they have an internet caf and convenience store they always have now magazine so you can read and hang out
119311 when i do laundry it ends up costing me quite a bit of money because i end up coming in here
119312 youll notice they put the flyers of local bands in the windows
119313 forget london paris or new york the arab gulf is where glamorous hijab is at
119314 and boy do those khaleeji girls know how to rock their shaylas
119315 some people both muslim and non muslim seem to find the notion of hijab fashion and my blog is about style for goodness sake not fashion a contradictory concept
119316 apparently modesty dictates that you look as blah as possible
119317 there is nothing wrong with having a personal sense of style islam does not dictate to us which colours to wear or which hijab wrap is the best
119318 i think its very good to be creative with the hijab
119319 when my non muslim friends and colleagues see me they get very excited they want me to teach them how to tie the different styles

119330 doing the best we can to do our part to take care of the environment
119331 at the same time we know that the deities want us to take care of ourselves to stand on our own two feet as individuals as families as a community as a nation
119332 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
119333 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
119334 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
119335 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
119336 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people
119337 at the end of the day there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that
119338 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
119339 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
119340 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
119341 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
119342 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
119343 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
119344 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
119345 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
119346 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
119347 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
119348 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
119349 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
119350 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
119351 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
119352 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
119353 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
119354 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
119355 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
119356 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
119357 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
119358 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
119359 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
119360 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
119361 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
119362 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
119363 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
119364 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
119365 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
119366 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
119367 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
119368 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
119369 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
119370 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
119371 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
119372 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
119373 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
119374 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
119375 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
119376 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
119377 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
119378 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
119379 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
119380 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
119381 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
119382 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
119383 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
119384 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
119385 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
119386 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
119387 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
119388 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
119389 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
119390 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
119391 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
119392 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
119393 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
119394 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
119395 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
119396 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
119397 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
119398 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
119399 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
119400 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
119401 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
119402 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
119403 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
119404 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
119405 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
119406 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
119407 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
119408 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
119409 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
119410 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
119411 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
119412 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
119413 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
119414 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
119415 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
119416 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
119417 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
119418 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
119419 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
119420 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
119421 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
119422 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
119423 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
119424 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
119425 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
119426 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
119427 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
119428 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
119429 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
119430 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
119431 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
119432 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
119433 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
119434 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
119435 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
119436 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
119437 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
119438 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
119439 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
119440 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
119441 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
119442 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
119443 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
119444 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
119445 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
119446 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
119447 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
119448 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
119449 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
119450 my business is my life and im ok with that
119451 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
119452 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
119453 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
119454 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
119455 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
119456 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
119457 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
119458 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
119459 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
119460 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
119461 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
119462 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
119463 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
119464 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
119465 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
119466 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
119467 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
119468 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
119469 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
119470 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
119471 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
119472 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
119473 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
119474 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
119475 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
119476 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
119477 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
119478 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
119479 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
119480 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
119481 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
119482 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
119483 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
119484 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
119485 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
119486 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
119487 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
119488 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
119489 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
119490 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
119491 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
119492 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
119493 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
119494 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
119495 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
119496 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
119497 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
119498 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
119499 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
119500 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
119501 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
119502 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
119503 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
119504 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
119505 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
119506 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
119507 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
119508 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
119509 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
119510 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
119511 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
119512 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
119513 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
119514 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
119515 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
119516 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
119517 english coastal towns can look forward to the summer trade that comes with more and more people rediscovering all that these places have to offer for a great holiday or weekend break
119518 this funding will help these towns prosper further as more attractions become available for both tourists and residents to enjoy
119519 and have an allotted number of birds to collect typically between 500 and 1 000
119520 every single one of those hens will have a home waiting for her when we get back
119521 we check through them to make sure they are fit and healthy to go and then during the afternoon we have a steady stream of people taking them off to their nice new homes
119522 i think people feel compassion for them really theyve never seen the outside world theyve never felt the sun on their back nor the wind in their feathers
119523 weve built them a chicken shed in the garden which is nice and big
119524 most of the time theyre going to live free range in the garden and when were not around theyre going to go into the run
119525 a year ago on our sons sixth birthday he asked if he could have chickens and we said if he was still serious a year later he could have them a year later that was all he wanted
119526 so we gave him his birthday money and hes just donated it to the trust for his chickens
119527 we took him to a poultry store to see the pure breeds but he decided he wanted ex battery hens and decided to wait for these
119528 within two weeks we think they have a fair level of fitness again their feathers take a little while to come through but soon enough theyll all be back
119529 a farmer will pay about 3 45 for an egg laying chicken but after 12 13 months theyre considered spent and the smaller battery farmer will have problems getting rid of them to make way for his next lot of birds
119530 the dealers want to collect several thousand birds at a time if they cant theyll charge the farmers for taking the hens away which could be as much as 25 30 pence a bird
119531 it takes 6 7 000 to fill a wagon and if they have to make four to five pick ups to fill up it will take too long and be uneconomical
119532 if they work with the battery hen welfare trust it doesnt cost the farmer and the new owners will get a nice hen for their garden and thatll give them eggs for the next couple of years
119533 obviously we want as many birds free ranging as possible but we also acknowledge that there is a great threat from imported cheap caged eggs
119534 go for it have fun dont wait till our son finishes school thats like forever
119535 im sorry to say i need to leave thank you for the opportunity
119536 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
119537 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
119538 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
119539 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
119540 every window on alcatraz has a view of san francisco
119541 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
119542 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
119543 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
119544 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
119545 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
119546 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
119547 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
119548 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
119549 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
119550 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
119551 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
119552 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
119553 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
119554 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
119555 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
119556 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
119557 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
119558 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
119559 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
119560 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
119561 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
119562 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
119563 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
119564 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
119565 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
119566 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
119567 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
119568 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
119569 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
119570 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
119571 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
119572 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
119573 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
119574 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
119575 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
119576 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
119577 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
119578 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
119579 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
119580 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
119581 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
119582 m me le pape est lu par ses pairs mais les anglicans eux ont un homme nomm par un gouvernement s culier le leadership spirituel dune communion mondiale de provinces ind pendantes et autonomes ne devrait pas tre r duit un homme nomm par un gouvernement s culier
119583 devrait faire preuve de repentance et exprimer ses regrets avant que nous puissions partager la communion cette ordination a ignor lautorit biblique en violant clairement lenseignement biblique contre le comportement homosexuel comment pouvons nous partager la sainte communion participer des groupes d tude de la bible et partager des repas ensemble en pr tendant que tout va bien que nous sommes encore des camarades de ceux qui persistent violer lenseignement biblique et les r solutions de lambeth
119584 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
119585 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
119586 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
119587 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
119588 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
119589 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
119590 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
119591 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
119592 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
119593 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
119594 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
119595 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
119596 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
119597 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
119598 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
119599 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
119600 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
119601 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
119602 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
119603 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
119604 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
119605 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
119606 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
119607 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
119608 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
119609 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
119610 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
119611 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
119612 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
119613 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
119614 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
119615 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
119616 not really so much the fact that i might lose it just the fact that i couldnt perform the best i could here without the pain
119617 now obviously im a little bit scared because the mri shows nothing but i still have pain
119618 they say its going to go away but its already there for 10 days so im going to try and see the doctor now and try to get it out
119619 it was a fun match actually i enjoyed myself it was a good fight
119620 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
119621 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
119622 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
119623 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
119624 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
119625 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
119626 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
119627 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
119628 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
119629 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
119630 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
119631 being positive is almost as hard as writing about bad news theres a sense that i dont want to tempt any kind of fate i must and have prepared myself for the worst we now know that my father suffered an aneurysm he underwent an operation the main difficult operation yesterday morning at a neurological unit in manchester the doctors have expressed satisfaction with how things went and they say that today they might try to wake him hes been heavily sedated for days there is a long way to go and many things could yet happen however i wanted to pass on this news and to again thank everybody who has written in support
119632 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
119633 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
119634 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
119635 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
119636 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
119637 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
119638 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
119639 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
119640 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
119641 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
119642 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
119643 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
119644 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
119645 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
119646 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
119647 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
119648 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
119649 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
119650 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
119651 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
119652 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
119653 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
119654 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
119655 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
119656 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
119657 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
119658 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
119659 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
119660 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
119661 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
119662 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
119663 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege

119683 the most important help that people can give us in fighting inflation is that they defend their income we cant get used to buying everything at any price

119685 just because people live in public housing does not mean they can be cut off from political debate
119686 public housing tenants have exactly the same rights as everyone else to be involved in our democracy and housing authority officials violate the first amendment when they block political campaigning and registration efforts at their doorsteps
119687 moreover political campaigners also have a first amendment right to go door to door to disseminate their views in public housing developments just as they would in any other place
119688 door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people

119696 the kidnapping of prof dinampo really scared them this is a sensitive situation and a sensitive area for us to observe
119697 i dont want to scare you too much i myself i am afraid sometimes its unpredictable you may not have problems at all
119698 the local situation is not so good they worry that if they come they cant go back
119699 they will be briefed about these they are not advised to go to the hot hot areas
119700 its not particularly dangerous there theres always a level of tension that youd expect n an area like that but everything seems to be quiet but we still want to be careful youll have to exercise a lot of sound judgment
119701 we dont want to be accompanied by soldiers we want to appear impartial to maximize our work in the ground
119702 we dont ask them to go to dangerous places it also helps that they are asian observers
119703 they dont look too different from filipinos and they wont attract too much attention
119704 our role is different from journalists who want to take a good picture of dangerous incidents this is not our role
119705 its just a regional elections political interest is low im expecting that security threat is reduced i hope everything will be okay
119706 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
119707 since there is no declaration of election postponement international observers speculated that the election will be conducted in due time and in a peaceful manner
119708 when there are people observing what you are doing you are always on your toes especially foreign observers at that it is a reflection of how well we are doing in our elections exercise if we do it correctly we will get a free ride in the media we can learn also from them they can tell us how elections are held in other places theyve observed
119709 insofar as we are concerned there is no postponement we cannot postpone we will go on with the exercise even if its postponed to test the system
119710 from a logistical point of view this is easier for us we did it before in armm
119711 but its different now because the election is automated and the national situation is uncertain these are the complicating factors
119712 as indonesian id like to learn and recommend to m government to automate our elections
119713 the team aims to study the development of the system and the actual practice that could be different from the general elections conducted in armm last year

119726 absolutely were actually trying to crack that were trying to figure out some ideas for it but yes it would be a prequel
119727 in the prequel its slightly different because its earlier we were three years later so we did a lot of research into the way nature would have sort of overtaken the city with the cracks in the streets and the weeds
119728 the first time you got out there and shut down 6th avenue its like how are we going to do this day after day after day but by the end its just like you know how to do it you got the p a s who know how to shut it down how to let the traffic through in between set ups and you just sort of get the routine down so thats not the issue
119729 screaming passengers fled in terror from a greyhound bus as an unidentified fellow passenger suddenly stabbed a man sleeping next to him decapitated him and waved the severed head at horrified witnesses standing outside the apparently unprovoked assault left 36 men women and children stranded wednesday night on the shoulder of the darkening trans canada highway near portage la prairie man about 85 kilometres west of winnipeg watching while the bus driver and a driver of a nearby truck shut the crazed attacker inside the bus with the mangled victim he walks up to the door holds the head in the door just looks at them crazy like and drops the head and walks back to the body and starts cutting more caton told cnn he and other passengers prevented the attacker from getting off the blood soaked bus by threatening him with makeshift weapons a hammer and a crowbar caton and other passengers said the attacker and his victim who was listening to music on headphones were sitting together at the rear of the bus and the attack appeared to be unprovoked no words were exchanged caton described the man who attacked the passenger as possibly asian or aboriginal bald and wearing sunglasses he seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred said caton adding he was struck by how calm the man was caton said the victim boarded in edmonton was aboriginal in appearance was wearing hip hop clothing and appeared to be around 20 years of age
119730 mr caton who served five years in the canadian forces and was closest to the attacker paused before leaving torn momentarily between concern for his own safety and the thought of abandoning the bleeding victim he turned to another man nearby and asked for his help i said give me a hand and lets get this guy and the other guy took off he said it was only moments later that the victims screams went silent mr caton knew he was too late
119731 the man was left alone with the body and witnesses say that he performed further indignities to the victim we have word from people on the scene that when the killer was alone with the body that there may have been some small acts of cannibalism on the body oliver said oliver said that police have not confirmed that but have not denied it either
119732 this is an important milestone in the hanley grange project our proposals have been developed following a wide ranging consultation with government departments and local organisations along with nearby residents
119733 the plan integrates social economic and environmental elements to ensure the development is supported by the physical infrastructure required for an eco town
119734 the masterplan brings to life our vision of an exemplar environmentally sustainable community it is focussed on how people want to live and provides the community facilities they need close to their homes
119735 the plan provides a clear blueprint for developing communities in the future and will deliver an eco town which successive generations can be proud of
119736 making our homes more energy efficient and lessening their impact on the environment is not only crucial to help the uk meet its target for reducing carbon emissions by a minimum of 60 by the year 2050 but also to protect some of the most vulnerable households in the country who are already struggling to pay their energy bills
119737 while fuel tax credits will be an important lifeline for vulnerable households they are going to be an increasingly expensive short term stop gap that simply wont address the key issue the amount of energy we use
119738 we urge government to create a green homes target for our existing housing stock and launch a long term programme similar in approach to the successful decent homes initiative the prospect of spending more and more money on subsidising fuel bills is not the answer
119739 it is not sustainable however you look at it not only will it eat in to precious public funds but it will do little to dampen our demand and consumption of energy or cut carbon emissions
119740 by working together to retrofit existing housing we have the possibility to make a real difference to help people pay their bills as well as leave an even bigger legacy for the nation

119810 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity

119813 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
119814 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a las vegas chefs project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
119815 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
119816 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
119817 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
119818 i triple check and test all our las vegas chefs website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
119819 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
119820 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
119821 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible

119829 jeg sidder aldrig og t nker hvordan t nker b rn vil b rn forst det her hvis jeg g r det har jeg tabt
119830 det er vigtigere at de voksne begynder at le end at skrive den ned p et niveau hvor det f rst og fremmest g lder om at barnet ler s m b rnene sp rge og l re og s m for ldrene tage en snak med dem om det
119831 da jeg f rst begyndte med kurt syntes jeg at rigtig mange b rneb ger var grotesk kedelige de er s forudsigelige og s s de og der findes da mange gode undtagelser men en stor majoritet er fortsat grotesk kedelige derudover skal b rneb ger fortsat selv om de er nok s gode have en morale og det er morsomt at harcelere over og lege med
119832 ja og for eksempel i kurt blir grusom er det at hvis du f r penge s bliver du grusom men det er mere en leg med en tematik end det er en tematik det er en ironisk leg med det at b rneb ger skal have en tydelig p dagogisk morale det er ironi for b rn og det landskab kan jeg rigtig godt lide for vi plejer jo at sige at et barn er helt rent og derfor ikke kan forst sarkasme og s videre s det med at bruge sarkasme til b rn er meget tillokkende p mig
119833 det er jo altid morsomt med tyskere og n jagtighed og ekstremisme og milj bev gelsen og s videre verden er jo s absurd at man beh ver bare at l se den f rste den bedste avis man finder og s har man nok stof til et forfatterskab
119834 det betyder at det er forbudt at st vsuge i skoven siger bud det var dog forf rdelig rgerligt siger kurt men stop en halv har du l rt at l se vi l ser en del i b rnehaven forklarer bud stort set kun ganske overfladiske tekster om s de sm dyr jeg er rlig talt lidt tr t af det men bogstaverne har jeg l rt for l ngst der er jo ikke s mange af dem f rre end tredive hvis jeg husker rigtigt har du l rt at t lle ogs sp rger kurt ja vist kan jeg t lle siger bud men det er jo helt fantastisk siger kurt det er slet ikke normalt at folk p din alder kan l se og t lle det ved jeg ingenting om siger bud men det er sandt siger kurt det er en sensation vi kan tjene mange penge p dig penge er ikke alt siger bud
119835 det er en harcelering mod karismatiske kristne kurt bliver kristen og bliver pastor i kurtby i sverige det er en leg med knutby hvis du husker det forf rdelige der skete uden for uppsala hvor der skete drab og s videre under omst ndigheder som var helt absurde

119850 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
119851 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
119852 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
119853 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
119854 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
119855 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
119856 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
119857 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
119858 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
119859 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver
119860 if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him
119861 rosary beads a priests collar and a bible or breviary
119862 likely to cause offence contrary to taste and decency guidelines
119863 there were bottles cans of beer bricks and all sorts coming over towards the kids the kids were terrified some of them are 14 others are 15
119864 well the short answer to that is yes and then if the opportunity to arrest and prosecute is there we will
119865 policing here is still very much enshrined in politics no other police service has an imc independent monitoring commission no other police service has an iicd
119866 i cant wait to play against arsenal ive not been sleeping at the moment thinking about running out there ive always wanted to play in a north london derby people want to see characters they dont always go just to watch the football theyll come to abuse me paul gascoigne was my favourite player the first shirt i ever got was a tottenham shirt with gazza on the back he was everything to me a footballer who enjoyed his life and played with freedom
119867 we cannot hide the fact that we need new players everybody knows it i know it the players know it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts it is ok getting fit but you have got to be able to play better there is not enough competition for the players to realise that if they play poorly they will not be selected we are a long way away from where we think we are going to be but that is due to several different circumstances we are having to use some of the lads more than we would like to but some of them are just not playing well some of them are going to have to start looking at their own performances because we do not have any competition for places maybe it is a little bit easy for them we do not have enough players to cope with what we have got just now it is a big concern
119868 barton has been stripped of other perks at newcastle such as a corporate box at st james park and the occasional use of a club driver
119869 barton could do something more tangible to illustrate his determination to rehabilitate himself
119870 spurs attack for the first day of the season at middlesbrough on aug 16 with bentley on the right arshavin in the hole behind pavlyuchenko and luka modric on the left
119871 is roy hodgsons judgement better than that of lawrie sanchez
119872 newcastle are furious and privately suggest this represents a tentative form of double jeopardy however the fa can cite countless examples whereby workers have been disciplined independently by their professional governing bodies after the resolution of criminal actions with the fa running a respect agenda and public outrage growing at newcastles refusal to sack barton who was released from prison on monday after serving time for a separate assault sanctions threaten to be severe significantly any amateur footballer whose livelihood did not depend on the sport could expect a lifetime ban in similar circumstances
119873 faces a 10 match ban for his attack on former manchester city team mate ousmane dabo after the fa yesterday charged him with violent conduct he could also be hit with a fine of more than 75 000 for the training ground assault on dabo who was left unconscious astonishingly newcastle who have faced widespread condemnation for their decision to stand by barton contested the announcement from soho square
119874 the times can reveal that barton has been stripped of other perks at newcastle such as a corporate box at st james park and the occasional use of a club driver but the english games governing body insists that football must have a role in policing itself the 25 year old was recently given a four month sentence suspended for two years ordered to pay 3 000 compensation and to perform 200 hours of community service as a result of the dabo incident
119875 barton is a changed man his supporters say but we have heard that before so forgive us our scepticism forgive us too for suggesting that barton could do something more tangible to illustrate his determination to rehabilitate himself be it financially or by making some kind of contribution to society all we know is that he hasnt had a drink for seven months gave 25 000 to charity and refuses to take a pay cut from 65 000 a week to 30 grand
119876 the fa imposed bans on eric cantona john hartson and ben thatcher for their violent acts whats different here that barton has already gone through the courts for the assault doesnt change the fas entitlement to punish him he broke both the law of the land and the laws of the game he deserves two punishments
119877 spurs turnover in personnel is remarkable spurs attack for the first day of the season at middlesbrough on aug 16 could be bentley on the right arshavin in the hole behind pavlyuchenko and luka modric on the left ramos stressed he would juggle his resources depending on the assignment
119878 bentley who was presented as a spurs player yesterday has cultivated his public image as carefully as beckham and the no 7 shirt at spurs was intended to be part of the package he was dismayed to learn that lennon was given the number previously worn by full back paul stalteri by manager juande ramos over the weekend and wore it in the friendly against leyton orient on wednesday bentley has agreed to settle for no 5
119879 now we have lost robbie keane our equal top scorer if dimitar berbatov is not at the club next season we will have to find two new players who can score 40 goals also the new signings are going to take time to settle maybe even a season there are exciting times ahead but i think top four this season will be too much of a tough ask
119880 most realistic spurs fans would tell you that they dont expect to crash the champions league places this season but what they can expect is to be entertained like a 21st century and better version of ossies five man attack juande ramos is putting together a team that could feature giovanni dos santos luka modric andrei arshavin and david bentley probably behind a single out and out striker thats four new young ish attack minded players and possibly five if roman pavlyuchenko joins the revolution and that is a concept that must appeal to neutrals who have got bored with the premier league and the thou shalt not pass tactics of even the supposed chasing pack
119881 most active premier league operator in the transfer market with this weeks capture of the right back fredrik stoor from rosenborg taking their summer acquisitions to eight and andrew johnson next in line
119882 the question exercising owner mohamed mind will be is roy hodgsons judgement better than that of lawrie sanchez the truth will not be revealed until the season starts but there does look to have been more quality on hodgsons shopping list the veteran itinerant manager has used his extensive contacts wisely making fayeds largesse go further by bringing in several players on free transfers
119883 keanes ability and flexibility mean that he can play as a front man useful should torres need a rest or be injured as a second striker or indeed on the right or left of a three behind torres given how much benitez likes to tinker keane is a dream the irishman is a punchier more creative and more compelling support player to the spanish striker than dirk kuyt and should allow steven gerrard to drop back into the centre of midfield or to the right side of a midfield four as he has done with great effect in the past should liverpool go 4 4 2
119884 11 kieron dyer west ham united 12 million broke a leg soon after moving to upton park last summer but that has not stopped 80 000 rolling into his bank account every week
119885 george weah is unquestionably the leading success story in his five seasons at milan he won two scudetti scoring important goals and becoming the first non european to win the ballon dor in 1995 but other players such as sunday oliseh shabani nonda or mido came to italy often with impressive r sum s and vanished without leaving a trace in part this has been due to club coaches own lack of familiarity with the players failing to appreciate and properly integrate them into their tactics in part this is also because most african players arrive in italy having been formed in other leagues such as ligue 1 or even the premiership in these cases they face the same difficulties in adapting to italian footballs different demands and requirements that any other french or british player could face only exacerbated by diffidence
119886 i have to admit i fully expected an mls all stars victory but not as easily as some of the hundreds of press men who had descended on toronto seemed to think an under strength but still competitive west ham became the all stars fifth consecutive victims in a game that showcased all that was good and not so good about mls the things weve been speaking about all season it seems
119887 i was on top of the world last summer i felt like i couldnt do anything wrong my confidence was so high every time i stepped on the field i felt like could bring something special to the team then the whole process starts over it seems like i hit the worst bumps along the road im not sure i ever fit in to the style of play they wanted at derby
119888 more and more consumers are concerned about the issue of toxic chemicals in commonly used products especially products related to children
119889 while the best car and child car seat manufacturers are starting to pay attention far too many companies have not yet phased out these dangerous chemicals
119890 if you has asked me a month ago i would have given you a different reply but right now i feel quite happy with how we are sitting
119891 there was not much to get excited about three or four weeks ago but it has unfolded quickly since then
119892 the strength we have now is that we have experience we have got old hands who can quickly point the younger blokes in the right direction and that is something quite invaluable in the competition this year
119893 it was felt it was a good chance to bring him into the waikato environment with the view to giving him some game time off the bench
119894 i have bracketed loose forward jordan smiler with full back james kamana on the bench
119895 i wont be making a decision until game day as to whether we will go with more forwards than normal in the reserves it is a call i will make depending on weather conditions on the day
119896 we take this stuff so seriously which is why we are trying to prosecute this guy to the full extent of the law
119897 when our officers got there one of them found him at the rear of the high school on foot no vehicle no dog no luggage
119898 he kind of looked blank there was no look of fear or concern
119899 i have a real one from italy and i knew there were no cane corso breeders in the nine county bay area
119900 i looked at his dogs and said those are neopolitans bred with pit bulls
119901 made me run my shoes through a little bucket of clorox he said he didnt want his dogs to get infected from human bacteria the whole place was full of feces
119902 he kept telling me he was breeding the macho dog that would be more powerful than pit bulls and be great for dog fights or guide dogs
119903 from the outset i thought it was a little strange because he asked me to bring him dog food out of my pocket
119904 he brought me to the back of his property and said oh yeah i have these two males cane corsos they were in an 8 foot by 8 foot kennel filled with feces and the dogs should have weighed 110 pounds they weighed 45 pounds and had no hair on their bodies you could see their spinal cords
119905 i heard the dogs barking and a lot of screaming and then all of a sudden it stopped
119906 the kids came over banging on the door saying their house was on fire and i said where is your mother
119907 i was always telling her what was she doing with him i didnt really like him he didnt have a job or a car
119908 she was saying she was dying and moaning somebody call 911 somebody talk to me she then just laid down
119909 she was very nice very quiet paid her rent on time
119910 that said these statistics are still teaching us things and we need to constantly be looking at how we use force
119911 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
119912 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
119913 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
119914 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect
119915 if i were chief of police in san jose and i heard my officers never used deadly force once it would be a headline

119937 he was my bus driver a white man this morning as with every other morning the bus was filled with my fellow impoverished blacks and hispanics passengers
119938 the difference before this morning id never heard his thoughts
119939 though now ive learned how to tune them out white peoples thoughts remain the vilest things id ever heard
119940 while black people think about sex and acquiring nice things every imagination of white people is reprobate and perverse
119941 the excerpt above is from new author dae nigare in
119942 the emergence of the 21st century has become the most exciting period for the people in america whose ancestors were the slaves in the trans atlantic slave trade
119943 the excitement is the result of learning the differences between phaeomelanin and eumelanin and the unique relationship each has with the sun e now know that our extra sensory perception is a direct result of our intentional activation of the 3rd eye
119944 likewise it activates the pheromone that has lied dormant in us since our exiled mecca to this planet
119945 the mythological 3rd eye which is the pineal gland is accessed at the single point where the streams of vision of the two eyes meet
119946 the white mans 3rd eye appears on the back of his dollar bill because the one in his brain has no functionality
119947 but i cant send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this it has to be saved for posterity
119948 i have something to show you that you wont believe
119949 there is no doubt that the earth continues to change but it has nothing to do with anything man does or has done
119950 there is no doubt that the earth continues to change but it has nothing to do with anything man does or has done

119953 there have been about 8 000 heat related deaths in the united states the past quarter century
119954 analysis of the national center for health statistics compressed mortality file showed that between 1979 and 2004 there were 10 827 cold related deaths and 5 279 heat related deaths
119955 and id like to say from my standpoint it tastes very fine
119956 and its been proving very successful and mars has certainly proved itself to be interesting
119957 i ask for a little patience here as we get to the part of the mission where we do the scientific analysis of the soil and contact with ice

119960 its such a great refreshing white wine for summer this is exactly what i want to be drinking outside on a summer day
119961 that senator obama would have inserted such a note in such a place with the serried ranks of the worlds media lenses pointing at him without at the very least harbouring the teensiest suspicion that within seconds it would be removed and its contents find their way into a newspaper
119962 why is it that politicians on the religious left are respected for their sincerity piety and humility while those of the religious right are judged to be fanatical fundamentalist superficial and hypocritical
119963 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future
119964 his grace investigates with moral seriousness and intellectual rigour bringing some refreshing common sense to some of the touchiest subjects in british politics
119965 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative
119966 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
119967 it would slow down the democratic process and hinder the work being done on lcos legislative competence orders
119968 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
119969 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit
119970 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media
119971 at the moment consumers dont know where to go if they want to complaint about something they have seen on the internet
119972 the absence of any industry body is leading to a great deal of confusion and to widely differing practices
119973 the idea is that a self regulatory body like the advertising standards authority would be set up to make sure that members including internet companies and search engines subscribe to the code and abide by rulings
119974 the truth is that without a statutory base any regulatory body which is voluntary will be toothless from the start
119975 it is understood that it would also be able to order bloggers and social networking sites such as bebo and myspace to take down offensive messages or photographs
119976 i cannot conceive that i would sign up to a regulatory code and i doubt many other blogs would
119977 if someone posts something on iains blog which x regards as offensive to x the fact that iain after thoughtful consideration decides to leave it there is hardly justice
119978 imagine if this story confirmed climate change existed youd be sure it would be all over the ten oclock news on the bbc
119979 you allowed the posts but didnt correct your incorrect story
119980 but surely a blog is more like a conversation a piece of opinion rather than say a phd thesis
119981 it is difficult to identify any integrity in the role of the courts to uphold the rule of law
119982 if the courts are to abdicate in response to a threat from a foreign power
119983 those who wish to deliver a threat designed to interfere with our internal domestic system of law need to be told that they cannot achieve their objective
119984 extremely distasteful that an independent public official should feel himself obliged to give way to threats of any sort
119985 where honest and conscientious public servants were not put in impossible situations such as this
119986 if a politician a judge a bishop or any public figure cannot keep their promises to a wife husband etc how can they be trusted to honour pledges to their constituencies and people they serve
119987 this is a bleak deeply flawed anything goes philosophy it is also dangerous and socially undermining devoid of the basic decent moral standards that form the very fabric of our society
119988 set an example of what is good and be rooted in sound moral values
119989 pressures are at work to legitimise any and every lifestyle irrespective of any difference of value and quality between them
119990 the news of the world stole my image and my dignity i feel very strongly that some newspapers literally ruin peoples lives and more has to be done to stop this
119991 actually theyve got a couple of decent beers here although its a pity the fullers is off
119992 but i really dont know where things are headed between me and boyfriend p now that i seem to be boyfriend number 2
119993 you used to encourage him to try and find a permanent boyfriend didnt you
119994 ummm yes thats true actually id forgotten that but that was when i wasnt available as a full time boyfriend and i am now
119995 because boyfriend s hasnt quite moved into his new house yet has he anyway why are you so sure that youre not the boyfriend number 1
119996 the whole way he reacts to the other guy gives me a strong impression that im the 2nd choice for example in an unguarded moment he let slip that when the other guy was away travelling recently hed sent him a txt msg to say how much he missed him but hes never sends me emails or txt msgs to say that he misses me
119997 most days i guess and i try to phone him at least once a week
119998 well if youre always in touch with him i guess he doesnt get a chance to miss you does he anyway perhaps you seem a bit too needy which is always a turn off
119999 well how about this on our last night in new york together he left me to my own devices because the other guy was in new york too and he wanted to have supper with him instead of me
