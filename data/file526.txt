5260012 not happening google goog and its partners continue to hammer down that android is still launching in q4
5260013 the latest update venturebeat narrows the launch windowdown to half of q4 noting that the first android phone will
5260014 now we know that google isnt building a device of its own that doesnt mean it shouldnt but it is much cooler to call it a google phone than say android which has a certain dweeb ring to it
5260015 it will be made by htc well known for making windows mobile phones it will be called dream it is a smartphone with a full five row keyboard and has a touch screen it will be sold by t mobile no surprise then that its pursuing an apple imitating app store strategy qualcomm is working with five other phone makers
5260016 software is in fact what will make or break this gadget which some call the gphone there have been plenty of touch screen iphone clones already several of them from htc theyve done well but not nearly as well as apples iphone could the android phone change that perhaps
5260017 the tech duo is working on the hotly anticipated mobile software for so called dream phone
5260018 but time is running out since the device will need clearance from the u s federal communications commission a process that typically takes three months last year google goog made a big splash announcing it was setting its sights on the wireless market by the middle of this year the search giant still hopes to make good on that promise but all the pieces arent exactly falling in line

5260020 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5260021 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5260022 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5260023 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5260024 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5260025 there is an urgency for youth to get involved with these things now more than ever to get involved and dedicate themselves to world issues to try to change the world
5260026 everyone brought welcome knowledge that was overwhelmingly encouraging and very informative
5260027 by yourself i find its hard to change but in a group you can come together and make one great event
5260028 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5260029 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5260030 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5260031 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5260032 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

5260035 they want to impeach me now why do they want to do it
5260036 joseph is a great signing for us and im sure that he will help us improve as a team once he is fully fit
5260037 when we first spoke to him it was clear that he was serious about coming here and doing well for us he has very high standards as do we and that can only be a good thing
5260038 he was very interested in what direction we were going how we planned on getting there and what we wanted to achieve going forward he liked what we had to say and we were encouraged by what he said
5260039 by bringing in a player of his skill we are showing people that we are moving forward as a club his experience will be vital for us as we have a very young squad right now
5260040 for now joseph is on loan with us we will review the situation at the end of the season

5260048 once jack starts to tell a story its hard to get him to stop
5260049 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
5260050 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
5260051 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5260052 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
5260053 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
5260054 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
5260055 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all

5260061 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here

5260065 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5260066 get it off the air and i really mean it
5260067 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5260068 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere

5260074 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5260075 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5260076 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5260077 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5260078 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5260079 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5260080 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5260081 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5260082 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5260083 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5260084 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5260085 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5260086 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5260087 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5260088 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5260089 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5260090 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5260091 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5260092 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5260093 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5260111 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5260112 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5260113 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5260114 in such a world of conflict a world of victims and executioners it is the job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners
5260115 the old days of a page with three references and three phone numbers on it that you controlled are over
5260116 with these networking sites youve opened up your rolodex for the whole world to see
5260117 this sales person was on linkedin and he had a contact on there from one of our competitors since everyone knows everyone in this industry we contacted someone there directly
5260118 i just dont know about mixing those two environments in the same place
5260119 there remains an industry problem associated with broad awareness of the availability
5260120 but once you have a trial use by the consumer of this service there is very high customer satisfaction
5260121 we see clinics as an emerging industry and we expect to see continued changes and evolution in that space but i can tell you that we are excited about the strong interest that we are getting from hospitals and health care systems
5260122 the bottom line is that its difficult to first of all get this idea across and make people aware of where these locations are and then finally to feel comfortable to actually get their health care in a retail store

5260148 i dont mind tackling construction like this i have always been more or less inclined to do things myself and actually love it

5260150 i started seeing a lot of these rooms online and i decided when we moved into our new house to have it wired for a projector
5260151 i finally settled on one that was not a 1080p the sanyo plv z5 but youd never know the difference the picture is unbelievable when we watch the eagles concert dvds down there it is like you can reach out and touch the band
5260152 this was more or less my first projector and it gives me an idea of what to look for in the next model things like are the blacks as black as they can be
5260153 the center channel cabinets panels come off and the doors open up
5260154 its all made with speaker cloth so remotes can work through it and the sound can come through without being affected

5260162 we will be appealing to the press council and as soon as we have submitted the copy i will send you a copy
5260163 if we were to leave the ruling then yes i believe it would send a wrong signal and i think it will offer a clear fodder for those who may wish to limit media freedom
5260164 we must re emphasise however our commitment to the process so we will be lodging our appeal early this week and we will take it from there
5260165 we need to be honest about self regulation having its limitations certainly there are effective means of protecting media freedom and at the same time helping to hold media accountable and the mmp fully supports a professional and strong self regulatory system
5260166 the matter might still go on appeal and it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage
5260167 we believe there is a need for a place where the print media can be held accountable for things they say that are absolutely not true
5260168 it is a pity that the ombudsman has failed to rule against the labelling of people as aliens

5260233 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names

5260235 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5260236 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5260237 we created a draft paln and the draft plan was never officiated because of the fact that the barriers went up and we couldnt do a whole lot after the barriers were there

5260240 a war is just if there is no alternative and the resort to arms is legitimate if they represent your last hope

5260281 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5260282 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities
5260283 that gives you an idea of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers

5260298 im sorry to hear that you have to jump back into these waters it must be
5260299 please continue to let me in on your job search my husband has been out
5260300 aaahahahahaha i think its never too late and we should apply together can you even
5260301 hey thanks for the lileks com link where i just spent over an hour scrolling through
5260302 the continuing massive industrialization in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5260303 more than half of all processes between businesses and their social ecological and economic environment are related to procurement
5260304 therefore it is only consistent if a strong environmental orientation is already in place in procurement
5260305 thats atrocious for him trying to sit on the throne at iolani palace
5260306 i somewhat believe that in her own mind the mother has given up some truths in the statements she has made
5260307 it hasnt worked for 30 days so lets try something different
5260308 the most important thing is getting caylee home or finding whats going on in the case
5260309 people look over the old heads basically the fans who are over 25
5260310 people look over them i dont thats my wheelhouse my true fans are probably 10 years younger than me 10 years older than me that world doesnt buy a lot of records now but its my job to get them to check for what im doing
5260311 my record is catering towards the mature hip hop fan
5260312 the kids might be able to get with it but it aint just playing it aint just partying its reality to me this album
5260313 going independent in 2006 really re energized me it rejuvenated me and my feelings for the game
5260314 being on major record labels is for the birds it sucks all your energy out because the good ideas you come up with a lot of times they dont wanna do it especially on the promotional tip they follow these same ancient formulas to sell a record you gotta be creative in 2008 to sell a record thats the first thing when i started doing it independent it gave me my swagger back and made me feel like i was doing hip hop and not just doing records for somebody i just went back to the essence and stopped worrying about the hip hop fans and started worrying about ice cube fans
5260315 i wanna take it back to the real hip hop
5260316 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back by public enemy is one of the records i cherish i love i wanted to flip that and put the emphasis more on us and our community on what were doing to hold us back i also wanted to talk about whats going on in the world and how i feel about it and what im ready to do its not a game people playing hip hop like its a game lets get back to talking about what people going through so we can solve some of these issues
5260317 weve established a good relationship with jeezy because hes also in a movie i wrote called janky promoters
5260318 me and mike epps play two shady rap concert promoters we bring jeezy to town and dont have enough money to pay him we kinda got close doing the movie jeezy was like yo i want you to do a record on my album i was like i want you to do a record on mine we exchanged songs and concepts and made it happen we got a heater on my album called i got my locs on we made it happen
5260319 i had to bring out bun and get everything straight
5260320 we took a gatorade break and got everything straight we can agree to disagree but its all love
5260321 i took a verse off my president is black where i shouted out the whole n o shouted out soulja slim pimp c bg bun i summed everything up
5260322 everybody thought the situation with me and pimp was something else but it really wasnt that before pimp c passed he reached out to me and everything was good i wanted the world to know that rest in peace homie
5260323 murdered it esco went in esco is a cool n a though i cant even front hes a thorough n a he went in on the record i dont know what youre gonna think of it i cant even begin to tell you what he said im just telling you esco went in
5260324 im always in the hood im always in the community
5260325 imma say this and be frank a lot of cats come up from the hood ranks and everybody wanna rep the hood everybody wanna say they did this and that when nas repped me i feel a way im a cat from georgia hes from new york city so if he can respect my gangsta i definitely can respect his and anybody around him thats why i respect new york so much and chi town detroit same thing they respect my gangsta
5260326 the hip hop that im used to was the hip hop that express yourself came out of and fight the power
5260327 when krs was big when the bridge is over was big when it was a dis song but it wasnt a beef song when the nature of hip hop was beautiful no matter what the face of it was that day the outcome was always dope man from the spice 1s to the kool g raps thats what i miss when hip hop evolved and changed and got thrown in a bucket of kool aid somebody threw too much sugar in it now it tastes a little funny thats why i say hip hop broke my heart when i got in i thought it would preserve itself long enough to at least let me see the hip hop i was used to the hip hop i fell in love with but it didnt do that hip hop left the job for me to continue on and still pay homage to the way of old me and hip hop be beefing sometimes but no matter what face hip hop makes im gonna evolve with it
5260328 when youre in the studio with wayne you could pretty much chill man because everything is so easy
5260329 if you go back to little lil wayne to now you can see the dramatic changes hes everywhere what the f can you do besides come behind him i dont ever put nobody before myself i feel im the greatest alive i hold it down but wayne hes got it right now so i dont mind stepping behind for a minute until its my turn when its my turn my albums gonna run his down and well go at it again next time
5260330 we appeal to all media and journalists to cover events objectively until the situation changes we will interfere with the dissemination of false information given by the western georgian government we are not the ones who launched an information war so we are not responsible for its consequences
5260331 you can call us criminals cyber terrorists or war activists but we only fight against any unacceptable aggression against russia in the global network
5260332 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5260333 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5260334 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5260335 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5260336 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5260337 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5260338 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5260339 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5260340 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5260341 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5260342 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5260343 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5260344 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5260345 for a minute there were just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that
5260346 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5260347 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5260348 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5260349 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5260350 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5260351 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5260352 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system
5260353 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5260354 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5260355 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
5260356 a lot of my retirement plan hinges on the deployment cycle and the war on terror as it exists today
5260357 our loss rates are fairly stable and the growth is whats killing us
5260358 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
5260359 there is a much larger percentage of officers planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
5260360 we are overworked because of the shortages and have nothing to look forward to but another rotation to afghanistan or iraq so everything weighs towards getting out
5260361 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
5260362 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now

5260374 the guys with mccain stuff say it isnt selling even if people are going to vote for him they arent going to buy his apparel
5260375 it started during the election between him and the lady
5260376 i was surprised i didnt think there would be a market for it
5260377 you have older people who come and understand the election and you have high school students who are just getting interested
5260378 generally when theres something that people are into the street vendors are going to move on it
5260379 there is unprecedented interest and incredible grass roots energy and activism around this election and that is reflected in the enthusiasm for obama gear
5260380 theres always going to be a market until the election
5260381 but after we win its going to be a whole new product
5260382 ah you know hes got a lot longer track record than that
5260383 hes been doing ah hes a legendary entrepreneur and you know one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5260384 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
5260385 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
5260386 only one instance of a scriptmanager can be added to the page

5260388 completely consistent with his record of supporting our allies in a very tough region of the world
5260389 hes been a leader on this issue for a very long time
5260390 this little country was prospering its a democracy its a freely elected government
5260391 what were seeing now is a gross violation of everything we stand for and believe in
5260392 but this one is really brazen theres been an exchange of money when hes been advising mccain to take some action
5260393 we drove to whaley park and there were signs and balloons and we had players from past years parents fans and people who just wanted to congratulate us
5260394 the kids and i are very appreciative of the support weve received we heard legends had 120 people waiting to get in to see our game saturday morning
5260395 i wanted to come out and let the guys know how proud we are of them and how well they represented long beach
5260396 its an incredible achievement and they should be very proud
5260397 every single player in a long beach uniform played a vital role in us becoming world champions
5260398 of course i am a little frustrated i am not starting but i am very happy to have come through when i was called on
5260399 having the people come out today and waiting for us at the park made us feel like we were professionals
5260400 only one team in the world can claim to be world champions and i feel blessed to be a part of it
5260401 having all those people waiting to see us was so cool it means so much to us that so many supported us
5260402 i didnt hit as well as id have liked but i did everything i could on the field and was happy to be part of something this great
5260403 it was so wonderful to see all the people waiting to honor us
5260404 it was so cool to meet him and we talked manager to manager about their game sunday night and he yeager is a very nice humble man
5260405 he is going to play this season with us i am absolutely sure
5260406 he has looked lively very happy and full of desire and the coach bernd schuster has told me that he is training very well
5260407 he is a player whose club did not want to sell him he said that he would like to play for us but his club did not want to sell him there are a lot of clubs who want our players and we dont want to sell them either this is football
5260408 the feeling is that is this is going to be a good year for real madrid we said that the project was complete and i am sure that this season is going to be one of consolidation we have a complete and very balanced squad
5260409 it seems we dont find out until they walk in the hospital door
5260410 if i as the mayor cross the border it takes me a lot longer than its taking some of these wounded folks clearly some deals have been made at a higher level of government and we didnt know about them
5260411 if i got shot down there do you think id get this kind of an escort id be lucky to come back in a garbage truck
5260412 we dont know whether some of the people being brought here are bad guys or good guys but the history south of the border is that these people hit men will go to the hospital to finish the job if they need to were not equipped to deal with threats like that
5260413 we dont want to leave the russians out in the cold but we want to make it clear to moscow that its no longer going to be business as usual
5260414 a united nations aid convoy entering the georgian town of gori says the buildings there do not appear to be badly damage
5260415 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
5260416 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
5260417 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5260418 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
5260419 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
5260420 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
5260421 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
5260422 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
5260423 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
5260424 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
5260425 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
5260426 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
5260427 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
5260428 what would the united states do if suddenly mexico became an iranian or russian ally theyd crush every last mexican one way or another

5260441 hang on i know something useful about william skakespeare and im going to provide a description of him so that it can be automatically integrated into your metadata if you want

5260443 that person who you say is the dc subject of that book by bill bryson is also the dc creator of these plays
5260444 im still a tottenham player but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5260445 however im now with the national team so i just want to think about the national team
5260446 i still have a lot of friends at tottenham and im not angry about ramos naming me as a substitute people say i looked unhappy but if i was laughing when i was on the bench they would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5260447 i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker can be dimitar berbatov
5260448 there are still two weeks of the transfer window to go but this is the most important week yet
5260449 we went with giovani dos santos instead because we thought his speed would worry middlesbrough
5260450 but as middlesbrough tired we thought it would be the right moment to substitute him and bring on berbatov
5260451 were thinking long term and the aim is to take this club into the champions league
5260452 that is the vision and because we cannot compete financially for the top players the only way we will do that is by giving youngsters an opportunity

5260455 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
5260456 it is scorned worldwide afghanistan is backsliding the bar has been set low in iraq georgia is in ruins
5260457 this action is a real challenge to the idea of building a europe whole free and at peace
5260458 jeopardize these nascent democracies by letting them think that they can put themselves in this kind of situation and survive
5260459 you are not just putting democracy on the line in georgia you are putting all of these places in that neighborhood on the line
5260460 i have seen it over and over again be misconstrued by nations not used to dealing with us
5260461 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything
5260462 that is what happened in hungary in 1956 and in czechoslovakia in 1968
5260463 these guys are animals if they saw a female dog they would harass it
5260464 i think a woman who wears hijab can be more provocative to them
5260465 the more covered up you are the more interesting you are to them

5260483 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5260484 kami mengkhawatirkan hal itu akan terjadi lagi mengingat jenis tanah di desa kami terlalu labil
5260485 kami minta semua warga waspada sewaktu waktu terjadi hujan lebat mereka diminta segera mengungsi ke tetangga sekitar yang lebih aman
5260486 jika terjadi hujan deras warga memang khawatir akan terjadi longsor apalagi retakan tanah mulai bermunculan
5260487 whatever ive got in my career now i would have had a great deal more if id played in los angeles or chicago you name a town somewhere they were just grateful to have me around
5260488 we are reorganising our styrenics business to improve its future success and give us new options outside of basf
5260489 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5260490 nothing i went out there pretended like i was talking but i wasnt i said nothing i was just trying to get his mind of the runners and back on me
5260491 there are some places where the russians are not interacting at all where they are aggressive touchy almost ready to engage in a firefight with the georgians and there are other places where on the contrary they appear quite friendly
5260492 i was in the small georgian town of kaspi where there were several places in the town where the russians had taken up positions with tanks and armored personnel carriers and their soldiers were wandering around freely now some of them were ossetian as well and they were interacting quite happily with the local population chatting with them discussing the issues discussing whether it was right for them to be there at all in the first place
5260493 the growing suspicion is that ethnic cleansing is still going on and on august 17 i met a french correspondent who had been in the area of akol gori which is part of georgia proper northwest of tbilisi by about 35 kilometers and just a few kilometers from the south ossetian border and which is the new point or relocation for russian troops
5260494 and there were hundreds of ossetian irregulars marauding through georgian villages there
5260495 there are stories of murders rapes burning of houses thefts of property driving off of cattle and kidnapping
5260496 human rights watch which is the only independent human rights organization so far to get into the area has confirmed many of those reports
5260497 we saw those people working in the city cleaning up debris after the bombings we were told by representatives of the authorities unofficially that those people were indeed detained and that they were hauling debris in the city voluntarily
5260498 understandably we were not able to speak to any of those people to our regret
5260499 but i think it is very important today to clarify their status whether they are detained civilians or prisoners of war
5260500 in some villages as many as 90 percent of the homes looked ruined

5260516 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5260517 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behaviour characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5260518 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5260519 maar dat is niet het enige het gaat ook om het type website waarop de column is geplaatst als dat een platform is dat vol staat met dergelijke bedreigingen wordt de waarschijnlijkheid groter dat het niet om een grap gaat
5260520 je kunt ook op internet mompelen dat alle politici dood moeten niemand verwacht dan een reeks van aanslagen op het binnenhof maar dit was een persoonlijk gekleurde oproep om iets bij haar huis te doen elke relativering ontbrak
5260521 iedereen kan achter haar aanlopen om te zien waar ze daadwerkelijk woont justitie heeft hier een zaak die ze daadwerkelijk kan doorzetten
5260522 formeel moeten wij handelen als het strafbare feit gepleegd is er is pas sprake van smaad als de rechter daarover geoordeeld heeft niet als de advocaat van de tegenpartij met veel bombarie om verwijdering van onwelgevallige teksten vraagt
5260523 die is niet in eerste instantie verantwoordelijk voor het gedrag van zijn gasten maar in de praktijk komt het steeds vaker voor dat providers al van tevoren handelen dat heeft ook te maken met de internationale context smaad bijvoorbeeld wordt in veel landen ook binnen europa strafrechtelijk verschillend gedefinieerd providers nemen geen risico ze zijn het juridische afvoerputje van nederland
5260524 we want to make sure that residents and small businesses in bronzeville are not displaced as a result of this project
5260525 i dont think its fair to say we are totally against this project but we are opposed to the way the city has went about informing the community on it and the potential displacement it could cause
5260526 the hospital is not due to close until december and already the city of chicago has hammered out a deal with the land owner for 85 million
5260527 this puts pressure on the hospital to hurry up and move and scares off potential investors who may were considering lending a hand
5260528 i am afraid that if the city wins their olympic bid it would displace many of us poor black folks
5260529 my building is three blocks from the olympic village site and i cant see the city spending all that money to build the darn thing knowing that welfare folks live a few blocks away
5260530 we have owned that complex for some years now and are not looking to sell or redevelop it into condos
5260531 many of the tenants there have lived there for years so they are like family to us and east lake treats its family well
5260532 i am on a fixed income and i cannot afford to go nowhere else i have lived here for 20 years and if the olympic village causes me to move i do not know where i could go and still be close to the lake and have good public transportation
5260533 whether i win or lose the nation will lose the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5260534 yes yes im so sorry im so so sorry but every word is true god knows i dont want it to be true but i just cant help myself

5260547 oh harry how i wish i had met you five years ago
5260548 i admit my husband has never made me feel as i feel right now never not even remotely he never has and he never could hes not in your league as a man harry just an ordinary guy but hes been good to me over the years a provider as much as he could be at least and loving and considerate and faithful i couldnt cheat on him i just couldnt it would be wrong and it would crush him
5260549 if i were married to you and didnt fuck you more than twice in a single day you could figure there must be something wrong with me
5260550 it isnt fair youve never seen my husband but you know perfectly well that he cant compete with you as a physical specimen what 35 year old man could you know damned well that there are twenty year old athletes whod sell their souls for a body as firm and lithe as yours

5260559 akhils elder brother shailender who lives in gurgaon and his two sisters sushma and pushpa who are settled in up have also been praying for his success at the beijing olympics
5260560 apart from relatives everybody in his friend circle has been praying
5260561 it is a welcome development for the people of pakistan who have been fighting for the restoration of democratic and civilian rule in the country
5260562 if there is any apprehension among some sections in the high echelons of power in new delhi about a political vacuum in pakistan it is unwarranted and incorrect
5260563 after reviewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies and on their advice i have decided to resign
5260564 realistic decision in view of the way things were unfolding
5260565 the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed
5260566 i am sure they would assess the speech of musharraf the consequences and repercussions and they would also keep in mind the political developments in the country and reach a decision
5260567 i am sure it will be someone from the ppp
5260568 it is a victory of democratic forces today the shadow of dictatorship that prevailed for long over this country has been removed
5260569 no impeachment or no chargesheet can stand against me nothing can be proved against me this much confidence i have in me but i think this is not the time for individual bravado this is the time for serious thought
5260570 in the interest of the country i have decided to resign the resignation will reach the national assembly speaker shortly
5260571 now they want to impeach me are they afraid of my constitutional powers impeachment and chargesheet is parliaments right to give a reply is my right
5260572 no chargesheet can stand against me no charge can be proved against me i have this much confident in myself because i have not done anything for myself whatever i have done i have done for pakistan its people whatever the chargesheet i have no fear
5260573 but questions arise as to what impact the impeachment will have on the country whether the country will descend into further instability and confrontation whether the office of presidency should come under pressure should it come under impeachment procedure
5260574 upward pressure on inflation is likely to continue throughout the year largely due to rising food prices and elevated oil prices the indian government recently raised retail fuel prices by around 10 per cent and we expect there is more to come
5260575 we believe wpi inflation will remain in double digit territory until may 2009 we expect wpi inflation of 17 per cent by september 2008

5260585 the prevailing wisdom 18 months or so ago was that invading iraq had been in retrospect a disastrous blunder but what if we had known then what we know
5260586 any shift to the east or west would lessen our chances of getting rain
5260587 wed still get some rain but it depends on how far it shifts
5260588 stream flows and groundwater are much lower this year than last this year its starting much earlier
5260589 we would almost have to have a repeat of the fall of 2004 to have a hope to get back to normal and that was an exceedingly rare event
5260590 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the plo
5260591 was awarded an extraordinary capability for the direction of italian intelligence agencies and special forces after he received approval for the deal
5260592 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5260593 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry
5260594 with the palestinians we get along in a different manner
5260595 only the palestinians can serve as mediators with the red brigades

5260649 the bad eggs among my men do collaborate with some of the drug barons and so do everything possible to pervert the course of justice by arranging to remove the seized substances that would have been used as exhibits at the courts against the suspects
5260650 you cannot believe it but it is true and not allegations that seized substances do get missing in my exhibit rooms across the country but we are doing everything possible to curb the trend so that the drugs war will be won by all of us included
5260651 this will be a continuous exercise until such a time that majority if not all the bad eggs were removed so that the operations of the agency will be smooth and effective
5260652 tonight were going to have sex and you are welcome to watch after we fuck we plan to send you out of the room and well spend the rest of tonight and all of tomorrow together without you once is all you were promised but we realized last night that its so messy when we fuck that we really needed a clean up man so if you want to be our clean up man youll be welcome to watch whatever we do for the rest of the weekend
5260653 i told james how you like to lick my lovers cum out of my pussy after i get fucked and he said hed really like to see that happen
5260654 its really the least you could do for him he made me feel so good last night and i know you want to thank him dont you

5260656 come on cuckold its time for you to watch me fuck your wife
5260657 i love swimming and i love jasons performances tell him that i wish him all the best in the final
5260658 we were not given any funds to prepare the team either by the national olympic committee of kenya nock or the government the aba officials had to use their personal money to put the squad in residential camp in ruiru
5260659 we have very many non athletes in beijing and if nock could cut the number and use that money on the preparation of the team i believe we would have got better results
5260660 whenever we approached the government for assistance we were told to go and look for sponsorship we have approached many companies but no one is ready to put his money on boxing it is a poor mans sport
5260661 i blame the aba for the poor show they should have appointed former boxing stars like phillip waruinge steve thiga and sammy mbugua among others on the technical bench
5260662 just thought i would ring to see how you are
5260663 these white people sit in the sun trying to make their skins brown
5260664 but we look like that already you see how lucky you are
5260665 of sitting around in a house somewhere abroad when that is all i do here in luton
5260666 i see like everything else in the world it is one mans work

5260682 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5260683 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5260684 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5260685 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5260686 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5260687 between 2003 and 2007 in the local government system constituency development project funds were paid directly to selected councillors cheque were issued in the names of elected chairmen and councillors to executive constituency development projects as against the role
5260688 a total sum of n995 million was paid directly to all the 332 councillors as constituency development project fund against financial regulations
5260689 by simple arithmetic n30 million monthly for 12 month is n360m we believe this is a fraud and we implore your commission to investigate this deduction
5260690 there is not a lot to say the european commission considers the resignation of pakistan president musharraf as essentially a matter of internal politics in pakistan

5260692 when youre competitive you want to win every down and thats a good thing nolan said

5260700 to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5260701 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5260702 in this context the musharraf years yielded significant dividends notably in the economic field but also until last autumn in areas like media freedom
5260703 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5260704 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5260705 we will also continue to deepen our security co operation with the new government and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan
5260706 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5260707 there has been a deepening of uk pakistan relations we wish him mr musharraf well in the future
5260708 our relations are not dependent on one individual we support any measures which support democracy and the rule of law
5260709 i think it is the right thing for him to have done
5260710 i think it in no way detracts from the strong record he has as being a staunch ally of the west and its fight against islamic terrorism
5260711 i think the coalition government in pakistan now needs to focus on two issues the parlous economic state of the country and working with its allies to combat the ongoing threat of regional terrorism
5260712 i welcome the fact that this is the culmination of the restoration of democracy in pakistan

5260718 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5260719 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could

5260784 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5260785 how do you go from where you are to where you want to be i think you have to have an enthusiasm for life you have to have a dream a goal and you have to be willing to work for it
5260786 people want to be on a team they want to be part of something bigger than themselves they want to be in a situation where they feel that they are doing something for the greater good
5260787 the spirit the will to win and the will to excel are the things that endure these qualities are so much more important than the events that occur
5260788 on a good team there are no superstars there are great players who show they are great players by being able to play with others as a team they have the ability to be superstars but if they fit into a good team they make sacrifices they do things necessary to help the team win
5260789 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather is a lack of will
5260790 the will to win is important but the will to prepare is vital
5260791 you cant get much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel good
5260792 discipline is doing what has to be done when it has to be done as well as it can be done and doing it that way all the time
5260793 success isnt something that just happens success is learned success is practiced and then it is shared
5260794 win or lose you will never regret working hard making sacrifices being disciplined or focusing too much success is measured by what we have done to prepare for competition
5260795 dont let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do
5260796 if youre not making mistakes then youre not doing anything im positive that a doer makes mistakes

5260810 it was a bloody tricky day we were fully concentrated and were quite stressed

5260816 for in it the righteousness of god is revealed through faith for faith as it is written he who through faith is righteous shall live
5260817 see he is puffed up his desires are not upright but the righteous will live by his faith 5 indeed wine betrays him he is arrogant and never at rest because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples niv 4 behold he whose soul is not upright in him shall fail but the righteous shall live by his faith 5 moreover wine is treacherous the arrogant man shall not abide his greed is as wide as sheol like death he has never enough he gathers for himself all nations and collects as his own all peoples

5260828 joseph is a great signing for us and im sure that he will help us improve as a team once he is fully fit

5260830 he was very interested in what direction we were going how we planned on getting there and what we wanted to achieve going forward he liked what we had to say and we were encouraged by what he said

5260864 to just prove itself innocent pakistan is falsely blaming india it is clear that pakistan is behind all he terrorist activities in india

5260898 but though the handling of the kart was spot on all the way through we still couldnt quite find the right set up
5260899 in the third heat i had a bit of a disaster off the start line
5260900 i dont know if it was me or the clutch or what but the kart just bogged down and left me in about sixth position i managed to come back through to second place though
5260901 overall the results were good but the chassis just didnt feel right it felt like i was on a knife edge all the way round the circuit
5260902 mariembourg isnt a bad circuit for overtaking the problem just seems to be with that specific tyre which is used in the championship
5260903 i was only sixth or seventh fastest in the heats on old tyres but because i had started at the front i was able to stay there for the finals everyone was back on new tyres again though so i was fairly confident i could still win
5260904 i got into the first corner and got a bump from behind
5260905 the same thing happened in the second and third corners too and as i came out of the third one mathias gallepe came alongside and deliberately drove into the side of me so that his energy corse team mate tony lavanant could win the race
5260906 as soon as the race started it became clear he wanted me off the circuit the kart was completely totalled with front end damage to the track rod and steering column in particular i was mightily angry but in the end i just had to calm myself down and get on with concentrating on the next race
5260907 i got a decent start in the second final and was up to 26th by the first half of lap one but then someone spun in front of me and i went the wrong way and had to take to the grass in avoidance to stop him from going into me
5260908 that in itself was a bit annoying because just one more place would have meant i got a point but then i guess on a weekend like that one point or nothing doesnt really make much difference really my pace was really good if i had started near the front i would have had a strong chance of winning
5260909 a top three position in the championship is certainly still possible
5260910 that would be nice and we know we are going to be quick around varennes and that the kart should work well there we have to go there aiming to win both races and im very confident we can do just that
5260911 if i hadnt got the ten second jump start penalty at angerville or had the crash at mariembourg and had instead collected those points that got away i basically could have driven around in the last meeting with my feet up in the air
5260912 these things happen though and overall for my first year in the europeans i dont think its been a bad year at all it seems i have no luck whatsoever at mariembourg and i left there with a feeling of real disappointment but when i got back home i just put it behind me and focussed on getting my revenge on the track in the wsk
5260913 but then we had a really bad practice we were so far off the pace 1 5 seconds it was unbelievable there were problems with the chassis problems with the engine problems with everything you could think of
5260914 we changed a lot of things for qualifying and that seemed to make a bit of a difference as i lined up 31st after that we kept working on both the chassis and engine and managed to make the kart feel a lot better in time for the heats
5260915 i dropped a wheel onto the grass and just threw myself off the road
5260916 i was coming through again and was up to tenth and could probably have finished sixth or seventh but we all make mistakes sometimes dont we we worked out that cost me tenth on the grid for the pre final instead of which i ended up starting 22nd
5260917 then before the pre final we changed the cylinder head on the engine because it had looked like it was about to seize we decided to play cautiously with that but unfortunately the new cylinder barrel had a problem and we were really slow finishing 18th
5260918 for the final we therefore threw caution to the wind and put the old barrel back on and just went for it
5260919 if i had started towards the front though for sure i would have been battling for a position inside the top five outright which is where we want to be at the moment it was certainly frustrating not to have been able to do that but just look at the people we overtook to come through the field francesco laudato all but one of the birel factory drivers jorrit pex lavanant drivers who have the capability of being up in the top two or three it was particularly good to beat pex that was a nice revenge for having just lost out to him in the 2006 world finals
5260920 to have had top five pace was very encouraging ahead of the last round
5260921 and when we get a bit of luck going our way we can certainly finish up there too thats what im aiming for at zuera if not even a little bit higher
5260922 i doubt we can win the final round of the wsk but when youre not fighting for the championship anymore of course you can just throw caution to the wind and go all out
5260923 the equipment feels good i feel good and i know that together we can fight really hard i want to bounce back from the disappointment weve had recently and prove im one of the best in the world

5260928 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5260929 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5260930 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5260931 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system
5260932 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5260933 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5260934 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5260935 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5260936 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5260937 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5260938 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
5260939 as the pace of residential development is growing and accelerating their increase in the parking supply will unleash a torrent of unnecessary car ownership
5260940 it would definitely have an effect on marketability and property values
5260941 apartments without a parking space are considerably less valuable than ones that offer a space
5260942 limiting the number of parking spaces in residential developments does not necessarily result in fewer cars on the street or fewer vehicle miles traveled

5260962 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20m hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5260963 nor is it limited to the countries and cities with the lowest gdp it is prevalent in many mid income countries as well
5260964 as long as developing countries lack suitable transport to deliver large quantities of perishable produce to urban areas urban agriculture will remain important in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use polluted water

5260969 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5260970 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5260971 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5260972 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5260973 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5260974 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5260975 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5260976 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5260977 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5260978 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5260979 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5260980 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5260981 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5260982 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5260983 rfid offers adopters of the technology a number of benefits from improvements in manufacturing inventory and distribution processes to reduced costs for product theft spoilage or obsolescence
5260984 its incumbent on our industry with help from organizations such as comptia to help customers overcome any obstacles to rfid usage and help them benefit from the efficiencies rfid can deliver
5260985 in the market rfid has come to refer to inventory tracking where nfc is more specific to person transactions a key difference between rfid and nfc protocols are the way in which the master slave relationship is handled
5260986 not only does nfc have a much shorter transmission range than rfid inherently making it more secure than traditional rfid but applications running over nfc technologies will more than likely encrypt the data that is being transmitted so even if there is a sniffer trying to pick up the transmission it wont pick up anything of use because of the encryption
5260987 security is something you dont just have with a purchased product you have to keep working on it every day this area needs a certain level of education on what it is and how it works in the wireless world the big challenge is how the rfid device integrates with security measures
5260988 there is no difference whether the use is short or long distance what matters more are other factors that affect security
5260989 there are multiple points with the hardware and software that allow the possibility of a breach
5260990 some vendors say im compliant today so i am ok but that is not true
5260991 rfid users need monitoring of the network this didnt exist before hardware and software vendors all have their own offerings the challenge is how to make it all work together this is the crux of what is happening
5260992 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5260993 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5260994 in the context of the longer term growth the demand challenges that the world will deliver and the supply challenges that i have described the combination of bhp billiton and rio makes more sense than ever
5260995 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5260996 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies

5260998 narrative of the night on which the murder took place
5260999 had a violent disposition or was dealing drugs or there was any connection between the two
5261000 the impugned statements carried the implication that the trial judge took from them they invited the jury to conclude that the deceased was a drug dealer and as such had a propensity for violence and was more likely to be the agressor
5261001 the cumulative effect of the admission of the 39 pills evidence the exclusion of evidence of the respondents propensity for violence the defence counsels impermissible use of the evidence and the trial judges failure to take corrective action left the jury with a distorted factural picture on the key issue

5261004 our 4 school uniform and further price cuts to stationery grocery and petrol are helping households to cope with their budgets but schools have to stop restricting families from shopping around for the best value on things such uniforms and sports kits
5261005 uniforms can help to develop the right mindset among pupils instilling pride and supporting positive behaviour and discipline but its vital this doesnt discriminate against anyone so school uniforms must be reasonably priced we are clear that schools should ensure uniforms are affordable and im pleased that retailers are helping to make this happen

5261008 polly is an expert in identifying opportunities to accelerate brand growth by listening to consumers she brings with her a proven ability to strengthen and grow brands through strong strategic thinking and branded communications with consumers to say that we are thrilled to have her on our team is an understatement
5261009 we are encouraged by our results and our continued market share gains but the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
5261010 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5261011 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer
5261012 the evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children
5261013 it appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips
5261014 the crown would say that this collection of indecent photographs and the subsequent police investigation revealed that this defendant has been involved in the distribution of these photographs for the last four or five years

5261044 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
5261045 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position

5261068 i usually dont pick the same team more than two or three times a year at the most
5261069 but i knew by october what was going to happen with alabama sheridan said he got a similar feeling when arkansas was made a double digit underdog prior to playing at no 1 lsu last season
5261070 that was one of my strongest picks of the year
5261071 if he were to win five or six games this year i think that would be outstanding
5261072 if he were to win seven games id probably vote him coach of the year in the conference

5261074 os bancos estavam com outra din mica de capta o at 2007 menos dependentes dos cdbs um dos problemas para eles foi o compuls rio sobre o leasing que passou a comprometer parte dos recursos captados nesse segmento com isso passaram nos ltimos meses a oferecer taxas melhores para que os cdbs atra ssem mais aplicadores e conseguissem assim captar mais recursos
5261075 tudo depende do volume que se tem para aplicar e do banco que o cliente buscar mas de um modo geral fato que a remunera o subiu nos cdbs

5261100 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
5261101 the price in the federal reserve is about 2 plus percent in the capital markets its four times as high
5261102 if they pay the higher price there is no profitability for them so their franchises are jeopardised this is a serious developing issue as we cure years of overleveraging

5261120 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5261121 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5261122 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5261123 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5261142 the fact that judge taylor sits on the board of a group that gives money to the plaintiff for an otherwise unrelated endeavor would not in my mind raise reasonable questions about her partiality on the issue of warrantless wiretapping

5261182 unfortunately not only did councilwoman schipske vote against a plausible long term solution to the problem of accommodation
5261183 but at various meetings with the fire association and again at the community meeting councilwoman schipske suggested that the female firefighters file a grievance through the association and or a lawsuit against the city as the most effective solution to the problem
5261184 i asked if they had filed a grievance regarding working conditions and they said they had not
5261185 i asked if they were considering litigation against the city they said the women were very angry but loved their jobs and didnt want to sue the city
5261186 i asked the questions to determine whether or not the association had taken any actions on behalf of their members concerning problems with working conditions and if they had whether or not management had responded
5261187 theres nothing i can say that would refute what she says was the intent of her comments
5261188 if it was not her intent to move us forward and file a lawsuit thats probably better in this department in this union nobody wants to go down that road
5261189 the response i received was that it was getting so serious that it was leading to that which is why i made the public comment in city council that a locker room was cheaper than a lawsuit
5261190 basic human dignity provided to each and every other employee of the city of long beach
5261191 we want everybody in the lbfd to feel like they are working in a productive working environment
5261192 this mayor and this city manager are the only people who have moved forward on a plan that is viable
5261193 this definitely concerns us and we are going to meet with the lbfa and respond as best we can
5261194 the department has made numerous presentations to the city council regarding the condition of our fire stations

5261197 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender

5261209 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5261210 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5261211 in the context of the longer term growth the demand challenges that the world will deliver and the supply challenges that i have described the combination of bhp billiton and rio makes more sense than ever
5261212 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5261213 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies

5261223 the generals arent saying what theyre going to do the soldiers say theyre waiting for orders
5261224 well i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop they didnt
5261225 this time i hope he means it you know the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces
5261226 and it helps to bring more awareness to the canal era
5261227 it is nice to be out here amongst all these beauties from the community

5261237 theyve talked about domination as a reason softball is off the olympic program
5261238 isnt that what this is about why do people praise michael phelps for winning eight gold medals but then they put us down and say that we should lose games that doesnt make sense to me
5261239 the olympics is about what theyre doing with michael right now like yes go for the record kick butt i feel like people should be praising us for what were doing and not telling us to lose

5261258 i wanted flexibility and an in principle understanding that the date could be reviewed if fiji for good reason was not able to meet the particular date
5261259 at the presidents dialogue forum we should agree to change the electoral system legally and constitutionally
5261260 that is why i have said that the most practical date for the new system cannot possibly be march 2009 it all depends on the soonest we can reach consensus on the implementation of the new electoral system at the presidents dialogue forum
5261261 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in out national interest in the short and the long term
5261262 outsiders can not decide this for us what we need from the forum and our other international development partners is understanding and support

5261264 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5261265 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5261266 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5261267 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
5261268 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks
5261269 at the moment both teams are even especially as their drivers do sometimes make mistakes although massa was doing a perfect job in budapest but this did not help him because of his cars engine failure
5261270 up until now it has been massa and hamilton because raikkonens performance has been going up and down all the time
5261271 this will be automatically resolved at some point but for the moment massa has the edge over raikkonen from the drivers point of view
5261272 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive
5261273 the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually
5261274 it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
5261275 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5261276 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes
5261277 certainly for a team like us we would be looking at that
5261278 youve got the walls and the difficult of getting cars away so theres going to be a lot of safety cars
5261279 we may look at strategies that will put us out of sync with the others so we can take advantage of it
5261280 with strategy youve got to see what the circuit is like and how the tyres perform because that might dictate far more what we do but its something we will factor into our race strategy
5261281 unfortunately these days with the safety car rule that street races can sometimes be affected by performance isnt shown
5261282 but if youre having a shit weekend it could help you
5261283 thats the biggest concern going into these sort of races that if youre having a good weekend the safety car can completely screw you
5261284 there is not in the world a kind of life more sweet and delightful than of a continual conversation with god

5261305 i believe mechanic lannerd is an incompetent and untrustworthy mechanic who has put the lives of every pilot at risk in this unit with his deceptions and inability to follow faa regulations on the proper maintenance of aircraft in his care
5261306 it is my belief that lt williams had to be aware of robert lannerds poor job performance
5261307 he either chose to look the other way or sanctioned his poor performance hoping that our unit could continue to limp along
5261308 all of them recognized the threat and all of them fired at the same time so it kind of makes you want to think it was a legitimate threat

5261318 at the moment they have limited seating on that side of the station and virtually no other facilities

5261320 the heart of paris is like nothing so much as the unending interior of a house buildings become furniture courtyards become carpets and arrases the streets are like galleries the boulevards conservatories it is a house one or two centuries old rich bourgeois distinguished the only way of going out or shutting the door behind you is to leave the centre

5261343 whats stifled demand until now is not poverty its economics the prices are simply far too high
5261344 for the first time people in the region will have an on ramp on to the global internet highway

5261346 adopting and adapting product best practices across general motors engineering six years later
5261347 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5261348 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5261349 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5261350 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5261351 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5261352 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5261353 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5261354 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5261355 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5261356 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5261357 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5261358 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5261359 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5261360 i feel that there is some humanity in that woman that would not allow her to kill that cute little girl
5261361 i somewhat believe that in her own mind the mother has given up some truths in the statements she has made
5261362 it hasnt worked for 30 days so lets try something different
5261363 the most important thing is getting caylee home or finding whats going on in the case
5261364 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5261365 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5261366 we need this inclusive government to drive the process of addressing those challenges
5261367 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5261368 one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5261369 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5261370 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5261371 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5261372 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5261373 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5261374 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5261375 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5261376 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5261377 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5261378 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5261379 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5261380 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5261381 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5261382 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5261383 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5261384 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5261385 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5261386 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5261387 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5261388 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5261389 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5261390 there seems to be complete market failure as our subscribers are denied advanced value added services in contrast to world scenario where such internet based services are very popular
5261391 i love him unconditionally i love him for who he is
5261392 hold up a frickin second here ill be damned if i throw away my life pining after someone who doesnt want me or doesnt want to present and accountable for a relationship i respect myself far too much to live a half life or allow a man to continue to disregard me i am hurting but i need to get on with my life
5261393 im not just going to say i want life to be different i am going to act different because i want my actions to match my words
5261394 whenever the enemy can be discovered they are to be closed with and attacked with all the vigor which is possible everyone should act with cordial unanimity and the greatest cheerfulness i rely with confidence on the judgement and support of every individual under my command something must be left to chance nothing is sure in a sea fight but in case signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy the entire management of the lee line the division headed by admiral collingwood after the intentions of the commander in chief are signified is intended to be left to the judgement of the admiral commanding that line
5261395 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
5261396 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
5261397 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
5261398 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
5261399 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose
5261400 obviously because canadians are such high users of voice its a pretty good indicator that we do like to talk
5261401 voice and text are certainly very popular because you know what theyre forms of communication and thats what people want to do

5261411 the found photos started earlier this year while using a filesharing program i was searching through someones shared file list and saw a folder named pictures peer to peer software like kazaa dc soulseek winmx bearshare limewire and many others allow you to download
5261412 when you look at what happened in minnesota people are citing it all over in the country as a reason to invest more in infrastructure and i think we need to do that we are going to be having a hearing right when i get back in september over a bill that i have in the senate that congressman oberstar has in the house to make sure that bridge funds are used appropriately to repair and inspect our bridges
5261413 the stock market may demand a higher price assuming that mitsubishi ufj desperately needs full control of the subsidiary for its broader u s expansion strategy
5261414 details of mitsubishi ufjs agreement with unionbancals committee are not available and even if the committee has approved the new tender it does not have power over minority shareholders
5261415 look at what those asian people did how can we ever trust them on anything
5261416 i dont get up when i wake up its around noon if i dont have anything special to do i sleep as long as im tired
5261417 im never in a bad mood or cranky in the mornings i just dont wake up if im not interested in getting up
5261418 its not a question of needing a certain amount of sleep i sleep as long as im tired
5261419 its not my style to show a lot of emotion after winning a race
5261420 winning feels good but im not the type to jump up and down and rub it in everyones face
5261421 winning the world championship last year is the best thing that has ever happened in my career
5261422 and the way it happened overturning a 17 point deficit in the last two races to pip hamilton made it even sweeter
5261423 but i have no desire to overtake michael schumachers number of world titles no way
5261424 thats far too much of a long term project im satisfied with what i have achieved and what lies ahead is a bonus
5261425 i dont need to do that kind of stuff marketing f1 is not my job
5261426 i drive and theres enough of a challenge in that for me
5261427 im not remotely interested in lewismania if there is such a thing ask him how he feels

5261429 all political parties all right thinking people must work together to bring the situation under control
5261430 the meeting will achieve good success in resolving the problem step by step
5261431 i think that at the meeting today and tomorrow we will achieve the total withdrawal of the troops at the pagoda and around the pagoda so the problem will be settled
5261432 its only natural to seek an arrest warrant as weve determined that a crime was committed
5261433 regardless of the differences of opinion it is unacceptable that those involved in whaling get injured or have their lives put in danger
5261434 yet again the russian president has given his word and i hope this time he will honor it
5261435 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters
5261436 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past and we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward
5261437 and that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward

5261441 i had to throw kaboul in to play in midfield and obviously he found it difficult
5261442 i had to play the lad in midfield and he had not had a pre season game i brought kaboul in to play centre back but i lost pedro on thursday not that i wanted to but we needed to get some money back in
5261443 we really had to play two games because after a superb first half we went in at 1 1 and then had to do it all again after the break
5261444 i was very pleased with the performance and although there are areas we must still improve we played some fantastic football

5261446 the ministry of planning has custody of the recent increase of salaries of staff
5261447 we did not object to the salaries of staff for the suffering of our non employee but we fear that this will be an increase in inflation and thus get them on something employee during the period ahead
5261448 the ministry of planning adopts the principle of moving the production process in the state to remedy the cause of inflation the central bank adopts with the ministry of finance and monetary entrance to treat it
5261449 the ministry of planning focuses on investment projects and to recycle the wheel productivity in the state to curb inflation while seeking the central bank and ministry of finance to raise interest rates
5261450 the two will conduct a spot can not be a radical remedy to the reality inflation in iraq

5261520 perjudica a las personas m s d biles econ micamente
5261521 aunque la edad de la mujer receptora es uno de los factores que condicionan la probabilidad de la gestaci n por medio de la fiv esta t cnica est en constante cambio y los avances que se han producido en los ltimos a os se han traducido en un aumento de las tasas de xito terap utico m s all
5261522 resulta significativo que la gu a de recomendaciones en reproducci n asistida elaborada en 2007 por la mutualidad general de funcionarios civiles del estado muface a partir de pautas facilitadas por prestigiosos profesionales de la sanidad p blica y privada establece que la edad l mite de la mujer para realizar la estimulaci n ov rica y aplicar las t cnicas de inseminaci n artificial son 42 a os y la edad m xima recomendada es de 46 a os para acceder a la t cnica de fecundaci n in vitro con donaci n de ovocitos y preembriones as como para la transferencia de preembriones congelados sobrantes de ciclos fiv autorizados
5261523 la mayor capacidad financiera del sistema los cambios sociales producidos en los ltimos a os al ser tambi n notorios hechos como el crecimiento de la tasa de infertilidad el retraso del momento elegido por las mujeres para ser madres la creciente demanda de esta t cnica y su concentraci n en personas cada vez m s mayores as como las propias sentencias del sistema que determinan que entre la primera cita por problemas de fertilidad y la fecha programada para la aplicaci n de la t cnica puedan transcurrir varios a os
5261524 supone la aplicaci n autom tica y no personalizada de un tope de edad que puede llevar a situaciones de frustraci n de las expectativas creadas por el sistema y de denegaci n de la prestaci n legalmente reconocida totalmente injustificadas
5261525 existe una indicaci n facultativa para ese tratamiento por parte del servicio de ginecolog a del hospital de txagorritxu dependiente de osakidetza lo que presupone la existencia de posibilidades razonables de xito
5261526 este organismo no puede denegarlo por el mero hecho de que la interesada tuviera 41 a os cumplidos
5261527 y el documento elaborado por el jefe de la unidad de reproducci n asistida del hospital de cruces carece de fuerza vinculante
5261528 su indicaci n y aplicaci n deber realizarse a la vista de las concretas circunstancias personales m dicas biol gicas y psicol gicas concurrentes en cada caso incluida la edad de la candidata y sus valores hormonales que permitir n determinar las posibilidades de xito y los eventuales riesgos para la solicitante y el feto
5261529 es razonablemente efectiva para la aplicaci n de dicha t cnica
5261530 adem s de carecer de base legal y suponer una diferencia de trato por raz n de la edad que no aparece debidamente justificada ni en la forma ni en el fondo perjudica en mayor medida a las personas m s d biles econ micamente que carecen de medios para costearse el tratamiento en medicina privada

5261537 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5261544 heath riesce a prendere quelle battute e avendo una certa libert di interpretazione le mette al posto giusto e penso che questo si rifletta anche nel modo in cui sono state girate le sue scene

5261546 adorava questo joker era una sorta di figlio per lui ci teneva tantissimo prendeva decisioni ci ragionava molto e lo creava insomma ci ha messo la sua impronta era divertente perch ero nella sua stessa roulotte mentre gli mettevano il makeup quindi passavamo del tempo assieme e potevamo scherzare sul suo trucco lui faceva delle facce e dei versi
5261547 capii suito che stava facendo qualcosa di inusuale e raro e molto speciale anche per un attore con molto talento ed esperienza la cosa veramente incredibile che riusciva a trasmettere questa cosa in chiunque gli stesse intorno sebbene la scena che abbiamo girato assieme fosse molto spaventosa e piena di tensione fu anche molto divertente perch lui prendeva con s qualsiasi input gli lanciassi e io facevo lo stesso
5261548 seppe da subito che doveva diventare una icona in questo ruolo ma non perse mai di vista il realismo di esso interpreta un personaggio umano e la forma del maligno che c in joker una forma molto umana penso che sia importante che voi crediate a lui come si crede a un essere umano e allo stesso a un mostro
5261549 la troupe era elettrizzata da heath e non capita spesso
5261550 pensi a persone come jack nicholson in qualcuno vol sul nido del cuculo o al pacino in quel pomeriggio di un giorno da cani ci sono alcune performance che sono semplicemente senza tempo e nel vederle pensi che gli attori stiano volando heath ha fatto qualcosa di simile sapevo che sarebbe stato qualcosa di speciale sin dal primo giorno che lavorai con lui chiamai degli amici e questi mi chiesero come va e risposi bene tutto bene mi chiesero e heath com nel ruolo di joker e io risposi sar sensazionale possiamo dirlo gi adesso quanto venuto bene alla fine oltre le mie aspettative davvero
5261551 vedere la sua dedizione nella prima scena che girammo assieme heath cielo si era beccato alcune botte mica da ridere e sbucciature ma si stava divertendo come un pazzo adorava quel ruolo me ne chiedeva ancora le pareti tremavano mentre giravamo quella scena era concentratissimo sul ruolo aveva creato questo avversario iconico stava interpretando un joker che nessuno aveva mai interpretato prima molto pi spaventoso anarchico di quanto nessuno avesse mai visto qualcosa nello stile di arancia meccanica ed era unottima scena per iniziare quella
5261552 devo dire onestamente che ogni scena che realizzavamo con lui mi sorpren
5261553 non penso che chris avrebbe fermato heath neanche se avesse voluto farlo
5261554 adoro il fatto che chris abbia creato in questo film che appartiene al genere supereroistico la possibilit che la gente parli di riconoscimenti per un attore di solito non viene neanche presa in considerazione la possibilit quindi complimenti a chris per averlo fatto e a heath per aver realizzato una performance cos devastante ha alzato il livello con essa
5261555 penso che verr nominato lacademy tende a snobbare film come questo a quanto pare non prendono seriamente questo genere perch non rientra nelle loro cose tendono a non guardare al lavoro che viene fatto in film come questi ma in questo caso ritengo che la recitazione sia cos buona che la sua performance sia cos elevata da rendere davvero difficile lipotesi che non arrivi una nomination alloscar come non protagonista ndt
5261556 sono molto fiducioso nel fatto che la sua performance sia stata montata esattamente come sarebbe stata montata se heath non fosse morto e stato davvero importante per me inserirla nel film cos come lui avrebbe voluto e come lui voleva che fosse mostrata al pubblico
5261557 risponder a questo dicendo semplicemente che questo sminuisce la sua bravura come attore il lavoro di un attore il lavoro di qualuno che prende un personaggio e riesce a distinguerlo dalla vita vera chiunque abbia mai passato del tempo sul set di un film sa bene che ci sono ambienti molto artificiali e che la bravura di un attore come heath ledger e christian bale sta nel rendere il tutto reale portando il vero personaggio davanti alla cinepresa
5261558 si trattava del set di un film dove cerano bambini ovunque chiunque parlava di bambini ognuno mostrava le foto dei suoi figli ero lunico nella roulotte a non avere figli heath mi mostr le foto di sua figlia e me ne parl e diceva spesso matilda ha fatto questo ha fatto questaltro
5261559 la gente parla dellintensit di un attore come christian bale ho sentito parlare del fatto che christian un attore del metodo
5261560 dir che era una persona carismatica e molto ordinaria una persona calda amichevole rendeva le cose semplici aveva molta attenzione delle persone che lo circondavano mentre lavorava e rendeva questo piacevole era un professionista quelli che lo conoscevano e quelli che ebbero la fortuna di lavorare con lui testimoniano la grande differenza tra la persona che era e il mostro che aveva creato con joker vederlo costruire questo mostro giorno dopo giorno stata la testimonianza pi grande della sua bravura come attore ed era eccitande a vedersi
5261561 penso che heath mi dar forza come attore in virt della sua performance ora sono pi forte aperto e pronto ad affrontare le difficolt penso che il breve tempo che abbiamo passato assieme vivr con me per sempre e mi render un attore pi coraggioso
5261562 ho lavorato con un ragazzo molto dolce e con un grande cuore una persona adorabile ho lavorato con questo ragazzo cos dedito al suo ruolo e al lavoro che voleva pi di tutto essere preso sul serio come attore era puntuale conosceva le battute ed era un ragazzo simpatico
5261563 ho apprezzato immensamente lavorare con lui chiaramente una tragedia il fatto che stiamo parla ndo della sua ultima performance completa vorrei tanto che fosse qui nella stanza con noi parlerebbe sarebbe di compagnia non vedevo lora di lavorare con lui ancora in futuro di essere suo amico per molti anni a venire ma questo film pu essere una celebrazione del suo talento era un talento incredibile e sono stato molto fortunato a essere testimone di questo talento e lavorare con lui e conoscerlo come uomo

5261617 financially motivated targeted attacks are definitely focusing on pos systems
5261618 as with all business critical systems merchants must ensure they start with secure pos software and configurations and then implement and enforce strong change control and vulnerability management processes to make sure that only authorized updates are allowed
5261619 with both margin pressure and the number of publicized and unpublicized data breaches on the rise retailers cannot afford to cobble together combinations of audit anti virus and list based security tools on their critical pos systems
5261620 pos check and control goes beyond the security flavor of the week by giving retailers the power to ensure their pos systems remain secure and only change when the merchant wants them to

5261631 i snuck onto your ship before you left club penguin
5261632 arrgh i told you my ship is no place for stowaways you belong to club penguin ive got half my mind to take you back without delay first this morning
5261633 if you go back now youre ship is doomed carry your adventure and find the buried treasure
5261634 i thought if i could covince you to take me with you i could get away forever
5261635 they werent friendly or helpful i dressed up and went to parties but the penguins just made fun of me and teased me about my name one penguin told me there was a party at the dojo and said he would meet me there i was excited to make a friend and went there straight away when i got there the room was empty later i found him dancing on the iceberg he wouldnt talk to me i felt like an outsider without any friends i dont think i belong there rockhopper
5261636 yarr jumped up and down on my shoulders in response
5261637 you see why dont you return to club penguin there are penguins who missed you terriblely give it a second chance
5261638 we teased you because we were jealous of your bracelet but we were too shy to ask you about it
5261639 its not that your wrong walter its just that youre an asshole
5261640 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
5261641 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night

5261645 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporarily and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal

5261650 from the results of our various studies homspera continues to show remarkable versatility as a stand alone therapeutic we are developing a number of formulations for non military and military uses such as the spray on application we are exploring with biocure inc and the topical gel application we are exploring with delsite that we believe will strengthen our position for out licensing and or expedited product development for homspera

5261674 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
5261675 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa

5261677 we have known for a long time that ear infections can damage taste because the major taste nerve the chorda tympani nerve passes through the middle ear on its way to the brain
5261678 when we learned that taste damage can intensify non taste sensations from foods all of the pieces of the puzzle fell into place
5261679 one public health consequence of these observations may well be to alert parents and pediatricians to the long term consequences of childhood earaches
5261680 knowledge of a sensory basis for this class of over nutrition might allow for the development of new obesity prevention strategies
5261681 but ear infections are not genetic this is environmental and this is something you can stop
5261682 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged
5261683 the embryonic turn around we saw in physics last year has been consolidated upon with the number of students taking the subject going up by 2
5261684 it is another good year for chemistry and biology which both continue the steady increases theyve seen in recent years
5261685 aside from these trends all the students who have succeeded in this years a levels deserve to be wholeheartedly congratulated its an achievement they should be proud of
5261686 in the longer term if we are to see further increases in students taking maths and science a levels it is vital that there are enough specialist teachers who can bring these subjects alive to their students unless this is the case the increasing number of students taking maths and the sciences at a level could erode the already limited time that specialist teachers can devote to younger students inspiring these students will be key to increasing the numbers studying maths and the sciences at a level in the coming years

5261693 snacks like chips cookies and dried fruit have cariogenic caries inducing sugars that can stay stuck on teeth for long periods
5261694 fresh fruits and veggies make the healthiest snacks and things like apple slices carrot sticks and string cheese even come in lunchbox friendly packets
5261695 parents need to make sure their children have a regular dental checkup before starting school especially since an oral health assessment is now required for children entering public schools in california
5261696 a dentist can assess the childs risk for caries offer protective measures such as sealants and determine if treatment for cavities or other problems is needed

5261698 and as the problem gets worse it not only hurts more but also gets much more expensive to fix
5261699 since the growth of breast cancer is dependent on vegfr 2 activation imc 1121b presents a unique opportunity to optimize this therapeutic approach as imc 1121b uniquely binds to the vegfr 2 receptor itself thereby blocking many vegf ligands from activating it
5261700 unlike bevacizumab that targets only a single ligand and unlike small molecule drugs that target many unrelated receptors imc 1121b specifically targets only vegfr 2 this clinical trial will help us understand whether this approach produces greater activity with fewer side effects
5261701 this trial of imc 1121b highlights the efforts of trio to bring promising new therapies to women with breast cancer which remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women today
5261702 our efforts also demonstrate trios commitment to transforming our understanding of cancer biology into clinical trials by testing compounds like imc 1121b across the spectrum of human cancer

5261734 in recognition of their hemorrhage control research and the resultant development of woundstat a product that will significantly increase survival of the combat wounded
5261735 our team did great work in inventing woundstat it is rewarding knowing that your work can help save lives of warfighters and other trauma victims and it is great to be recognized as well
5261736 we are proud of these gentlemen not only for their scientific and medical expertise but also for their dedication to our collective mission of advancing combat casualty care woundstat is now being deployed within the us military and has the potential to dramatically increase the survival rate of warfighters with severe bleeding injuries
5261737 our partnership with vcu and these dedicated scientists has been tremendously productive
5261738 our influenza program is a superb example of the convergence of both our novel rnai technologies and proprietary drug delivery capabilities
5261739 in order to accelerate development of this important lead candidate capitalize on the significant research effort conducted by our team and fully realize its commercial potential as a therapeutic against a pandemic influenza outbreak we are seeking a strategic partnership with a company focused in the biodefense or infectious disease area
5261740 there is a significant need for a safe and effective therapy that can target highly pathogenic influenza strains such as avian flu and to have that therapy stockpiled for a pandemic outbreak
5261741 capitalizing on both our proprietary rnai technologies and our proprietary drug delivery capabilities we have developed an rnai based compound that can address all strains of influenza a virus by targeting conserved regions of the influenza viral genome ongoing and future studies in collaboration with the u s centers for disease control and prevention will continue to analyze the intranasal delivery of our dicer substrate sirna for influenza and provide us further insight into the strength of our therapeutic and delivery approaches
5261742 the preliminary results of the power3s study look very promising clinicians around the world look forward to adding a tool to diagnose and treat alzheimers earlier and therefore give the best care to their patients
5261743 this study confirms power3s panel of neurodegenerative biomarkers ability to diagnose alzheimers disease with superior sensitivity and specificity with results in the 95 range additionally the current study validates power3s collection storage shipping processing and biostatistical analysis methods
5261744 power3 is planning to expand its validation study for nuropro to include two additional clinical sites within the u s larger patient cohorts of different ethnic and environmental backgrounds will strengthen the validity of nuropros applicability in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases
5261745 this study confirms that power3 is rapidly approaching the stage to commercializing the first ever blood serum proteomic tests for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases these encouraging alzheimers test results and the numerous validation studies that are currently underway for parkinsons disease als and similar neurological disorders demonstrates our commitment to bringing these tests to market in late 2008 or early 2009 we believe this test will be a major breakthrough for patients and physicians as it will offer a means to detect neurodegenerative diseases at their earliest stages allowing physicians to begin treatment at stages which will produce more positive outcomes
5261746 this award exemplifies the strong leadership of dr zhang in translational biomaterials research based on outstanding basic science
5261747 our goal as bioengineers is to get potential life saving treatments such as this from the research lab to the patient in an expedient manner
5261748 this is the first high resolution family based study which examined in a systematic manner whether rare copy number mutations contribute to sporadic schizophrenia
5261749 the affymetrix technology made it possible for us to discover that de novo copy number mutations account for at least 10 percent of the non familial cases of this devastating disease now that we better understand what brain development pathways are involved with schizophrenia we can look at better ways of treating it in the future
5261750 identifying these genetic deletions provides us with rich clues to follow up in future research on schizophrenia
5261751 recent advances in high quality genotyping such as the newest chip technologies from affymetrix enabled us to determine the importance of copy number variations through true genome wide surveys
5261752 the affymetrix snp array 6 0 enables researchers to perform the most powerful whole genome association and copy number studies ever by genotyping more markers across more individuals at a lower cost per sample
5261753 scientists around the world are using this power to discover rare genetic variations associated with complex diseases these three recent schizophrenia discoveries are great examples of research breakthroughs that should bring us closer to a day when we can diagnose treat and potentially cure this debilitating disorder

5261807 v festival has a reputation as slightly too corporate maybe not as hardcore as reading leeds or glastonbury and a bit too pop for true festival goers however anyone that buys into this school of thought had their opinion blown out of the water over the weekend as kings of leon muse and the verve amongst others made it a rock extravaganza to remember the majority of my early hours of the festival were filled with joy due to the weather conditions it was as good as i could have hoped for really not perfect but the rain stayed away for the most part my optimism was heightened by the opening performance on the sessions stage where liverpool band the troubadours impressed with their ramshackle indie pop i followed this up with catching the hold steady in the 4music stage whose down beat punk rock stunned the crowd into a trance avoiding the temptation of amy macdonald the virgin mobile stage was my next port of call to catch innovative rapper roots manuva he proved that hes the man to live up to in british hip hop as he cascaded through witness the fitness and new single buff nuff again though my stay was not long as will young was the following act i realised i hadnt watched a band on the main stage in great detail i caught a snippet of the futureheads earlier in the day but thought that the kooks jingle jangle stylings could be the perfect way to introduce me to the biggest stage in a way i was wrong they have got some hits that get the crowd going mainly from their debut album and i admit i was tempted to go and mix it up down the front at one point but when they follow indie classics like matchbox with dreary efforts like new song shine on you wonder if the v festival sceptics have a point after sampling the brilliant thamesbeat of jamie ts set in the jjb arena i was left with a decision stereophonics on the main stage or the pigeon detectives on the 4music stage after much deliberation my mate convinced me that the pigeon detectives were a bunch if talentless show offs his words not mine and we went to catch the welsh rockers in action it proved to be a good decision as kelly jones led his band through a set of brit pop classics such as a thousand trees and dakota that were executed with upmost professionalism the biggest decision of the day was left to the headliners in order to watch main stage headliners muse we had to sacrifice either ian brown my mate is a nutter for king monkey or prodigy who are renowned for their amazing live shows we eventually decided that if muse are good enough to sell out wembley stadium they must be something special and so they were its hard to believe they are only a three piece sometimes there sound was so epic and awe inspiring and this is coming from someone who is not a huge fan closing track knights of cydonia was one of the highlights of the weekend and one of the moments for why festivals were invented though i had missed out on the pogues team waterpolo and richard hawley the day was thoroughly enjoyable as was the night drinking merriment and random shenanigans around the camp sight bring on tomorrow its weird how quickly hangovers disappear at festivals it must be the cold breeze clearing your head in the morning theres no time for lounging around all day complaining that your head hurts anyway the 4music stage kicks off day two with a dazzling showcase of mod punk from the rifles its amazing that this band dont receive more coverage especially when noah and the whale who i catch on the virgin mobile union stage have been receiving so much attention for their recently released debut i found them bland and lifeless though i must admit that 5 years time is growing on me we whizzed back to the 4music stage for the courteeners who thanked the crowd for coming to see them rather than scouting for girls dont mention it the mancs were impressive sure but suffer from a case of not quite as good as they think they are syndrome the status of hero of the weekend goes to reverend and the makers john mcclure the man tries so hard to make a difference shunning mundane indie and questioning major world topics as shown in his a cappella rap against the iraq war before launching into heavyweight champion of the world i stay put for the view who despite having a selection of genuinely good songs on record fail to inspire the closing three acts on the main stage seemed like compulsory viewing despite having to miss the charlatans hot chip and the chemical brothers each act on the main stage posed intriguing questions will amy winehouse be straight enough in the head to put on a show to match her undoubted talent will kings of leon live up to the best band in the world tag that so many have labelled them with have the verve truly returned winehouse would not have impressed the purists she missed a few words and was ten minutes late on stage but when she turned up her set was well received and a success dedicating wake up alone to her currently imprisoned husband blake fielder civil she belted out rehab and back to black to a huge crowd and proved that whatever the tabloids say she is a prestigious vocalist kings of leon were predictably impeccable they are the best band in the world at the moment no question the buzz surrounding new single sex on fire is warranted and other new tracks crawl and manhattan sound like classics in the making they stormed through their set with effortless cool hardly saying a word as per usual the hype is justified the verve have the hardest act to follow the wigan lads undoubtedly triumphed at glastonbury and followed that show up with another successful outing here richard ashcroft proved to be more than up to the job as the festival closing frontman as he expressed his love for the crowd and dedicated a song to the recently departed isaac hayes ashcroft also commented on the state of the weather as the heavens opened for the start of the set visual entertainment was provided by the rainbow smoke that burst out during the last song finishing with an anthemic bittersweet symphony and love is noise the verve are back and probably better than ever the weekend was a success that sort of goes without saying the bands were amazing and the atmosphere in the campsite was marvellous the weather may have only been satisfactory but you cant have it all

5261943 how about this for an idea on how we can afford manny next season
5261944 for every home game remaining we should pass around a collection basket at the stadium you know like the collection baskets at church we can call it the keep manny in l a fund
5261945 lets say the dodgers average 48 000 fans for the remaining 20 home games and everyone puts 10 into the keep manny in l a fund
5261946 thats 480 000 a game and 9 6 million total add that to the 50million in other contracts that will come off the books and you have 59 6million that means the mccourts only would have to come up with another 40 4million to reach the 100million contract manny most likely is seeking piece of cake
5261947 there have been not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england
5261948 when i first met the boss he said that maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but actually i felt really good straight away
5261949 i have a personal programme with the physio to get stronger because everyone has told me english football is different with more contact
5261950 it is just to be stronger and to be able to cope with the 50 50s and the intensity of english football i am working hard in training and felt really good out on the pitch
5261951 i could not dream of a better start to score in my first game after four minutes
5261952 now i will have to continue week in and week out and hopefully i can keep playing like this that will be brilliant
5261953 i did not feel nervous every time i go on the pitch i always want to take a lot of pleasure from the game i do not put pressure on myself
5261954 before the game the manager told me everything would be fine and with the football we play at arsenal we would be ok
5261955 i just wanted to enjoy myself and that is what i did
5261956 the matter is that its a right of those who form commissions this position could be criticized but its a concern of theirs to say the truth i do not agree with that completely i am not speaking that all applications should be satisfied but we were to treat this matter with greater attention and it was my constant recommendation however actions of local authorities are legal and i cannot correct them in any way as it is a right of those who form commissions they choose candidates themselves
5261957 one or two countries can be mistaken in their policy regarding a certain state but since the entire european community sees that there is something wrong with belarus attitude to our common values i think that all these countries cannot be mistaken
5261958 for example there exists a list of 41 belarusian officials who are banned from entering the eu
5261959 the european union considers these people involved in some events in belarus that are not only unwelcome but also intolerable in europe at present in particular these are disappearances of people and violence against opposition politicians
5261960 the russian side brought new military equipment to gori is a violation of achieved agreements
5261961 chads injury was a shoulder sprain well be able to treat it conservatively he obviously needs to get it strengthened it came out and went right back in on the field so thats where it is

5261966 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5261967 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5261968 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5261969 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5261970 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5261971 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5261972 i still think ive got to improve a little like my overall game but it was nice to get the two goals today
5261973 weve been practising a lot on finishing in training during the week and it was pretty similar to that game and i knew what i was doing and luckily enough it went in today
5261974 it was a very very hard game to play in and i was absolutely knackered towards the end and im sure everyone was
5261975 falkirk kept putting us under pressure and all credit to them but i think we deserved to win and i think we could have scored more goals
5261976 i thought alan obrien was absolutely brilliant today but to be fair he has been looking brilliant in pre season as well and i think the hibs fans will see the best of alan obrien this season now that hes got his confidence back that he maybe needed
5261977 mirror copies of the volume directory dont match volume sys not mounted
5261978 the injury has been back and forth through his training and his rest through the years and this is the main problem for mondays performance
5261979 unprecedented pressure was exerted at my initiative group local authorities in lidas behaviour is inadequate criminal cases have been brought up against two members of my initiative group
5261980 my personal position is we are to announce that the elections are unfair and which is the most important thing that there is no control over the vote count it means that there would be no vote counting but figures prepared beforehand will be announced in this connection i think the united democratic forces and the bpf must declare boycott and order their candidates to withdraw why not at once in order to have a possibility to appear in state media
5261981 in fact its a demonstration that nobody is going to count votes of electors during the

5261998 could it be as some have suggested that mothers who use cell phones frequently are simply not very attentive parents sure but those children who were only exposed in utero had significant increases in behavior problems too which suggests there may be something deeper going on

5262019 we have only partial information about make up of precinct commissions still but the tendency is much worse that when forming district electoral commissions for instance in barysau none of the representatives of the united democratic forces was included in precinct election commissions

5262046 figures speak for themselves there only 7 representatives of the democratic forces in 125 precinct commissions however the electoral code does not strictly limit the number of members in these commissions
5262047 gives grounds to question openness and transparency of the imminent elections
5262048 there was no discussion on the candidates every session lasted for about 15 minutes

5262050 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
5262051 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
5262052 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
5262053 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
5262054 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
5262055 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today
5262056 he medvedev has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the soviet union of the 1950s had over the soviet union nobody can even remember his name
5262057 it would be far more useful nobody would count voters votes that is why it would be better to send money to orphans as we have thousands of them than to play a game without rules
5262058 there are very many aspirants there have never been so many people who want to join election commissions

5262067 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5262068 im not really thinking about tomorrow to be honest this is just a relief more than anything else
5262069 we knew we were going to win but to actually do it while youre under a bit of pressure is just so great
5262070 we didnt realise what kind of time we had we thought we might beat the record but not by three seconds
5262071 we knew the gold wasnt ours by right and that we had to give our best performance
5262072 we gave 100 percent and thats what you get to me the medal is more important than the record
5262073 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5262074 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5262075 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5262076 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5262077 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5262078 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5262079 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5262080 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5262081 they want to impeach me now why do they want to do it
5262082 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5262083 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5262084 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5262085 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5262119 we have seen striking results these dads are still allowed to have a beer and enjoy things in moderation it was subtle changes to their nutritional habits that made the difference they see their lives change they sleep better and have much more fun together

5262188 the new signings want the ball to feet they want to pass and move and not look for the long ball
5262189 i think you will see a lot more passing football from us this season and i think we can give a lot of teams problems with it we set a high tempo against liverpool and had chances so were disappointed not to get a draw from the game

5262200 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
5262201 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
5262202 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations

5262232 p e i is really a national leader when it comes to wind energy mackay told the guardian
5262233 that potential can be found all over atlantic canada and when you couple that with the hydropower in newfoundland you have nuclear power which is clean energy coming out of new brunswick and they also have wind potential as does nova scotia
5262234 what we need to do as weve been able to do with the atlantic gateway is bring the four provinces together to have a meaningful discussion on how we couple that or bundle that natural green energy potential and look for markets such as the new england states
5262235 its entirely in keeping with the federal governments national plans to reduce greenhouse gas and become less reliant on fossil fuels particularly coal in nova scotia and move towards that clean renewable green energy

5262239 accumulating our past experiences in nas development the ds408 reaches the goal of 55 mb sec in raid 5 reading and 33 mb sec in raid 5 writing
5262240 moreover such high efficiency of a nas appliance goes together with energy saving
5262241 compared with an average pc found on the current market instead of burning an outrageous 200w ds408 only calls for a relatively low power consumption of approximately 40w under normal operation with four hard drives installed

5262274 over 125 years this is how we supported the ministry and rehabilitated lives
5262275 now theres so much competition in the recycling market its harder to raise funds our rehab centers are not government funded but are completely self sufficient from donations and marketing those donations the highest return on recycling is retail
5262276 we have to collect well sort well and retail well in an effort to play catchup with the world we have to go from older downtown locations we have to have a place big enough to draw enough traffic to support the rehab centers
5262277 were trying to draw people to us and get rid of the stigma of going to the salvation army stores
5262278 our competition has savvy operators you go in there and theyre very upscale twenty years ago there wasnt the resale market there is now in the last 20 years over 22 000 thrift shops have opened and most are for profit stores that are slick shiny and well lit to compete we have to do the same
5262279 and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him teacher which commandment is the law is the greatest he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart
5262280 one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them all well he asked him which commandment is first of all
5262281 just then a lawyer stood up to test jesus teacher he said what must i do to inherit eternal life he said to him what is written in the law what do you read there he answered you shall love the lord your god with all your heart

5262285 hear o israel the lord is our god the lord is one and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart

5262293 my life philosophy is that the best time of your life is now because you dont live yesterday and you dont live tomorrow you live today so do not be reckless because tomorrow will come and so will five years from now so plan ahead but do not over plan make sure you live enough today to make sure that if tomorrow never comes you can leave satisfied

5262298 when your dad and i got married we didnt even have a refrigerator
5262299 he got like 1 32nd which came to 100 we used it to buy a refrigerator
5262300 we had these sort of pantries that had shelves with little holes opening to the outside covered with screen to keep out insects and mosquitos but it would let in the cool air it didnt get that hot even in the summer in the winter we had shelves on the outside porches too

5262304 were just an advisory board so all this would have to be approved by selectmen
5262305 we as a department dont see that as a good idea
5262306 there would still have to be some heating at south fire station because wed need to store trucks there theyre not all going to fit in the new station
5262307 i think that was the idea of the townspeople when we voted to build that building and my understanding is thats still the idea
5262308 were not telling the fire department to sell the building they can still use it for some storage were just saying it isnt going to be heated
5262309 the library is facing a significant budget hurdle because of the way they chose to do their budget and we feel they should reduce their hours rather than penalize other town departments
5262310 every time you open the door youre letting cool air in and warm air out
5262311 if you take away an entire day of having to do that plus allow the building to stay shut down for three days in a row youre creating less of a demand for heat
5262312 the soldiers on the ground need those beans and bullets to conduct their mission

5262317 my mission was to push supply mainly fuel out to fire bases in our area of operation
5262318 we had all the air support and coverage we needed to make it through the mission

5262340 i think it will take a little while for the chinese people to adjust to this reality
5262341 no one would have blamed you if you had walked the 110 metres you would still be the gold medal winner in our hearts
5262342 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5262343 or an entirely new song we are getting close to having all of the material for the next album written this brings me to the next point
5262344 how are these songs sounding and what can we expect musically from lehnen in the future
5262345 should get a amp job and learn what its like to earn a living
5262346 if you dont have it eventually youre going to die
5262347 once buzzcocks had done a few gigs including the famous lesser free trade hall there was a bit of a thing around them but howard devoto was thinking about going back to college the future was very uncertain we just thought we need to document this lets make a record
5262348 after we put spiral scratch out we started getting tapes from people like cabaret voltaire and gang of four and we werent in a position to do anything other than offer support slots
5262349 i would have put it out if id had the money
5262350 in 1977 there were hundreds of a4 fanzines mostly words jon savage and i wanted to produce a fanzine that was slightly different a3 on glossy paper no text we had the idea it would somehow stand slightly apart
5262351 we put out a fanzine that says fanzines can be anything you want they dont have to be slavish copies of sniffin glue
5262352 i just thought it was a conceit to turn that round
5262353 its a wonderful contradiction something secret and at the same time public it seemed a very nice and neat title
5262354 the secret public were the people we were trying to reach
5262355 it was sold in rough trade and other independent record shops hidden under the counter a lot of people got it through friends and friends of friends
5262356 it didnt have a price on it which was possibly a mistake
5262357 it filtered through to a guy called perry haines who founded i d and he took from it i could do a magazine just pictures of people wearing clothes and ask them what they are wearing and where they got it
5262358 putting a different kind of noise in the system and seeing what would happen
5262359 once buzzcocks were kind of established and there was a team around them like pete monks the tour manager and sue cooper boons assistant there was a little more space to operate in and god bless maggie trotter the bookkeeper there were some resources
5262360 factory was the hip manchester label in everyones mind so we were always fighting that a bit especially with press which was so important then
5262361 i remember the three of us leaving the stage and standing at the bar
5262362 wed barricaded the front of the stage for some reason and hidden everything and we came off and theres still all these tape loops playing and the crowds stood there watching and were at the bar
5262363 affecting people in the audience physically i watched people in the audience throw up
5262364 i think we only actually did four gigs altogether and shelley did two of those
5262365 the main nucleus of it was me and francis really we did most of the recording
5262366 this record is so incredibly alive it attacks like a slap in the face
5262367 a bit more open ended we would say post punk actually a bit more jazzy
5262368 he was our producer factory had hannett we had stuart
5262369 new hormones didnt have a lot of money to spend in the studios so it was very much about getting it down there wasnt a great amount of time for experimentation my idea was to just bring the best out of the bands as much as possible i certainly wasnt trying to imprint an auteurs sound on them
5262370 it was nepotism my brother in law the bands sax player joe cohen
5262371 we wouldnt have put it out if we didnt like the record even if it was family mick the singer was quite an interesting guy they were doing something other people werent doing
5262372 martin rushent wanted to do that track so richard went along with his choice lets do a ballad
5262373 in hindsight im not sure the results were that great
5262374 one of the things we struggled to do was to capture on record the sound we had live what rushent produced was really good but i didnt feel it was really us
5262375 i think we recorded four tracks with a view to doing a second single but that never happened
5262376 i dont think we were the favourites the label sound was more left field i never felt we really fitted in with the other bands
5262377 we had a kind of unspoken rule amongst ourselves that if anybody else does it or follows any rules of musical harmony then we dont do it mix that with a high level of energy and arrogance
5262378 spaces for a whole range of bands to play in
5262379 it wouldnt surprise me if it contained pere ubu brothers johnson bert bacharach the clash and vaughan williams exactly the sort of cross genre i embraced
5262380 bad vibes after alan erasmus asked if kath was available also they seemed a bit too cool for their own good
5262381 just a conduit into not having to have any money upfront so if they sold the records then they paid the bills
5262382 i was still in the same sort of frame of mind as with tiller boys
5262383 still quite an aggressive physical sound but using a lot of repetition id started using drum machines by then things like that very basic synthesizers as well usually i would just start by making a backing tape which could be anything like mixing in tv adverts just to create a moving texture and then id just improvise over it
5262384 it was said that erics personal energy field caused electrical and electronic equipment to malfunction he had trouble even watching tv
5262385 he used to walk around with a python round his neck
5262386 because we had a diversity of political viewpoints we decided only ever to state facts
5262387 i recall mike hinc phoning me up and saying do something else with them because he was too busy being a booking manager
5262388 andy has the perfect blend of musicality individuality and freedom
5262389 they were fronted by this really intense skinny guy steve edwards and the guitarist steve murphy was this really big fat guy
5262390 used to play with his back to the audience all the time
5262391 they were devoutly fashion neutral which we always found fascinating
5262392 they looked like civil servants whod had their desks stolen
5262393 most unsettling and powerful live act like a very focused velvets though they always ended up being compared to the fall because steve their singer shouted and had a manchester accent
5262394 steve edwards would hold a pint glass and crush it
5262395 i remember him telling someone off because they were dancing
5262396 richard loved gods gift he adored them i think they were his ideal
5262397 a typical day at 50 newton street is beyond description
5262398 i remember playing bass with dislocation dance because paul couldnt make a tv appearance
5262399 theyd be out the front cheering us and wed be cheering them it was all very friendly
5262400 i just liked the idea of these people stepping out of their normal way of working to see how they reacted to it
5262401 it was like having a house band except we didnt have a studio like berry gordy
5262402 it was the walkman era cassettes were the format of the moment
5262403 except there was nothing underneath it didnt really build any foundations
5262404 so you have the whole joke of radio sweat a parody of commercial independent local radio its nicely put together youve got linders work which was a musical work and a visual work put together biting tongues im sure we were supposed to do some text thing but didnt it wasnt just supposed to be the live it cassette
5262405 me and nathan mcgough and ambrose did a lot of research at manchester library it was too big a project really for too few people
5262406 rough trade were a bit dubious about the subject matter people being murdered set to music so uncle geoff at rt pulled the plug then richard ran out of money and so it goes
5262407 a few years later i released the mini lp on zulu the label he shared with fellow pink industry member jayne casey
5262408 i met someone when the band was in nyc and then got an offer of a paying job
5262409 things were getting pretty tight back in manchester by that time
5262410 pete leaving probably had a bigger impact than the lack of new hormones financing nothing is more important than an effective manager
5262411 wed come to the end of our time at college i had this sense of destiny i had to get a job i was about to get married
5262412 things werent going brilliantly and you dont want things to go sour its a bit like doing a set thats too long best to leave everybody on a high note rather than a low note
5262413 reichian therapy screaming birthing therapy you have to love them for that dont you you have to love richard for putting it out
5262414 richard had a contrariness about him that allowed to him see things like danger came smiling as a valid business move where others would have simply viewed such a release as indulgence
5262415 he enjoyed art and allowed it to resonate he really seemed to enjoy its meaning not just its effect or symbolism
5262416 wed talked to cnd and it was supposed to be a fundraiser it just didnt sell so it didnt raise any money in the end
5262417 my bank manager called me and said ive been having a word with richard he had the same bank manager as me i think you ought to lend him some money
5262418 i was like well im not going to which was sad in a way because maybe that was the end of new hormones i dont know he wanted five grand in those days that was a lot of dead presidents
5262419 morrissey came in saying right weve recorded hand in glove and weve got this live track from the fashion show could i help and i said no because you need more resources than i could possibly possibly offer you need to talk to simon edwards at rough trade distribution
5262420 i couldnt sustain dislocation dance anymore and id done some demos and i took them to geoff travis and he rang me and said oh this is interesting i want to talk to them and i want to talk to you
5262421 i paid two months ahead liz and i packed up all the press releases all this stuff boxes labelled them i told leslie fink the landlord we were packing up wed be going in two months but i paid he threw everything in a skip bastard
5262422 one being a multi track of the worst which is now in the hands of tony barber peters bass player tonys going to hopefully bake it see if theres anything salvageable they were great lads the worst they were crap but they were brilliant
5262423 big regret is not putting out clamour club by gods gift it was just great punk rock
5262424 have loved to do something with basil from yargo he walked into the office one day and said i want to be produced by thom bell fantastic he had ambition with the last 90 quid of new hormones money i stuck him in a four track
5262425 richard boon was the malcom mclaren of the north richards vision became the music such was his influence
5262426 he gave me a copy of nick drakes pink moon as a birthday gift the message which i didnt really pick up was thats where you should be going you should be a cross between nick drake and burt bacharach
5262427 richard was really a vital glue conceptually for everybody i think from him came that sense of its a creative house and i support you in your creative stuff
5262428 he was so clearly committed to the idea of the creative part of it that actually money hardly got discussed at all
5262429 richard detested business it wasnt him really he was more into the creative side
5262430 they could have been a big pop band they were good songwriters
5262431 our ideas were bigger than our budgets partly a product of our influences
5262432 i wanted to do plausible american cop show themes savannah band swing and bubble gum parodies it would have been easier to have just been a guitar band
5262433 maybe new hormones as a label was a little bit too diverse
5262434 the bands were diverse even though a lot of the bands shared the same producer there was no signature sound necessarily the artwork didnt have a unified style even though they were more of a family it wasnt perceived as that
5262435 there wasnt a pr department to the label it was very much hearsay it was enough to put the records out
5262436 it was just that this music should be heard and these players should be paid attention because they have hopefully something to say or they are making an interesting racket there wasnt an overarching ideology i didnt want to be ahmet erteg n or anything like that
5262437 if you look at what new hormones didnt put out the fall the smiths etc richards very generous with his advice or his enabling of other people to do things and subsequently has been a lot less successful than anybody else
5262438 he really was an important person in manchesters music history
5262439 it was a great adventure set out with that map and see where you land
5262440 wins breed confidence people will be confident but not complacent weve got to guard against that
5262441 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution

5262482 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards
5262483 i think some things should still be off limits there will be grey areas
5262484 our worry is that films are an emotive medium passions can get stirred up and people can get carried away i think this is a valid concern but i dont think an outright ban is still sensible because this is how people communicate on the web in daily life
5262485 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways to allow people to let off steam a little bit more but safely

5262735 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5262736 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5262737 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5262738 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5262739 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5262740 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5262741 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5262742 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5262745 vanderbilt in so many ways is already a great place for undergraduates and the commons is the answer to the question of how do we improve on a proven recipe for success our graduates accomplish amazing things and our faculty are top researchers and excellent teachers however we wanted to challenge ourselves to define a new model of residential education for the 21st century one that educates the whole student
5262746 we might have a major speaker come to campus and have dinner with students at the deans residence or invite distinguished physicians from our medical center over to an apartment to chat informally about how they became doctors and we definitely will watch vanderbilt sports teams on tv at my house

5262748 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5262749 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5262750 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5262751 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5262752 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5262753 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5262754 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5262755 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5262756 as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5262757 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
5262758 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
5262759 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for the vice presidency
5262760 this is one more example of the national democratic party embracing policies that threaten the stability of families
5262761 voters should remember this donation advocating for homosexuals to marry in california when democratic candidates attempt to woo evangelicals with talk of faith and values this donation does not line up with biblical truth
5262762 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5262763 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency

5262767 youre definitely going to see more independence on this album i got to work with different people and learn what their habits were and what works well with me
5262768 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5262769 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5262770 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5262771 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5262772 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5262773 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship

5262782 this significant grant will kickstart wyoming to address our nursing shortage
5262783 its a formidable road ahead but community collaboration is key to providing local solutions to this national problem at stake are nothing less than patient care and safety healthcare costs and patient health
5262784 first the state is aging even faster than the rest of the nation which means that the need for new approaches to nursing in long term care facilities must be addressed creatively
5262785 secondly because wyoming is a frontier state it simply costs more to deliver medical care plus wyoming continues to lose medical staff and dollars to neighboring states with larger populations and more healthcare capacity third while the states overall economy is robust due to the energy boom we lack the underlying healthcare infrastructure that would allow for an adequate and cost effective delivery system

5262814 in the back of my mind im thinking this guy is responsible for killing friends of mine
5262815 my buddies are not here and this guy is here what should i do with that i was ready to shoot him
5262816 i couldve gone to jail if i shot him but the way my mind was at that time i couldve been likely to shoot him and thats what i wanted to do
5262817 because i thought we were alone and once i realized we were not alone no more with all the cameras clicking around me i knew i couldnt do it

5262843 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5262844 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5262845 were obviously following up on that we had a lot of fun following up on that in a funny but realistic way it does not go unnoticed it has an effect on wilson and it has an effect on their friendship

5262847 we had talked about this type of storyline but the fact is we were only originally going to keep two we wound up keeping three and in a way we kept four this wasnt because we had this wonderful story
5262848 it seemed like a natural place to go that after three years people are just not going to stay with this man forever we like them we want to use them and thats why we didnt just cut them loose to have them just being the same three people in this team with this character seemed unnatural to be honest were still trying to find ways to use them weve found better ways as season five has gone along but its a work in progress
5262849 we broke the formula a few times right in season one and well continue doing it
5262850 we brought in a character partway through the year michael weston as this private investigator house goes to the spin off would be less of a spin off it would be more us using house to launch it it would be an independent world a character out of the house mold but definitely different

5262873 going independent in 2006 really re energized me it rejuvenated me and my feelings for the game
5262874 being on major record labels is for the birds it sucks all your energy out because the good ideas you come up with a lot of times they dont wanna do it especially on the promotional tip they follow these same ancient formulas to sell a record you gotta be creative in 2008 to sell a record thats the first thing when i started doing it independent it gave me my swagger back and made me feel like i was doing hip hop and not just doing records for somebody i just went back to the essence and stopped worrying about the hip hop fans and started worrying about ice cube fans
5262875 i wanna take it back to the real hip hop
5262876 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back by public enemy is one of the records i cherish i love i wanted to flip that and put the emphasis more on us and our community on what were doing to hold us back i also wanted to talk about whats going on in the world and how i feel about it and what im ready to do its not a game people playing hip hop like its a game lets get back to talking about what people going through so we can solve some of these issues

5262891 we are extremely concerned to hear about goods shrinking in size without shrinking in price as it cheats unsuspecting shoppers already under financial pressure from rising household and motoring costs
5262892 in america it is known as the grocery shrink ray and this is one trend from the us that we definitely dont want too much of over here
5262893 we have heard reports of a considerable number of brands downsizing in this way presumably because the grocery industry faces increased costs for energy and ingredients but doesnt want to be seen to raise prices
5262894 companies should realise that once caught out their corporate reputation could suffer and customers always have the power to switch brands a brand need to be trusted by shoppers to survive so any company considering short changing their customers should think again
5262895 the food industry in line with other sectors is facing rising costs across the board from raw ingredients to energy and transport bills
5262896 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable in order to offer our consumers value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs rather than directly raising prices
5262897 the decision to introduce a new 15 can pack of strongbow was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices in the face of the widespread and unprecedented increase in business costs and the retailers desire to continue to offer the brand in similar party pack format at the same price point
5262898 had retailers not chosen to go down this route they would have had to pass on a hefty price increase to purchasers of the old 18 can pack and they clearly feel that no price increase on a smaller pack offers better consumer value
5262899 the nappy industry has seen a significant increase in the cost of raw materials over the past few years driven by commodity cost inflation for example pulp prices have increased by 18 since 2005 and crude oil by 25

5262936 he was a natural the undisputed master of agitation who could engage a room full of recruiting targets in a rapid fire socratic dialogue nudging them to admit that they were not living up to their own standards as with the panhandler he could be aggressive and confrontational with probing sometimes personal questions he would pinpoint the source of pain in their lives tearing down their egos just enough before dangling a carrot of hope that they could make things better
5262937 what i saw was a powerful demonstration of an impulse and need for african american men to come together to recognize each other and affirm our rightful place in the society historically african americans have turned inward and towards black nationalism whenever they have a sense as we do now that the mainstream has rebuffed us and that white americans couldnt care less about the profound problems african americans are facing
5262938 i thought she was a good public servant it the process by which obama had gotten palmers name removed from the ballot was very awkward that part of it i wish had played out entirely differently

5262942 what i am opposed to is the attempt by potential hacks like republican strategist karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured a rise in the poverty state a drop in the medium income to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone thorough the worst month since the great depression thats what i am opposed to
5262943 you and millions of others working through moveon have helped change the way politics works in this country
5262944 to give everyone one big refund on their government divvy it up by individual portions in the form of tax breaks hand it out and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care their own retirement plan their own child care their own education and so on
5262945 they call this the ownership society but in our past there has been another term for it social darwinism every man or woman for him or herself its a tempting idea because it doesnt require much thought or ingenuity
5262946 what wasnt colorblind was the indifference human efforts will always pale in comparison to natures forces but the bush administration is a set of folks who simply dont recognize whats happening in large parts of the country

5262960 i am absolutely convinced that white black latino asian people want to move beyond our divisions and they want to join together in order to create a movement for change in this country the republicans may have a different attitude the policies that they have promoted have not been good at providing ladders for upward mobility and opportunity for all people
5262961 i was fighting against republican ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor rezko in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago

5262963 and barack obama has our members fired up and ready to go on that front
5262964 in just a few years the members of moveon have once again demonstrated that real change comes not from the top down but from the bottom up from their principled opposition to the iraq war a war i also opposed from the start to their strong support for a number of progressive causes moveon shows what americans can achieve when we come together in a grassroots movement for change i thank them for their support and look forward to working with their members in the weeks and months ahead
5262965 my position on hamas is indistinguishable from the position of hillary clinton or republican presidential candidate john mccain i said they are a terrorist organization and ive repeatedly condemned them ive repeatedly said and i mean what i say since they are a terrorist organization we should not be dealing with them until they recognize israel renounce terrorism and abide by previous agreements
5262966 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5262967 i still believe in affirmative action as a means of overcoming both historic and potentially current discrimination
5262968 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
5262969 fun d legislation that requires equitable prescription coverage for contraceptives under health plans
5262970 fun d legislation that would create and expand teen pregnancy prevention programs and education programs concerning emergency contraceptives
5262971 it does not work for all people equally and that is why its critical to have a president who sends a signal that we are going to have a system of justice that is not just us but is everybody
5262972 w e know that in our criminal justice system african americans and whites for the same crime are arrested at very different rates are convicted at very different rates receive very different sentences
5262973 provide job training substance abuse and mental health counseling to ex offenders so that ex convicts are successfully re integrated into society
5262974 a prison to work incentive program to improve ex offender employment and job retention rates
5262975 for many inner city men what prevents gainful employment is not simply the absence of motivation to get off the streets but the absence of a job history or any marketable skills and increasingly the stigma of a prison record we can assume that with lawful work available for young men now in the drug trade crime in any community would drop
5262976 theres a strong overlap between gang affiliation and young men of color
5262977 i think its problematic for them nonwhites to be singled out as more likely to receive the death penalty for carrying out certain acts than are others who do the same thing
5262978 were going to put more money into education than we have
5262979 will provide critical supports to young children and their parents
5262980 create or expand high quality early care and education programs for pregnant women and children from birth to age five
5262981 quadruple the number of eligible children for early head start
5262982 provide affordable and high quality child care that will ease the burden on working families
5262983 home visiting programs by health care personnel to all low income first time mothers
5262984 but the latest in a string of decisions by this conservative bloc of justices that turn back the clock on decades of advancement and progress in the struggle for equality
5262985 these were local school districts that had voluntarily made a determination that all children would be better off if they learned together
5262986 a racially diverse learning environment has a profoundly positive educational impact on all students
5262987 i am going to give health insurance to 47 million americans who are now without coverage
5262988 for every 1 00 earned by a man the average woman receives only 77 cents
5262989 a recent study estimates it will take another 47 years for women to close the wage gap with men
5262990 believes the government needs to take steps to better enforce the equal pay act fight job discrimination and improve child care options and family medical leave to give women equal footing in the workplace
5262991 it is hard to overstate the degree to which our addiction to oil undermines our future a large portion of the 800 million we spend on foreign oil every day goes to some of the worlds most volatile regimes and there are the environmental consequences just about every scientist outside the white house believes climate change is real we cannot drill our way out of the problem instead of subsidizing the oil industry we should end every single tax break the industry currently receives and demand that 1 of the revenues from oil companies with over 1 billion in quarterly profits go toward financing alternative energy research and infrastructure
5262992 global warming is real is happening now and is the result of human activities
5262993 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
5262994 warrantless surveillance of american citizens in defiance of fisa is unlawful and unconstitutional
5262995 a that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates b that of having a fixed distinctive sign a uniform or emblem recognizable at a distance c that of carrying arms openly and d that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war
5262996 why dont we close guantanamo and restore the right of habeas corpus because thats how we lead not with the might of our military but the power of our ideals and the power of our values its time to show the world were not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries
5262997 obama has urged us to go back to the era of criminal justice prosecution of terror suspects citing the successful efforts to imprison those who bombed the world trade center in 1993
5262998 this is big because that prosecution and the ground rules for it had more to do with our
5262999 as a result we didnt know that osama bin laden and al qaeda were responsible for the attack until 1997 too late for us to grab osama when sudan offered to send him to us in 1996
5263000 obamas embrace of the post 93 approach shows a blindness to the key distinction that has kept us safe since 9 11 the difference between
5263001 would immediately begin to pull out troops engaged in combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month to be completed by the end of 2009 he would call for a new constitutional convention in iraq convened with the united nations which would not adjourn until iraqs leaders reach a new accord on reconciliation he would use presidential leadership to surge our diplomacy with all of the nations of the region on behalf of a new regional security compact and he would take immediate steps to confront the humanitarian disaster in iraq and to hold accountable any perpetrators of potential war crimes
5263002 the state department pledged to allow 7 000 iraqi refugees into america
5263003 but has only let 190 into the united states president obama would expedite the department of homeland securitys review of iraqi asylum applicants
5263004 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5263005 but yet youre saying given what you know now you still wouldnt support the surge so im just trying to understand this
5263006 because its pretty straightforward by us putting 10 billion to 12 billion a month 200 billion thats money that could have gone into afghanistan those additional troops could have gone into afghanistan that money also could have been used to shore up a declining economic situation in the united states that money could have been applied to having a serious energy security plan so that we were reducing our demand on oil which is helping to fund the insurgents in many countries so those are all factors that would be taken into consideration in my decision to deal with a specific tactic or strategy inside of iraq
5263007 jerusalem should remain united and should be recognized as israels capital
5263008 jerusalem will remain israels capital and no one should want or expect it to be re divided
5263009 let me be clear jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
5263010 t he truth is that this was an example where we had some poor phrasing in the speech
5263011 we dont want barbed wire running through jerusalem similar to the way it was prior to the 67 war
5263012 i will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending i will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems i will not weaponize space i will slow our development of future combat systems i will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary defense spending i will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons to seek that goal i will not develop new nuclear weapons i will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material
5263013 do you agree that the rich arent paying their fair share of taxes
5263014 theres no doubt that the tax system has been skewed and the bush tax cuts people didnt need them and they werent even asking for them and thats why they need to be less so that we can pay for universal health care and other initiatives
5263015 his plan would boost the top marginal income tax rate to well over 55 percent before the inclusion of state and local taxes resulting in many individuals seeing their marginal tax rate double
5263016 high income individuals will be forced to pay even more if they live in cities or states with high taxes such as new york city california or maryland
5263017 in each instance when the rate dropped in the 1990s revenues from the tax increased the government took in more money and in the 1980s when the capital gains tax was increased to 28 percent the revenues went down so why raise it at all especially given the fact that 100 million people in this country own stock and would be affected
5263018 which showed that the top 50 hedge fund managers made 29 billion last year t hose who are able to work the stock market and amass huge fortunes on capital gains are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries thats not fair
5263019 to impact public policy at the state and federal level and be a key business resource for small and independent business in america
5263020 supports pro business candidates who have demonstrated the skill and leadership necessary to fuel a pro business congress
5263021 allow undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens
5263022 i voted to require that illegal aliens get trained get a license get insurance to protect public safety that was my intention the problem we have here is not drivers licenses undocumented workers do not come here to drive theyre here to work
5263023 to fully embrace our values and become full members of our democracy
5263024 america has always been a nation of immigrants for the millions living here illegally but otherwise playing by the rules we must encourage them to come out of hiding and get right with the law
5263025 would allow undocumented children brought to the united states the opportunity to pursue higher education or serve in our military and eventually becoming legalized citizens i nstead of driving thousands of children who were on the right path into the shadows we need to giver those who play by the rules the opportunity to succeed
5263026 i will never walk away from the 12 million undocumented immigrants who live work and contribute to our country every single day
5263027 there are few better examples of how broken bitter and divisive our politics has become than the immigration debate that played out in washington a few weeks ago
5263028 w e are a nation of immigrants a nation that has always been willing to give weary travelers from around the world the chance to come here and reach for the dream that so many of us have reached for
5263029 but thats the america that the president and too many republicans walked away from when the politics got tough w e saw parts of the immigration debate took a turn that was both ugly and racist in a way we havent seen since the struggle for civil rights
5263030 we dont expect our government to guarantee success and happiness but when millions of children start the race of life so far behind only because of race only because of class thats a betrayal of our ideals
5263031 its an american problem when one in four latinos cannot communicate well with their doctor about whats wrong or fill out medical forms because there are language barriers we refuse to break down
5263032 the theme of this la raza conference is the work of your lives strengthening america together
5263033 the system isnt working when a child in a crumbling school graduates without learning to read or doesnt graduate at all or when a young person at the top of her class a young person with so much to offer this country cant attend a public college
5263034 the system isnt working when hispanics are losing their jobs faster than almost anybody else or working jobs that pay less and come with fewer benefits than almost anybody else
5263035 the system isnt working when 12 million people live in hiding and hundreds of thousands cross our borders illegally each year when companies hire undocumented immigrants instead of legal citizens to avoid paying overtime or to avoid a union when communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids when nursing mothers are torn from their babies when children come home from school to find their parents missing when people are detained without access to legal counsel
5263036 when we get in a tussle we appeal to the founding fathers and the constitutions ratifiers to give direction some like justice scalia conclude that the original understanding must be followed and if we obey this rule democracy is respected others like justice breyer insist that sometimes the original understanding can take you only so far that on the truly big arguments we have to take context history and the practical outcomes of a decision into account i have to side with justice breyers view of the constitution that it is not a static but rather a living document and must be read in the context of an ever changing world
5263037 so that both a conservative like scalia and a leftist like ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of cases
5263038 w hen i examined judge roberts record and history of public service it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak
5263039 in his work in the white house and the solicitor generals office he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process in these same positions he seemed dismissive of concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man
5263040 there is no indication that he is not a man of fine character
5263041 but when you look at his record when it comes to his understanding of the constitution i found that in almost every case he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless
5263042 in contrast to his soaring campaign rhetoric about bringing america together obamas senate speeches against roberts and alito revealed a polarizing vision of america minorities women employees and criminal defendants were among the weak majorities men employers and prosecutors were among the strong
5263043 cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid trade debt relief
5263044 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces
5263045 it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water as we strive to rebuild americas standing in the world this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere
5263046 result in the imposition of a global tax on the united states
5263047 of u s foreign aid spending subservient to the dictates of the united nations
5263048 obamas foreign policy liberal score of 92 and conservative score of 7 indicate that he was more liberal in that issue area than 92 percent of the senators and more conservative than 7 percent
5263049 obama voted the liberal position on 65 of the 66 key votes on which he voted and garnered perfect liberal scores in both the economic and social categories
5263050 i cant believe im going to be working for like 10 hr i havent been paid that for years
5263051 i want to do something that wont feel like work
5263052 you can never have too much money in retirement there is always something to spend it on
5263053 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5263054 it was a matter of pulling data we have available on the back end around how often they visit the communities and how much they do when they are there
5263055 especially among the younger generation raised writing and speaking english in schools
5263056 all participants are bilingual and it is facilitated in english
5263057 its built to allow a brand like sheraton to feature local attractions or deliver coupons
5263058 the bottom line is that anyone making a raw commodity is vulnerable
5263059 it is absolutely the premiere concours event in the world

5263065 at 7 6 yao ming is one of the tallest olympians one of the most revered basketball players across the world and were willing to bet were there an olympic competition for aerial photography hed score heads above the rest puns aside getting a camera up into the air is no small or short feat were not all tall like yao ming and we dont always have access to a kite or a plane plus tripods and professional monopods are expensive and weigh about a gajillion pounds so we made our own photojojo sky cam just for you and just in time for your own photography olympics
5263066 once buzzcocks had done a few gigs including the famous lesser free trade hall there was a bit of a thing around them but howard devoto was thinking about going back to college the future was very uncertain we just thought we need to document this lets make a record
5263067 we researched how to do it because no one knew
5263068 petes dad put up 300 quid and they put up 150 each zero interest
5263069 there wasnt a company there was just an intervention in popular culture
5263070 it was done without paper labels to begin with the vinyl went through rollers and the label area was de bossed but the ink would spill so howard and peter and i checked every single copy
5263071 first of all we just had a thousand records and suddenly we needed more because jon webster who was the manager of manchester virgin megastore at no 9 lever street said hed take as many as we could give him this is before centralized buying at multiples like virgin
5263072 lever phoned some of his mates at other virgin stores to see who would take some and we were doing mail order there was no distribution infrastructure then and rough trade took some then rough trade wanted more and it just kept going as money from sales came in then we could afford to press some more
5263073 pete shelley and i once shelley had taken over leadership and brought garth smith in on bass had been talking about org 2
5263074 even if wed wanted to do love bites as a second seven inch which would probably have sold quite well no one would have had any money
5263075 following the white riot tour in may1977 supporting the clash enquiries were coming in from majors we didnt actively pursue any but once they started coming in wed go and visit them and we got on very well with andrew lauder at united artists
5263076 suddenly it was work it wasnt play any more although some of it was playful
5263077 things around buzzcocks became commercially confused and distracted which possibly put on hold a lot of other things which interested me a bit later
5263078 after we put spiral scratch out we started getting tapes from people like cabaret voltaire and gang of four and we werent in a position to do anything other than offer support slots the big london launch gig for another music in a different kitchen had this fantastic line up cabaret voltaire gang of four john cooper clarke slits buzzcocks one pound 50
5263079 all those people apart from the slits because they were london connected were regional people were just as adrift as we were
5263080 buzzcocks kind of provided a springboard so when they played london we could bring the fall down to fairfield hall croydon for instance and put manchester on the map put the north on the map
5263081 i would have put it out if id had the money i paid for the tapes martin hannett did a shoddy job and things were getting very difficult i gave kay carroll the bands then manager the tapes she placed them with step forward
5263082 in 1977 there were hundreds of a4 fanzines mostly words jon savage and i wanted to produce a fanzine that was slightly different a3 on glossy paper no text we had the idea it would somehow stand slightly apart
5263083 we put out a fanzine that says fanzines can be anything you want they dont have to be slavish copies of sniffin glue
5263084 there was an american west coast situationist called ken knabb who was doing his own translation of situationist texts for america under the rubric the bureau of public secrets and i just thought it was a conceit to turn that round
5263085 its a wonderful contradiction something secret and at the same time public it seemed a very nice and neat title
5263086 the secret public were the people we were trying to reach
5263087 people would find this stuff and take something from it people came to see the pistols they put some noise in the system and other people heard it and did something with it and it was the same thing with the secret public some people will find this and theyll go off and slavishly do their own collages or whatever or theyll get the idea that a magazine doesnt have to be tedious interviews with tony james
5263088 access to technology was harder then unless you worked in an organization or an institution the only place in manchester you could get photocopying was the rank xerox copy centre in piccadilly and you could never get your hands on the thing if you wanted to degrade images
5263089 it was sold in rough trade and other independent record shops hidden under the counter a lot of people got it through friends and friends of friends
5263090 it didnt have a price on it which was possibly a mistake
5263091 as so often there wasnt enough money it was either do another secret public or make a record
5263092 it filtered through to a guy called perry haines who founded i d and he took from it i could do a magazine just pictures of people wearing clothes and ask them what they are wearing and where they got it
5263093 putting a different kind of noise in the system and seeing what would happen
5263094 once the band were kind of established and there was a team around them like pete monks the tour manager who could sort things out and sue cooper boons assistant there was a little more space to operate in and god bless maggie trotter the bookkeeper there were some resources
5263095 factory was the hip manchester label in everyones mind so we were always fighting that a bit especially with press which was so important then
5263096 i remember the three of us leaving the stage and standing at the bar
5263097 wed barricaded the front of the stage for some reason and hidden everything and we came off and theres still all these tape loops playing and the crowds still stood there watching and were at the bar
5263098 there was this lovely guy called ian watson who sort of ran the fan club as he did for the negatives a group that didnt really exist me and paul morley and kevin cummins and merlin from merlin motors and he put out press releases and nme would print tiller boys play five gigs at the same time in different places but of course it was fiction it was play play is very important because its transgressive and transformative
5263099 i think we only actually did four gigs altogether and shelley did two of those
5263100 the main nucleus of it was me and francis really we did most of the recording
5263101 affecting people in the audience physically i watched people in the audience throw up
5263102 one gig in ambleside turned into a complete riot it was completely terrifying
5263103 it had been advertised a bit as shelley so they were expecting some sort of pop also every time something happened in ambleside windermere and ambleside would clash we were caught in the middle of it we had to run off stage there was a car waiting with the doors open i think the heading was punk rock riot in ambleside in the local paper
5263104 this record is so incredibly alive it attacks like a slap in the face
5263105 its february 1980 and peter francis and eric want to tell you about the delights of sandy nelson and ethnic rhythms it took till 1981 for some to listen
5263106 a bit more open ended we would say post punk actually a bit more jazzy
5263107 hammill came up to manchester and did some 8 track recordings and cut and spliced and ian wasnt entirely happy with the results
5263108 so he did his own remix peter hammill got thanked
5263109 we recorded the ludus single at the same studio i had been doing the piccadilly radio sessions
5263110 in fact it was the same songs i seem to remember tony wilson thinking that the radio session was better even though wed spent more time on the record we couldnt have spent more than two days on it one day with a bit of a lock in
5263111 he was our producer factory had hannett we had stuart
5263112 new hormones didnt have a lot of money to spend in the studios so it was very much about getting it down there wasnt a great amount of time for experimentation my idea was to just bring the best out of the bands as much as possible i certainly wasnt trying to imprint an auteurs sound on them
5263113 it was nepotism my brother in law the bands sax player joe cohen
5263114 we wouldnt have put it out if we didnt like the record even if it was family mick the singer was quite an interesting guy they were doing something other people werent doing
5263115 martin rushent wanted to do that track so richard went along with his choice lets do a ballad
5263116 in hindsight im not sure the results were that great
5263117 one of the things we struggled to do was to capture on record the sound we had live what rushent produced was really good but i didnt feel it was really us
5263118 i think we recorded four tracks with a view to doing a second single but that never happened
5263119 i dont think we were the favourites the label sound was more left field i never felt we really fitted in with the other bands
5263120 we had a kind of unspoken rule amongst ourselves that if anybody else does it or follows any rules of musical harmony then we dont do it mix that with a high level of energy and arrogance
5263121 the fashion for studios then was to have a very dead sound so it was a padded room in a cellar padded with denim like being in someones jeans
5263122 i think there was possibly some post production but essentially the chassis went down in the duration at the time
5263123 it was four hours and thats it bang that was the budget it was do or die it wasnt take 3 and take 4 or anything like that
5263124 i think thats the first time new hormones ran out of money
5263125 it was that indie thing press 500 sell 500 move on and sometimes you didnt sell 500
5263126 the rate we were working the recording was becoming less and less vital although we really liked it as a piece
5263127 so when we got the opportunity to release it somewhere else either put it out or sell it please and to their credit because they appreciated what the music was about new hormones said yeah okay
5263128 i wanted to see how an organization like north west arts could support developments not tied to professional music trevor wishart the composer in residence supported this
5263129 there would be three or four acts a night richard boon would show up and rob gretton joy division new order manager would show up
5263130 spaces for a whole range of bands to play in
5263131 it wouldnt surprise me if it contained pere ubu brothers johnson bert bacharach the clash and vaughan williams exactly the sort of cross genre i embraced
5263132 bad vibes after alan erasmus asked if kath singer way was available also they seemed a bit too cool for their own good
5263133 listening back to the early recordings i cant help thinking what was i thinking
5263134 just a conduit into not having to have any money upfront so if they sold the records then they paid the bills
5263135 all the early indie labels were trying to develop what a contract might be
5263136 basically 50 50 after costs subject to sales and that sets your budget for your next record
5263137 they had a lot of nice old analogue equipment it was like a museum
5263138 i was still in the same sort of frame of mind as with tiller boys
5263139 still quite an aggressive physical sound but using a lot of repetition id started using drum machines by then things like that very basic synthesizers as well usually i would just start by making a backing tape which could be anything like mixing in tv adverts just to create a moving texture and then id just improvise over it
5263140 it was said that erics personal energy field caused electrical and electronic equipment to malfunction he had trouble even watching tv in light of this it seems very bold of him to have pursued anything other than acoustic music
5263141 he used to walk around with a python round his neck
5263142 we sat down very normal and without even singing a note or playing a note we discussed the conceptual side of it and how it had to be ultra democratic that came to be a kind of interesting rod for our backs
5263143 because we had a diversity of political viewpoints we decided only ever to state facts
5263144 i dint get where i am today by being a right git
5263145 we were talking and somebody said simon why is it called a williot mohr diagram and the answer is because it was invented by mr diagram of course
5263146 richard boon said that he didnt think we had anything to say when he heard our tape i remember that really well
5263147 i recall mike hinc phoning me up and saying do something else with them because he was too busy being a booking manager
5263148 andy has the perfect blend of musicality individuality and freedom
5263149 they were fronted by this really intense skinny guy steven edwards and the guitarist steve murphy was this really big fat guy
5263150 used to play with his back to the audience all the time
5263151 they were devoutly fashion neutral which we always found fascinating
5263152 they looked like civil servants whod had their desks stolen
5263153 most unsettling and powerful live act like a very focused velvets though they always ended up being compared to the fall because steve their singer shouted and had a manchester accent
5263154 steve edwards would hold a pint glass and crush it
5263155 i remember him telling someone off because they were dancing
5263156 they had a very compelling angry rhythmic intentness about them
5263157 richard loved gods gift he adored them i think they were his ideal
5263158 i was living in a shared house and it didnt seem appropriate to be working from it so i found a cheap office
5263159 a typical day at 50 newton street is beyond description
5263160 musicians would come into the offices there was a beaten up old couch and theyd just hang out and spliff up can i use the phone then theyd go away and im trying to work
5263161 random was pretty out of it quite a lot of the time
5263162 the offices were hardly salubrious you knew they werent exactly rolling in it
5263163 looking back it could have been the 1930s the architecture of the building and our maverick but impoverished lifestyles somehow became blurred
5263164 richards invitation of free rent and phone was not just generous but a great opportunity to perch and gripe whilst watching the scene go by
5263165 we liked drinking as well and richard liked drinking and speed and they were probably the things that bonded us
5263166 he used to buy us halves when we were broke even though he wasnt too far behind owing to a failure to put out wham style records least favourite memory but still entertaining was the incredibly bad tempered lift operator tommy he seemed to be well past retirement age and had a grudge against the world that going up and down in a lift all day did nothing to wipe clean
5263167 ideally they were supposed to be there to pay half the rent because i couldnt afford the whole rent
5263168 alan wise is one of the most bizarre people youll ever ever encounter
5263169 the james young book about nico is fantastic on alan wise it nails him exactly
5263170 i remember having really long theological conversations with alan wise he was quite an intellectual guy
5263171 i remember he dropped a big bombshell and said you know i think the only way to be is to be christo buddhist and i was absolutely rocked to my foundations i spent an evening talking to him about christo buddhism
5263172 i wouldnt put it past him but i dont know that as a fact
5263173 one day she walked in looking especially world weary and bayed out to no one in particular has anybody got a plaaaastic lemon in that great the end voice liz and i had to leave the building to do a little dance of delight outside
5263174 she comes in the office to wait to be picked up by the road crew the vans running late shes sat reading this book she keeps bursting out laughing nico what are you reading thats so funny and she says bleeeak houuuuse
5263175 he just used to sit in the corner ogling linder starstruck
5263176 in those days morrissey was a bit like zelig he was present at all these major events at the russell club at the new hormones offices but no one noticed him
5263177 he was in and out the office quite a lot because he was big mates with linder
5263178 he gave me a cassette of him singing very quietly fragments of songs and im sure some lyrics ended up on reel around the fountain and the hand that rocks the cradle and there was a bessie smith song a blues called wake up johnny and the trope which i quote myself on endlessly is a couple of months later johnny knocked on morrisseys door and woke him up
5263179 he would kill me if i put it on ebay
5263180 i would stand at the door at the end of the gigs selling product when people were leaving id be doing this whole spiel did you like the show do you wanna buy the album now rather than think about buying it in rough trade several weeks later when youve forgotten it was another intervention
5263181 the thing i remember most vividly about one of our i like shopping tour gigs at the 101 club at clapham junction was believing that wed got our first ever ovation from the 25 or so punters whod attended getting really excited seeing the audience surging towards us preparing ourselves for an encore and then realising that in fact it was not us but a couple who were acting rather over amorously on the steps down to the toilets that everyone was pushing and shouting to look at
5263182 linder and ian didnt really think the other bands were in the same league as ludus
5263183 all the other bands got on very well with each other and indeed with me
5263184 little in the way of competition or hostility we often shared back line gear with ludus
5263185 i remember playing bass with dislocation dance because paul couldnt make a tv appearance
5263186 theyd be out the front cheering us and wed be cheering them it was all very friendly
5263187 i just liked the idea of these people stepping out of their normal way of working to see how they reacted to it
5263188 it was like having a house band except we didnt have a studio like berry gordy
5263189 they all liked each other and they all appreciated what each other was doing
5263190 we had shown allegro non troppo at the beach club and i was just smitten by that whole scene
5263191 the recording session was the first time i got lawrence diagram andy playing trumpet it nearly killed him recording that dids played drums and we just put a loop of that as the snare loop before samplers or anything it was probably an 8 foot tape reel and we had to stand there with a drumstick trying to keep the tension right all the way through and we just built over that the trumpet and the snare
5263192 it was the walkman era cassettes were the format of the moment
5263193 bloke from manchester with an idea that needed to come to fruition
5263194 there was a guy in australia did an audio magazine it may have had an influence on shaun
5263195 didnt know about any australian equivalent there was a much more polished commercially produced cassette zine that appeared around that time in the uk called something like sfx but i dont think that had yet come out when i started to produce nl
5263196 what i can remember about northern lights is there being boxes of it in the office
5263197 i mean youve got bits of talk bits of music and its all a bit random
5263198 except there was nothing underneath it didnt really build any foundations
5263199 i used to visit joy division when they were rehearsing in a room above a pub in the bus depot in weaste and for some reason i just said ian lets go for a drink because i thought he was bright and brilliant and interesting and driven and northern we would go for a drink would he mind if i interviewed him and he said no problem
5263200 it was just a thing between mates most things were things between mates
5263201 so you have the whole joke of radio sweat its nicely put together youve got linders work which was a musical work and a visual work put together biting tongues im sure we were supposed to do some text thing but didnt because probably ken hollings didnt deliver it wasnt just supposed to be the live it cassette
5263202 over 20 minutes of songs instrumentals for close and casual listening
5263203 as a natural progression of early photomontage i wanted to play with photomontaging myself
5263204 cp lee sneaked in one night and we recorded them when i was supposed to be monitoring the stations output
5263205 we did a couple of live gigs dj stuff the mike barnes roadshow actually went out
5263206 the lamplight in chorlton and i think we did rafters as well we had prize giveaways and people were just saying what the fuck richard and i just loved it
5263207 using a small studio but using all of it spending our time layering tapes into the mix
5263208 again it was kind of like heres a bit of money oh weve got four tracks heres another bit of money oh weve got two tracks heres another bit of money its a product
5263209 it was never heres the album this is the concept of the album
5263210 that was supposed to come with a calendar an assassination calendar
5263211 me and nathan mcgough and ambrose did a lot of research at manchester library it was too big a project really for too few people
5263212 rough trade were a bit dubious about the subject matter people being murdered set to music so uncle geoff at rt pulled the plug then richard ran out of money and so it goes
5263213 a few years later i released the mini lp on zulu the label reynolds shared with jayne casey
5263214 once we got to know more about it we had a relationship with rough trade yes we dont just put stuff out we trail it we put out cassettes beforehand with propaganda and interest people pete walmsley who ran rough trades international department said yeah put all that stuff together and itll go out in our mailings
5263215 pop meets jazz meets disco who could ask for anything more
5263216 playing the legendary mudd club was a highlight great great gig just being a young british band in new york having the stones walk through our dressing room before we supported toots at the new york ritz wow
5263217 the whole audience knew the lyrics to all the songs and were singing along
5263218 i met someone when the band was in nyc and then got an offer of a paying job which actually fell through when i got back there
5263219 things were getting pretty tight back in manchester by that time
5263220 pete leaving probably had a bigger impact than the lack of new hormones financing nothing is more important than an effective manager
5263221 wed come to the end of our time at college i had this sense of destiny i had to get a job i was about to get married
5263222 things werent going brilliantly and you dont want things to go sour i think its a bit like doing a set thats too long best to leave everybody on a high note rather than a low note
5263223 reichian therapy screaming birthing therapy you have to love them for that dont you you have to love richard for putting it out
5263224 richard had a contrariness about him that allowed to him see things like danger came smiling as a valid business move where others would have simply viewed such a release as indulgence
5263225 he enjoyed art and allowed it to resonate he really seemed to enjoy its meaning not just its effect or symbolism
5263226 wed talked to cnd and it was supposed to be a fundraiser a little tiny bit of fundraising i got a discount from the pressing plant which was making records brian bonner rough trade waved part of their distribution fee it just didnt sell so it didnt raise any money in the end
5263227 cruisin with santa if you subscribe to conspiracy theories was brilliant
5263228 the records just never arrived i think about 200 300 got through and then it was too late to get any kind of distribution i mean anything that could have gone wrong had gone wrong with it and at the time we were all watch out mi5 it was probably just hopeless speed paranoia at the time it all seemed terribly significant
5263229 when liz and richard were working together to keep the company going my bank manager called me and said ive been having a word with richard he had the same bank manager as me i think you ought to lend him some money
5263230 i was like well im not going to which was sad in a way because maybe that was the end of new hormones i dont know he wanted five grand in those days that was a lot of dead presidents
5263231 morrissey came in saying right weve recorded hand in glove and weve got this live track from the fashion show could i help and i said no because you need more resources than i could possibly possibly offer you need to talk to simon edwards at rough trade distribution
5263232 if you look at what new hormones didnt put out the fall the smiths etc richards very generous with his advice or his enabling of other people to do things and subsequently has been a lot less successful than anybody else
5263233 he really was an important person in manchesters music history
5263234 i couldnt sustain dislocation dance anymore and id done some demos and i took them to geoff travis and he rang me and said oh this is interesting i want to talk to them and i want to talk to you so i went down with them and gwill evans the bands manager after pete wright and they had their meeting with geoff and i used the phone in rough trade bookings office upstairs and then geoff came in and said oh the meeting was alright and i said why did it take you so long to get around to listening to that because i get so much stuff in fact im looking for someone to help me wade through it and im going to america for three months and i said well im up for that
5263235 if im covering for geoff going to america for a couple of months then i might end up back broke in manchester but i didnt i paid two months ahead liz and i packed up all the press releases all this stuff boxes labelled them i told leslie fink the landlord we were packing up wed be going in two months but i paid he threw everything in a skip bastard
5263236 one being a multi track of the worst which is now in the hands of tony barber peters bass player its so old its going to need to be baked for a weekend or something tonys going to hopefully bake it see if theres anything salvageable and he and i might do something with it then i could finally put out the worst record ever but it might destroy their myth theyre more mythical by having nothing available they were great lads the worst they really were that post pistols just go and do it and they did and they were crap but they were brilliant sings put you in a blender put you in a blender
5263237 my big regret is not putting out clamour club by gods gift
5263238 it was just great punk rock gods gift belong to the secret public
5263239 would have loved to do something with basil from yargo he walked into the office one day and said i want to be produced by thom bell fantastic he had ambition with the last 90 quid of new hormones money i stuck him in a four track
5263240 there are some good local bands boon lives in stoke newington they need a local record label n16 records but im not doing it i keep encouraging people i dont want to do that i feel as if ive retired and ive got a job which i like
5263241 he gave me a copy of nick drakes pink moon as a birthday gift the message which i didnt really pick up was thats where you should be going you should be a cross between nick drake and burt bacharach
5263242 i turned up quite early in the morning and richard hadnt started them yet he was still laying them out and basically hed taken an old copy of search and destroy and had just cut out these old african tribal marking pictures and i think there was an eye surgery one as well and he was still doing all this letraset but really quickly really efficiently taking an a4 sheet and putting the flyer on it putting it through the xerox machine and guillotining it and i think i was only in the office for 20 minutes and by the time he had finished i had a thick wad of flyers in fact the opening lines to reflector were inspired by the flyer the filed down teeth so there was a lot of energy as well
5263243 richard was really a vital glue conceptually for everybody i think from him came that sense of its a creative house and i support you in your creative stuff
5263244 he was so clearly committed to the idea of the creative part of it that actually money hardly got discussed at all
5263245 richard detested business it wasnt him really he was more into the creative side
5263246 dislocation dance were hugely underrated they had some wonderful songs and a very forward presentation with nice girl boy vocal appeal
5263247 they could have been a big pop band they were good songwriters
5263248 our ideas were bigger than our budgets partly a product of our influences
5263249 i wanted to do plausible american cop show themes savannah band swing and bubble gum parodies it would have been easier to have just been a guitar band
5263250 with a little guidance production wise and some direction management wise we had the makings of something special
5263251 if they hadnt spent two hours sitting around discussing hand held in black and white by dollar and was this culturally significant
5263252 you have an artist who sells and makes enough money for you to do all the fringe peripheral stuff geoff travis could sell a load of aztec camera and sell 4 000 robert wyatt on the back of it daniel miller had depeche which meant mute could put out diamanda galas tony had joy division
5263253 i suppose because we were slightly ahead of them if thered been more means buzzcocks could have been new hormones act
5263254 i probably treated them as if they were even though they were on ua
5263255 no because he was going to be the figurehead for genetic with homosapiens genetic was producer martin rushents indie within island no there was a lot of acrimony some directed at me but a lot at emi
5263256 all the people wed relied on at ua had gone and there was no one at emi who was interested emi took over ua in 1980 and there was no money and touring america had cost a lot of money the tour support that was supposed to be guaranteed was never paid nothing was happening and martin rushent said to pete ill get you out of here for a bit get out of this mess because it was very messy
5263257 i probably would have said no had they done so
5263258 everyone got on another aspect of the secret public it was the secret entrepreneurs people helped each other and if someone had a hit good for them
5263259 postcard fast new hormones doesnt fit in with any of those labels
5263260 people were very respectful of richard and the buzzcocks but as a label it never quite captured peoples imagination
5263261 maybe new hormones as a label was a little bit too diverse
5263262 the bands were diverse even though a lot of the bands shared the same producer there was no signature sound necessarily the artwork didnt have a unified style even though they were more of a family it wasnt perceived as that
5263263 peter wright was more vocal about things than richard boon but there wasnt a pr department to the label it was very much hearsay it was enough to put the records out
5263264 i think it would be really pompous to assume that anybody was influenced by us
5263265 but that zeitgeist sound noisy discordant stuff im amazed how acceptable it is now
5263266 i am proud of our output and know that we were listened to sometimes by supporting bands that went on the have greater success such as china crisis omd and mick hucknall
5263267 sometimes there was a lack of quality control but what he was striving towards was really amazing
5263268 i see music as organised noise ive never come out of seeing music that way
5263269 there are a lot of bands showing bits of the kind of thing we were doing
5263270 new hormones represented an ethos that was then taken up by big flame and the floating adults
5263271 it was just that this music should be heard and these players should be paid attention because they have hopefully something to say or they are making an interesting racket i like interesting rackets there wasnt an overarching ideology i didnt want to be ahmet erteg n or anything like that
5263272 richard boon describes himself as a survivor of the punk wars but hes a hero of those wars too and deserves the equivalent victoria cross
5263273 it was a great adventure set out with that map and see where you land
5263274 if you say one more word i am going to tape your mouth shut
5263275 thank you for teaching me sister have a good weekend
5263276 i havent heard from them in years i wonder how mark is
5263277 the funeral is tomorrow and his parents would like if it you could attend
5263278 they found this on mark when he was killed we thought you might recognize it
5263279 i still have my list its in the top drawer of my desk at home

5263291 enclosed are the latest montages ive done hope you like them im very excited about the idea of doing a magazine i think our work would mix well together if were going to do a 12 page broadsheet size format ie anarchy in ther uk size well need 13 montages i can produce 4 5 right now using old stuff as well by next week ill try and do 2 3 more to give plenty of choice cos dont forget we need one extra for back front covers i dont know about printing costs etc some of them would need screening up from the size theyre at i can provide up to 100 if necessary but maybe richard boon can come up with something between buzzcocks traumas it might be cheaper in manchester too should be black and white shown your montages to various people rough trade viv goldman judy nylon general verdict is that theyre amazing so there you are new bowie album is beautiful dreamt about it last night post everything music
5263292 punk was cutting out the question can i do this i began to do bits of collage quite naturally i took lots of photographs and wondered what could i do with them i started to get bored and then moved from collage to montage using scalpels glass cutting id always loved magazines and i had two separate piles one you might call womens magazines fashion romance then a pile of mens mags cars diy pornography which again was women but another side i wanted to mate the g plan kitchens with the pornography see what strange breed came out i did it all on a sheet of glass with a scalpel very clean like doing a jigsaw rising above it all
5263293 the knife used was a surgeons scalpel still made in sheffield by swann morton ltd the packets of blades look like condom packets i think we used blade no 11a for our cutting out work
5263294 another music in a different kitchen was a mixture between linder howard and richard we were trying to think up titles for the montages in the secret public and howard said another housewife stews in her own juice in a different kitchen we shuffled it around a bit and it came out like that its like an extension of dada where you get a meaningless phrase and you free associate with that to find out what it actually means and it gets a meaning and then you do the meaning
5263295 the one we eventually found wanted paying in cash without receipt some left wing bookshops wouldnt take tsp because of its content
5263296 i didnt realise it then but the process of montage as the ultimate container of dichotomy has formed an invisible continuum throughout all ive done to date even the return of linderland had the audacity of montage to let ann lee cohabit with clint eastwood old with young faith with nihilism north manchester with the west
5263297 the most self destructive thought that any person can have is thinking that he or she is not in total control of his or her life thats when why me becomes a theme song
5263298 it was a good quarter but i think investors are going to be disappointed by how they see the full year

5263300 the closer in the chain you are to the consumer in japan the more difficult it is to pass on the cost increases as demand is too weak so retailers have no pricing power
5263301 the bank of japan perceives current inflation conditions to be cost push with a strong possibility for it to slow economic growth
5263302 so they dont see the current environment as one in which to raise rates
5263303 at a time when many companies are struggling to cope with the dramatic shifts underway in the north american light vehicle market ricardo continues to see strong demand for its services due to our ongoing drive to apply our engineering expertise to expanding technology sectors
5263304 the experience and insights john brings will be invaluable as we further diversify our business base especially in areas such as military technology and wind and solar power which are experiencing explosive growth as the global demand for energy expands exponentially john will help ensure ricardo plays a vital role in developing more efficient and environmentally friendly energy systems

5263312 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5263313 we are very pleased to have expanded our retail business
5263314 we believe that these acquisitions are another excellent example of the value of our distribution network demand for fuel is high in china and often outstrips supply as such retailers are frequently unable to secure enough supply to sustain operations because we regularly distribute large amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel it is relatively easy for us to secure supply this gives us a considerable advantage versus other retail gas station operators which is why we decided to enter the retail business in our bio diesel business our ability to utilize our existing fuel distribution network to facilitate sales has allowed us to grow rapidly without having to invest significant time and capital into developing a new customer base like the bio diesel market we consider the retail business to be an attractive source of growth for the company and expect to add to our number of stations in the future we will continue to look for ways to utilize all of our assets including our distribution network as we strive to deliver maximum growth and profitability for our shareholders

5263330 see my friend you have illusions about who you are you are running forward all the time but you dont know where you are going your mind and body have formed an unhealthy partnership from which you have excluded me your real self
5263331 for so long i was also bewildered by you but some time ago i found out that i dont need and want what you crave in fact your so called pleasures have often been a diversion from real life and made you and me suffer
5263332 now with my misidentification gone i am no longer yoked to the ups and downs you experience which are fully controlled by the laws of matter i refuse to be a slave to you any longer ill be living my own life
5263333 is that all you wanted to tell me or is there something you want from me
5263334 an excellent question i am grateful to you for asking yes i wish to suggest a program of cooperation that will be beneficial to both of us

5263337 my time is up i have been blessed to be with you only for this long usually maya illusion keeps careful watch trying to keep me away from those like you who live in her prison

5263395 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5263396 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5263397 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about

5263400 i am just on the verge of finishing a script i am working on about the functioning and psychology of media so far you have seen the media exposing things and now i want to expose the media in all its naked glory
5263401 the media has transformed from a truth telling machinery to a power mongering and money making enterprise
5263402 watching with glee someone else fall down and to be ripped to shreds
5263403 they tend to fall in love more with the way they rip the film apart much more than they hate the film
5263404 when they journalists get a certain whiff of an interesting story on someone their greatest fear would be that it will be denied by the person
5263405 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people
5263406 the film people out of their fear and greed and in order to use the media people open their doors to them and almost become informants to the media about the rest of their colleagues in the industry
5263407 media looses its primary objective and tends to get embroiled in the camp culture of the industry
5263408 i dont believe that the media is so dumb it was unintentional and when i wrote the 11 things it was all in good humour i even made fun of myself in the blog why is it being taken further

5263420 we forecast the hepatitis b drug market to grow significantly in the coming years
5263421 clinicians we interviewed expect that indias increasing wealth urbanization and disease awareness will fuel an increase in diagnosis particularly following educational efforts surrounding the inclusion of hepatitis b vaccines into the universal immunization program in 2009
5263422 the general population does not regard hepatitis as a critical disease
5263423 for most people its seen as just normal jaundice they wont understand the treatment or why the clinician is being so sensitive to them

5263433 i spent a week in kings canyon sequoia national park a couple weeks ago during the new moon and came away with two surprisingy amazing time lapse movies of the milky way galaxy traveling across the night sky
5263434 there are 15 people all with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there is an organized effort
5263435 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5263436 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5263437 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution
5263438 i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5263439 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5263440 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5263441 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5263442 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated
5263443 i dont hide it at all we are the ones who are giving this right we gave the right we are paying for old sins for this reason the ioc is indeed chasing us it is a fact that they are chasing us
5263444 treat others as you think they would want to be treated
5263445 part of my and that punk rationale was make things happen make the place that you happen to be living a place that you want to be living in
5263446 we put out a fanzine that says fanzines can be anything you want
5263447 it was play play is very important because its transgressive and transformative
5263448 i was still in the same sort of frame of mind as with tiller boys still quite an aggressive physical sound but using a lot of repetition
5263449 it was said that erics personal energy field caused electrical and electronic equipment to malfunction he had trouble even watching tv

5263452 a typical day at 50 newton street is beyond description it was an open house to derelicts
5263453 alan wise is one of the most bizarre people youll ever ever encounter
5263454 things werent going brilliantly and you dont want things to go sour i think its a bit like doing a set thats too long best to leave everybody on a high note rather than a low note
5263455 richard had a contrariness about him that allowed to him see things like danger came smiling as a valid business move where others would have simply viewed such a release as indulgence he enjoyed art and allowed it to resonate he really seemed to enjoy its meaning not just its effect or symbolism
5263456 it was probably just hopeless speed paranoia at the time it all seemed terribly significant
5263457 richards very generous with his advice or his enabling of other people to do things and subsequently has been a lot less successful than anybody else he really was an important person in manchesters music history
5263458 i would have loved to do something with basil from yargo he walked into the office one day and said i want to be produced by thom bell fantastic he had ambition with the last 90 quid of new hormones money i stuck him in a four track
5263459 richard was really a vital glue conceptually for everybody i think from him came that sense of its a creative house and i support you in your creative stuff richard was so clearly committed to the idea of the creative part of it that actually money hardly got discussed at all
5263460 people helped each other and if someone had a hit good for them
5263461 people were very respectful of richard and the buzzcocks but as a label it never quite captured peoples imagination
5263462 new hormones was important because it was the first independent in manchester if not the uk
5263463 there was no great vision with factory which is odd because factory has this reputation of being a visionary label
5263464 the personae of the bands at factory were certainly subservient to the overarching persona of the label itself with the caveat that joy division and new order really were the persona of the label embodied in vinyl so their visualisation was indistinguishable from factory itself
5263465 if some of the new hormones bands had been on factory and vice versa the world would have been a different place in some ways better
5263466 one tends to think of all the factory bands being quite the same new hormones was definitely a whole mess of individuals which possibly led to its eventual demise
5263467 im really proud to have been signed to new hormones but i sometimes wish id have signed with factory when i had the bloody chance
5263468 new hormones was more of a family thing than factory
5263469 maybe new hormones as a label was a little bit too diverse the bands were diverse even though a lot of the bands shared the same producer there was no signature sound necessarily the artwork didnt have a unified style even though they were more of a family it wasnt perceived as that
5263470 if there was an ethos it was just that this music should be heard and these players should be paid attention because they have hopefully something to say or they are making an interesting racket i like interesting rackets there wasnt an overarching ideology i didnt want to be ahmet erteg n or anything like that
5263471 new hormones was a better label than factory of that i have no doubt not just because of richard boons extraordinary vision he isnt just a music fan in the way that tony wilson was nowt wrong with being a fan of course but because richards vision became the music such was his influence he was the malcom mclaren of the north a truly brilliant man broke but brilliant richard wasnt the sort of individual who would be taken in by the drug fuelled drivel of salford scallies he loved the artform and he loved individuals my conclusion eric random more important than fat boy slim diagram brothers more important than madness ludus more important than well morrisey i suppose as for dislocation dance well i think we could have been more important than new order
5263472 im not bitter about anything actually it was a great adventure set out with that map and see where you land

5263483 today we are all witnesses to the prevalence of peace and security in the state however it is our contention that for peace to be sustained oil companies should see the communities as stakeholders through this job and business opportunities should be made available to the communities and their indigenes

5263501 wal mart broke federal election rules by advocating against democratic candidate u s sen barack obama in meetings with employees
5263502 federal election rules allow businesses to push for specific political candidates to shareholders executives and salaried managers but they prohibit such actions for hourly workers
5263503 to effectively get rid of privacy union bosses can stand over workers shoulders and use coercion its bad enough that workers will lose their right to privacy but it will tilt the whole political spectrum to the left when it comes to labor politics
5263504 its left up to the employer whether or not an election is held they hold all the power they can intimidate workers to force them from forming a bargaining unit its time to bring back the middle class
5263505 everything from television radio and print ads to a youtube page web advertising and a substantial grassroots organizing effort
5263506 its the most important issue in the election to us
5263507 but that doesnt mean we cant continue to run ads that address the issue
5263508 ive heard that from other folks he was intended to be intimidating but the whole card check things is intimidating the question is how do you educate someone in 30 seconds on an issue you can bring a voter to water but you cant make them go further if they dont want to
5263509 and they told me i would be welcomed to buy an ad
5263510 who tie things up to try to prevent us from coming in

5263550 guys like matt wilson and ian macgregor really stepped up today because they want to be part of the team effort
5263551 it kind of shows the depth of this team we dont have the big superstar rider we just have a lot of guys that cling to one another

5263564 im keeping up some with it this year for some reason maybe because there is a black man running
5263565 this is an outside special interest group playing politics with our kids if i had the 435 000 this group is spending on these ads id be funding scholarships for those same children they accuse me of preventing from attending college
5263566 mccain ran a negative ad which is most of the ads he runs that claimed my economic plan was higher taxes and that it would lead to economic disaster
5263567 that is what he said my plan would lead to economic disaster
5263568 well ive got news for john mccain my plan is not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush
5263569 mccains been out there making all these comments and i dont think he did enough in response
5263570 my plan provides tax cuts to 95 percent of the american people
5263571 if you are making 150 000 or less you are going to be getting a tax cut under my plan
5263572 i think his policies are terrible i think his service was admirable
5263573 he always says im a maverick im a maverick im a maverick let me tell you something every single one of his top people are all lobbyists for the very special interests that have been dominating washington all these years
5263574 john mccain has always put country over politics regardless of personal or political consequences which has put him at odds with members of his own party on numerous occasions
5263575 from campaign finance reform to ethics and education john mccain puts the needs of the country above all else
5263576 now with 79 days until the election people need to know where he stands in comparison to john mccain
5263577 thats in comparison with john mccain who is unafraid and incredibly willing to talk to any voter regardless of party affiliation
5263578 people are so excited about barack obama that they really want to see him in person but knowing nevada is a battleground state i know that he will be back in reno and hell put on a larger event for people to see him in person
5263579 add to the conversation because these are concerns shared by everybody
5263580 i think they understand the campaign has moved to a different stage now
5263581 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5263582 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5263583 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5263584 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5263585 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5263586 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5263587 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5263593 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected
5263594 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5263595 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5263596 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5263597 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5263598 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5263599 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened

5263613 the reason theres so much soy in america is because they the soy industry started to plant soy to extract the oil from it and soy oil became a very large industry once they had as much oil as they did in the food supply they had a lot of soy protein residue left over and since they cant feed it to animals except in small amounts they had to find another market

5263641 and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5263642 and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5263643 this is not meant to make the claim that mccain received information relating to warrens questions to obama just that he could have done since the constraints of the cone of silence were not in effect those constraints were pointedly put in place by pastor warren to provide an excplicit safeguard of fairness and it was reported to the audience as such

5263702 why should they not be they both speak european languages and are culturally and historically as european as greece is it is considered relatively likely that armenia is the original homeland of the indo european tribe s which almost all of europe armenia included has linguistic and cultural heritage from azerbaijan on the other hand is ethnically turkic who arent really any more european than the arabs they speak a turkic language and are culturally tied with the central asian turkic cultures
5263703 what do we really mean if we say that europe ends at the caucasus the northern foothills a line connecting the highest points if the latter is true then the northeastern part of azerbaijan is definitely located within europe and possibly some small portions of northern georgia are too i also think a mention should be made of kazakhstan as stated in the article the ural river is part of the european border part of kazakhstan lies to the west of this river and is therefore located in europe

5263943 this budget is being balanced on the backs of the states working people
5263944 an alternative would be to tax the rich and those who can best afford it like the steinbrenners and ratners who are given huge tax breaks that could bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars why does yankee stadium warrant more consideration than the working and middle class people of this state
5263945 as i said last month my goal is to reduce spending in the 2008 09 budget by at least an additional 600 million today i have provided the legislature with over 1 billion in current year savings options as we begin a productive dialogue and work together toward the goal of ensuring the states fiscal integrity
5263946 why do we need to target the poor black and hispanic communities instead of the special interest groups that have lots of money
5263947 as usual no one wants to go after special interest groups to solve these problems the easiest targets to no ones surprise nor concern are funding cuts for medicaid higher education and social services that will have a disproportionate effect on the lives of poor and less fortunate new yorkers
5263948 it is absurd to cut 51 million from cuny and 506 million from medicaid
5263949 come on david we need to tax the rich dont punish the poor
5263950 if we do a millionaires tax we dont have to hurt the poor and working class who are already struggling to make ends meet we could put a 2 5 percent increase on those who make 500 000 a 3 5 percent increase on those who make a million dollars a 5 percent increase on those who make 5 million and a 7 percent increase on those who make 10 million that constitutes 97 000 people which is only 2 5 percent of the population and that will generate 6 5 billion dollars and you dont have to cut anything
5263951 how can you cut health care spending by reducing the monies you give to medicaid thats money provided to hospitals to help struggling working class families why would you cut medicaid and monies for education when you can tax the rich
5263952 on april 1 2009 in just 232 days we will have no other choice but to reduce spending and close a 6 4 billion budget gap and if the economy continues to worsen the spending reductions i have proposed will be necessary to help ensure the current years budget remains in balance either way the longer we fail to act the more painful and limited our choices will be
5263953 just like families across new york facing difficult economic times our state government needs to scrutinize its spending carefully and acknowledge that we simply cannot afford everything we want or everything we counted on when we thought we had more money
5263954 my two cents in helping the governor solve new york states fiscal crisis
5263955 serious fiscal hallenges with our states next budget and has some difficult decisions to make regarding this enormous projected deficit
5263956 if the governor really wants to balance the budget and find some money to fill the gaps diaz announced
5263957 according to the working families party if the governor were to propose a tax surcharge on wealthy new yorkers who make in excess of 10 000 or more per week and eliminate corporate loopholes the state can generate 6 to 7 billion dollars in new tax revenue per year this will pay for middle class and working class tax relief and keep our transit school and health systems in decent repair
5263958 presently when people in new york make purchases with credit cards the credit card companies send the taxes collected and owed to the state back to the merchants instead of sending the money directly to the state why cant the governor force credit card companies to send this money already collected directly to new york state instead of to the merchants
5263959 many food pantries across new york state wisely purchase food at bulk rate saving millions of dollars why cant the governor propose bulk rate medication purchases for institutions instead of catering to the pharmaceutical companies

5264044 we saw a range of all new mainframe clients this year across the world particularly in emerging markets such as china and india
5264045 many companies are facing both space and power constraints in their datacentres and are clamouring for increased datacentre efficiency
5264046 clients want datacentres that are designed for specific processes that can help them consolidate servers and improve their energy efficiency
5264047 the mainframe has been completely redesigned and is as modern if not more modern than any other platform out there
5264048 trusty mainframes are alive and kicking and remain critical components of a companys it infrastructure especially for mission critical high volume transactional environments like financial services where the mainframe has proven itself to be a trusted platform for housing large amounts of data in a secure and centrally managed environment
5264049 we suspect that much of this growth is coming from existing mainframe users who are either upgrading or growing their mainframe usage
5264050 scale up the performance of sophisticated data analysis and other bi functions against larger volumes of data
5264051 bi is still a growing market pushing the software onto the mainframe helps companies to both protect and leverage their mainframe investments that is using bi to drive legacy modernisation without replacement of the mainframe
5264052 classic mainframe myths still exist today mainframes have traditionally been associated with high total cost of ownership lack of advanced applications inability to support real time low latency processing poor back end data integration support a shortage of mainframe skills and steep and inflexible development and maintenance curves
5264053 there are simply not enough young bright people wanting to learn mainframe skills over php java flash and other hip web 2 0 technologies

5264149 os bancos estavam com outra din mica de capta o at 2007 menos dependentes dos cdbs um dos problemas para eles foi o compuls rio sobre o leasing que passou a comprometer parte dos recursos captados nesse segmento com isso passaram nos ltimos meses a oferecer taxas melhores para que os cdbs atra ssem mais aplicadores e conseguissem assim captar mais recursos
5264150 tudo depende do volume que se tem para aplicar e do banco que o cliente buscar mas de um modo geral fato que a remunera o subiu nos cdbs

5264227 i have never had sex with a woman ever i have never deeply kissed a woman before either

5264230 david our fears and phobias are often built of tiny pieces they dont come to us whole in one fell swoop but rather they grow on us as we go from life to life until finally they manifest themselves and the only way to understand these issues is to go back and find each piece until we have a whole picture like a jigsaw puzzle the individual pieces dont make sense until they are all fitted together
5264231 david d a v i d w h e r e a r e y o u

5264252 most of all there was no escaping the fact that if lundqvist doesnt stop everything the rangers still cant win
5264253 yeah the dolans are not much to be proud of i couldnt agree with you more but there is more to a franchise than reducing it to how many cups they have won
5264254 using that philosophy the bruins maple leafs amp blackhawks would be classified as major failures as they have not won a cup in a 121 years collecively we all know that labeling them as unseccessful is highly naive as any 3 of those teams has more identity with the nhl than the isles do
5264255 the rangers amp maple leafs are 1 amp 2 in team value forbes nov 06 meaning they are doing something right selling their product the isles by the way are 24 even the devils are above them at what point does one say that the isles in the biggest market in the world amp still failing to capture an audience are actually the ones being mismanaged but thats on a business level
5264256 if you want to keep it to strictly hockey then i would have to point out the isles wonderful management decisions on luongo palffy mccabe chara berard redden jokinen etc
5264257 basically to sum it all up the point is that you cant judge a team simply by its cup record
5264258 besides 1983 was probably the last time the isles will see a cup amp that was already 24 years ago just give it time amp the resluts will not be any better than the rangers after the same amount of years

5264358 we are used to dealing with traffic collisions where people can die but this is the first of its kind for me there was nothing that could have been done to have saved the people inside

5264394 what are the benefits of assertiveness assertiveness affects many areas of life assertive people tend to have fewer conflicts in their dealings with others which translates into much less stress in their lives they get their needs met which also means less stressing over unmet needs and help others get their needs met too
5264395 aggressiveness tends to alienate others and create unnecessary stress those on the receiving end of aggressive behavior tend to feel attacked and often avoid the aggressive individual understandably over time people who behave aggressively tend to have a string of failed relationships and little social support and they dont always understand that this is related to their own behavior
5264396 passive individuals dont know how to adequately communicate their feelings and needs to others they tend to fear conflict so much that they let their needs go unmet and keep their feelings secret in order to keep the peace passive people aim to avoid conflict by avoiding communication about their needs and feelings but this behavior damages relationships in the long run

5264453 in an attempt to curb crime in mayor sent whips along with invitations to numerous clergy in the city due to his secretary having failed to enclose the letters to be sent with them there was some confusion over what was intended according to mayor he was intending to dress in simple robes and flagulate himself along with the local priests only to be horrified by the discovery of an orgy and bdsm taking place all through the city

5264457 but both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth and let men call on god earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands

5264470 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5264471 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5264472 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5264473 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5264474 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5264475 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5264476 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

5264493 the introduction of podcasts on the bounty com site has enabled us to not only offer our existing audience more ways to consume our content but has helped us reach more people and attract additional sponsorship revenue
5264494 the companys current business models root were developing commercial biological technologies and solutions for the chemical industry in the marketplace we became aware of the growing trends towards sustainable eco efficient solutions using renewable resources we saw a real need and opportunity for the next wave after the use of ethanol as an alternative fuel for bio renewable chemicals there is a strong demand and interest for renewable packaging solutions wal mart market news for example has initiated and pioneered a very strong sustainability initiative that focuses on reducing packaging and adherence to sustainable practices
5264495 we went about developing partners and providers in the supply chain to deliver bio renewable chemicals we met cosan sa market news approximately a year ago cosan is the worlds largest processor of sugarcane ethanol which happens to be 7 8 times more efficient than corn feedstock has significantly less carbon impact and is not a competing food source

5264545 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
5264546 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
5264547 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
5264548 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
5264549 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
5264550 council trading standards teams are already taking a tough stance on shops selling knives to children and carry out regular checks to make sure retailers arent breaking the law
5264551 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law councils arent trying to hoodwink retailers and will only use volunteers who look under 18 there is simply no excuse for selling knives to children and retailers must accept their share of responsibility if we are to keep our streets and our young people safe and free of knives

5264558 hemos mantenido una reuni n yo como presidente del cabildo con todos los ayuntamientos de la gomera porque la situaci n no es nada f cil
5264559 no s lo tenemos que devolver recursos a la comunidad aut noma en funci n de las previsiones de ingresos actuales de acuerdo con el igic y el aiem sino que adem s debemos predisponer los presupuestos para el ahorro porque si no tendr amos unos presupuestos para 2009 absolutamente cargados de una parte de devoluci n de recursos y de merma de ingresos
5264560 no es nada f cil no s lo por las devoluciones de ingresos sino porque tambi n habr que disponer los presupuestos para el ahorro y priorizar las inversiones para poder afrontar la realidad cosa que no ha hecho el gobierno
5264561 el presupuesto del cabildo de la gomera de este a o es de 53 millones de euros de los que ya sabemos que hay que devolver 5 millones de euros y tambi n debemos recortar de aqu a finales de a o otros 5 millones para que el presupuesto de 2009 no sea especialmente restrictivo y podamos atender los servicios m nimos con garant as de seguridad y de calidad
5264562 infl los presupuestos y ocult informaci n o no fue capaz de evaluar con claridad la previsi n de ingresos creando un grave problema a las econom as insulares y municipales del que s lo es responsable el ejecutivo regional
5264563 y sin embargo no se aceptan las soluciones propuestas ni se aportan medidas efectivas que deber an llegar con urgencia
5264564 lo m s actualizada posible al objeto de que cada administraci n pueda valorar la conveniencia o necesidad de adoptar con la suficiente antelaci n las medidas que estime oportunas
5264565 se recauda menos y hay menos para repartir hasta ah todos de acuerdo pero habr que buscar la manera de perjudicar lo menos posible a la poblaci n que es a la que se destinan los ingresos de las corporaciones locales
5264566 lo que no es de recibo es que ante situaciones complicadas nos limitemos a buscar chivos expiatorios sin mirar las consecuencias e intentemos trasladar el problema al estado
5264567 se equivoca al intentar imponer m todos y momentos para solucionar un problema generado por esa instituci n y m s concretamente por el consejero de econom a y hacienda que es quien elabora las previsiones de recaudaci n y los presupuestos de la comunidad aut noma
5264568 debe ser consciente de la necesidad de mantener la inversi n p blica e impulsar la actividad adem s de evitar o contrarrestar la p rdida de empleo
5264569 unas devoluciones millonarias y ni siquiera se acepte cubrir la financiaci n de los planes sectoriales
5264570 supone un duro golpe para el presupuesto de los ayuntamientos que tienen que mantener todos los servicios que vienen prestando con unas condiciones de calidad que sean al menos similares a las que ven an prestando con anterioridad
5264571 por ejemplo hay que tener en cuenta que san sebasti n que es la capital de la isla tendr a que devolver m s de 500 mil euros

5264573 no s lo merman las arcas del cabildo sino tambi n las de los ayuntamientos de la isla lo que l gicamente lleva aparejado un incremento del desempleo y una reducci n de la inversi n p blica

5264590 24 2 not one stone shall be left here these words were literally fulfilled in a d 70 titus the roman general built lare wooden scaffords around the walls of the temple buildings piled them high with wood and other flammable items and set them ablaze the heat from the fires was so intense that the stones crumbled the rubble was then sifted to retrieve the melted gold and the remaining ruins were thrown down into the kidron valley see notes on 22 7 luke 19 43

5264645 we really had to play two games because after a superb first half we went in at 1 1 and then had to do it all again after the break
5264646 i was very pleased with the performance and although there are areas we must still improve we played some fantastic football
5264647 i am very pleased with how we went about it i thought it was a good game and the longer it went on the better we got
5264648 i am disappointed not to win i cant fault the players application or performance we are not going to have easy games the bottom line is that we knew what to expect from them but ultimately it is going to be about what we do ourselves
5264649 it is a team game and everyone played their part we did everything we could to try to win but it didnt quite fall for us

5264747 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognize and know me
5264748 i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
5264749 the example of georgia shows strongly how important the security of poland and the whole region is today
5264750 some may read this article and call it a conspiracy theory
5264751 yes there is a conspiracy its a conspiracy by the neocons with the aim of retaining their control over the worlds leading country and carrying out their plan to establish global hegemony
5264752 hiring a block of bloggers to verbally attack a specific person or promote a specific message
5264753 information strategists can consider clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers or other persons of prominence to pass the u s message
5264754 people do not like to be deceived and the price of being exposed is lost credibility and trust
5264755 covertly as a vehicle for friendly information operations subtly changing the messages and data merely a few words or phrases may be sufficient to begin destroying the bloggers credibility the enemy may reason that the blogger in question has betrayed them and may take down the site and the blogger themselves
5264756 there will also be times when it is thought to be necessary in the context of an integrated information campaign to pass false or erroneous information through the media given the watchdog functions that many in the blogging community have assumed not just in the u s but also around the world doing so jeopardizes the entire u s information effort in these cases extra care must be taken to ensure plausible deniability and nonattribution as well as employing a well thought out deception operation that minimizes the risks of exposure

5264775 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution since the correctness or fallacy of that conclusion has immense implications for public policy and for the future of the biosphere we thought it appropriate to present a debate within the pages of p amp s concerning that conclusion
5264776 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
5264777 obamas story of his fathers life is dense presented in anything but a straightforward manner often glorified or embellished so as to mask much of the harsh and for obama probably painful truth
5264778 at the time i just saw that life at home became very difficult the old man never spoke to roy or myself except to scold us he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food ruth became very bitter at how the old man had changed finally roy just left he just stopped coming home and started living with different people so i was left alone with the old man sometimes i would stay up half the night waiting to hear him come through the door worrying that something terrible had happened then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed i would be so sleepy i wouldnt understand anything he was saying secretly i began to wish that he would just stay out one night and never come back
5264779 now as i sat in the glow of a single light bulb rocking slightly on a hard backed chair that image had suddenly vanished replaced by what a bitter drunk an abusive husband a defeated lonely bureaucrat to think that all my life i had been wrestling with nothing more than a ghost
5264780 your fathers first wife he had told me they were separated but it was a village wedding so there was no legal document that could show a divorce

5264788 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5264789 we have to do what we can to reassure other nations in the region that we will try to assist them in maintaining their independence

5264794 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

5264798 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5264799 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5264800 this coalition will build a reform constituency so that public sector groups for reforms can join hands with church groups non government organizations civil society and students
5264801 the victory of among ed mayor robredo and gov padaca showed that people looking for reforms look beyond the candidates of the traditional political parties
5264802 our per capita income has not increased in the last 20 years
5264803 the issues we were raising 20 years ago when we were still students are still being raised by the students today this means nothing has moved
5264804 if we leave things as they are i am not optimistic of genuine reforms after 2010 there will only be a change in administration but no reforms the reform coalition will give a message of hope in getting the country out of this mess
5264805 that attempt failed because there was no reform constituency formed around it things will be different in 2010
5264806 the raising of issues is not the voters function but the candidates and the candidates message had always been the same vote for me
5264807 in 2007 only four of the 12 big spenders won television exposure alone will not make a candidate win

5264809 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
5264810 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
5264811 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
5264812 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264813 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
5264814 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
5264815 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
5264816 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
5264817 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
5264818 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
5264819 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
5264820 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
5264821 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264822 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
5264823 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
5264824 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
5264825 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
5264826 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
5264827 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
5264828 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264829 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
5264830 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
5264831 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
5264832 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
5264833 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
5264834 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
5264835 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
5264836 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264837 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
5264838 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
5264839 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
5264840 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
5264841 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
5264842 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
5264843 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
5264844 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
5264845 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264846 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
5264847 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
5264848 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264849 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
5264850 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
5264851 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264852 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264853 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
5264854 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
5264855 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
5264856 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
5264857 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264858 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5264859 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5264860 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5264861 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5264862 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264863 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
5264864 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264865 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
5264866 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
5264867 the united states is very keen that india become important
5264868 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
5264869 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
5264870 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
5264871 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
5264872 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
5264873 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264874 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5264875 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5264876 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5264877 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5264878 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
5264879 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
5264880 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
5264881 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
5264882 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
5264883 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
5264884 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264885 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
5264886 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
5264887 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
5264888 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
5264889 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
5264890 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
5264891 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
5264892 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5264893 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
5264894 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
5264895 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5264896 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5264897 i will live and die in pakistan there is no other way

5264901 bicycle sales in the netherlands are up at about the same prices the turnover in the past two years and the first quarter of this year has grown this is evident from mondays figures of the central bureau of statistics cbs
5264902 in 2006 turnover increased compared to the previous year by as much as 15 percent in 2007 it was again achieved this time by 9 percent
5264903 in total according to the rai last year 1 4 million new bikes sold nearly 80 000 units more than a year earlier
5264904 the first quarter of this years turnover was more than 3 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier that bodes well for the second quarter because according to the cbs traditionally its the best selling period for bicycle shops
5264905 although the prices of bicycles have predominantly remained at the same level more expensive bicycles have clearly become more popular
5264906 the high fuel prices according to the cbs do not affect bicycle sales
5264907 distances up to 10 kilometers will be cycled beyond that people still prefer the car
5264908 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5264909 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5264910 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up
5264911 after reviewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies and on their advice i have decided to resign
5264912 realistic decision in view of the way things were unfolding
5264913 the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed
5264914 i am sure they would assess the speech of musharraf the consequences and repercussions and they would also keep in mind the political developments in the country and reach a decision
5264915 it is a victory of democratic forces today the shadow of dictatorship that prevailed for long over this country has been removed
5264916 nothing can be proved against me this much confidence i have in me but i think this is not the time for individual bravado this is the time for serious thought
5264917 in the interest of the country i have decided to resign the resignation will reach the national assembly speaker shortly
5264918 now they want to impeach me are they afraid of my constitutional powers impeachment and chargesheet is parliaments right to give a reply is my right
5264919 no chargesheet can stand against me no charge can be proved against me i have this much confident in myself because i have not done anything for myself whatever i have done i have done for pakistan its people whatever the chargesheet i have no fear
5264920 but questions arise as to what impact the impeachment will have on the country whether the country will descend into further instability and confrontation whether the office of presidency should come under pressure should it come under impeachment procedure
5264921 the dignity of the office of the president will be affected the countrys dignity will be maintained
5264922 last year we had a few people and were hoping this year we get more
5264923 theres a lot of people that are saying they want to be there and theres a lot of relatives coming and they want to be there for the send off its kind of a tradition to see family members off its nice to see them off and wish them luck

5264925 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5264926 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5264927 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5264928 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5264929 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5264930 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5264931 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5264932 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5264933 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5264934 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5264935 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5264936 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5264937 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5264938 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

5264941 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5264942 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5264943 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5264944 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5264945 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5264946 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5264947 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5264948 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5264949 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5264950 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5264951 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5264952 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5264953 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5264954 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5264955 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5264956 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5264957 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5264958 ini berarti jumlah pengangguran akan mencapai lebih dari 2 juta orang untuk pertama kalinya sejak partai buruh berkuasa pada tahun 1997
5264959 i could see across the river this convoy of law enforcement cars
5264960 the officers had to handcuff her and haul her off in an ambulance

5264992 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5264993 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5265013 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5265014 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5265015 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road

5265017 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5265161 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5265162 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5265165 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5265166 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5265167 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect

5265169 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5265170 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5265296 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5265297 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5265298 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5265299 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5265300 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5265301 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5265302 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5265303 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5265304 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5265305 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5265306 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5265307 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5265308 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5265309 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself

5265320 it is my 19th year of doing this and you never get used to it but it certainly brings the excitement back to the campus
5265321 i think its extremely important to start the new year off on a good tone i think it sets kind of the standard kind of what were looking for for the whole year it gets the students excited it gets the students motivated to be at shepherd
5265322 the fact that were building programs rather than cutting programs that were really going after retention initiatives and i think just the morale on campus is very important
5265323 i think theres a really good sense of optimism on the campus
5265324 our farmers just dont have the confidence that they can make a living selling vegetables we have some challenges with the length of time were in the market due to the length of time we have fresh vegetables

5265407 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
5265408 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
5265409 keeps to the concept of putting peoples interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
5265410 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law
5265411 were being inconvenienced a little but its nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in china experience for their faith in jesus christ
5265412 when you come here and you sit down and look a girl and a boy in the eye and you have a conversation with them it becomes a lot more personal
5265413 it really teaches you that things that we think really matter at home dont like people get mad because there is a long starbucks line it really dont doesnt matter
5265414 people send money a lot and they go and wear their tuxedos and they sign their checks and feel thats it that will cover it
5265415 its the first time in my life i have done something worthwhile instead of saying my name is bond or my name is simon templar a british tv character he played

5265420 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5265421 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5265422 la mayor a de los pacientes descubren que tienen hepatitis c cr nica cuando van a donar sangre o se van a hacer un examen cl nico para obtener un seguro
5265423 alrededor de un tercio de las personas con hepatitis cr nica avanzar hacia la cirrosis de h gado
5265424 s lo del 5 al 10 desarrollar c ncer de h gado en otras palabras muchas personas pueden vivir perfectamente con la infecci n cr nica sin mayores inconvenientes el problema es que no se puede saber a qui n le va a ir bien y qui n morir de la enfermedad
5265425 usualmente puede hacer que los pacientes reciban el interfer n y la ribavirina durante dos o tres meses m s all se hace realmente dif cil dice el doctor hoofnagle por lo menos al 10 por ciento de los pacientes les es imposible completar la terapia

5265429 economics are the method the object is to change the soul
5265430 she sees her mission as nothing less than eradicating labour party socialism as a political alternative
5265431 regardless of who borrowed the money these debts must be repaid and repaying them in turn means that a nation must agree to restructure its economy the way bankers bid by deregulating privatizing and cutting spending
5265432 liberalism as we know it arose out of a compromise between left wing social movements and business interests it depends on the efficient functioning of certain organs of the state it does not call for all out war on private industry
5265433 economics are the method the object is to change the soul

5265435 he has caused immense harm to islam he has even instigated the pakistani army against his own people
5265436 despite their ineptitude in a lot of other areas and how poor they are at governing one of the things the bush administration has been very good at is using administrative mechanisms to control policy outcomes
5265437 i have worked on regulatory issues inside the beltway since 1976 and have watched five presidents come and go
5265438 the bush administration is the most hostile and aggressive toward these agencies by a couple of orders of magnitude making the reagan era look relatively benign
5265439 no matter who is elected in november it will take years to repair this damage
5265440 politics is injected and elevated into decisions where science and rational judgment should prevail
5265441 politics supersedes scientific and technical information that is critical to protecting our environment and health and safety at home and in the workplace
5265442 many of the politicization scandals in this administration came from cases where unqualified or inexperienced people got into key jobs often with the power to hire others or control information flows
5265443 despite the presidents promise to bring business like thinking to the federal government the bush administration has overseen or at least permitted a significant expansion of both the height and width of the federal hierarchy
5265444 there have never been more layers at the top of government nor more occupants at each layer
5265445 weve been particularly concerned that some of the scientific community is being co opted by political manipulation and that policy is being presented as fact
5265446 the power to coordinate information collection and to review proposed final regulations in a policy office of the white house made omb the equivalent of a political censor over agency actions
5265447 protect his right to select appointees based not only on their managerial prowess but also on their commitment to his policy agenda and their ability to advance articulate and defend it
5265448 one of the things this administration is going to be most known for is that they provided a lot of special access for business interests
5265449 theyve allowed an unprecedented level of involvement by private interests in creating political policy with regard to regulation with regard to rules their energy policy their greenhouse gas policy all of that

5265463 in the last four years he has been built into almost a superman figure here in china
5265464 the hope and expectation of the chinese people that he would win gold has been a very big part of the olympic narrative here
5265465 i think it will take a little while for the chinese people to adjust to this reality

5265522 the city of philadelphia is making a concerted effort to encourage the hiring of ex convicts amid a renewed interest nationwide in dealing with high recidivism growing crime rates and exploding prison populations
5265523 on his 100th day in office last month mayor michael nutter announced a program being headed by an ex offender that gives 10 000 a year in municipal tax credits to companies that hire former prisoners and provide them tuition support or vocational training
5265524 the scope of the ex offender problem in philadelphia was detailed in a report last fall that showed about 40 000 former inmates return to the city annually from federal state and local incarceration
5265525 at any given time according to the study by the university of pennsylvanias school of social policy and practice the city of 1 4 million is home to 200 000 to 400 000 ex cons many in need of not only jobs but also education health care and addiction counseling
5265526 in april president bush signed the second chance act which authorizes more than 330 million over two years to help government agencies and nonprofit groups lower recidivism
5265527 additionally the second chance act enhances drug treatment mentoring and transitional services for ex offenders through partnerships with local corrections agencies and faith based and community organizations
5265528 in the first two years of pri more than 12 800 offenders have enrolled in the prisoner reentry program more than 7 900 offenders have been placed in jobs only 18 percent of those enrolled in the program have been arrested again within one year

5265569 those people who live in black hollow dont read the news they are the news now we never though of ourselves like that
5265570 now for the story do you remember the small flat cars that the railroad used to carry material on not the ones with the hand pumps to make them go they were just 4 wheels with a wooden bed on them a bunch of us appropriated that is a word i picked up in the marines as a marine we never stole anything we just appropriated things anyway after borrowing the cart we would push it up the railroad in back of the old blast furnace at the end of rockwood avenue by the way that was a lot of hard work that we would not have been willing to do if someone would have paid us we would get on and ride it until it stopped which would usually be way down past where wal mart is today the only way to stop it was to put a piece of wood between the boards on the bed and force it against the wheels well it would take a mile to get it stopped someone thought it might be pretty bad if we were crossing a railroad and street crossing at the same time a car or truck would be crossing it was dark and they would have no way of seeing us coming so we rigged up a car battery and a headlight so we could turn it on when we were near a crossing thank god we never had to use it we would put the car back on the side track each night after we used it and i dont think the railroad ever knew what we were doing i know there had to be a bunch of guardian angels breathe a sigh of relief when that bunch got interested in girls and changed their ways hey we were just young and stupid what can i say chester

5265619 if martial law were enacted here at home like depicted in the movie the siege easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical and thats exactly what the clergy response team helped accomplish in the wake of katrina
5265620 c lergy response teams would walk a tight rope during martial law between the demands of the government on the one side versus the wishes of the public on the other
5265621 for the clergy team one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or to obey the law is the bible itself specifically romans 13
5265622 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution
5265623 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
5265624 t he right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
5265625 no free man shall ever be de barred the use of arms the strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
5265626 the great object is that every man be armed everyone who is able may have a gun
5265627 the said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms

5265634 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always whether i win or lose the impeachment the dignity of the nation would be damaged the office of the president harmed even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed
5265635 theres a great myth that the republican party has propagated that theyre good for defense better for defense than the democratic party and that theyre good for veterans and in fact nothing could be farther from the truth
5265636 we have suffered eight years of significant underfunding and underfocus from this administration and my great fear is that senator mccain would continue that process
5265637 id like to address this last assault on veterans and the benefits that we have promised every man and woman who have served in the armed forces of the united states this senator mccain initiative and comment that he submitted to a town hall meeting that we needed to ration health care to veterans is absolutely bankrupt thinking
5265638 and i have served with too many soldiers and i have witnessed too many dramas in the soldiers lives and that of their families the last thing we need to do is ration health care under the guise that were only going to give it to men and women who have been injured in direct combat i dont know how you categorize that and define that issue but it does once again back up the bush administrations approach to underfund the veterans administration and to underserve the veterans who have fought so well for this country
5265639 i have a friend who actually lost his leg in a training incident so if were to ration health care to only combat veterans we would be saying to him that his service where he lost a leg in a training incident where an artillery round went off to close to him his service isnt good enough because he got wounded before he went to combat it wasnt his choice not to go to combat he got wounded in an accident training to go to combat and we cant tell people that just because they didnt go to combat they dont need care its the veterans affairs hospital veterans administration not the combat wounded hospital
5265640 i was in the army for 11 years i was in iraq and afghanistan i was injured in iraq ive been fighting for veterans benefits and veterans rights for a long time sen mccain has a pattern of trying to fix veteran issues by cutting corners plain and simple
5265641 the webb hagel gi bill is a good example of that sen mccain was opposed to the bill from day one now that bill passed both the house and the senate which is great news under that bill i would be able to go to college while getting a stipend and having the va pay for all of my books all of my labs sen mccain tried to introduce a bill that would have just given the old montgomery gi bill a little bit of a bump and people would have had to stay in service for anywhere from 6 to 12 years to get that
5265642 lifetime voting record from the disabled american veterans for john mccain is 39 percent and for barack obama its 89 percent i think that will surprise a lot of americans and disappoint a lot of veterans
5265643 the iraq and afghan war veterans give john mccain a
5265644 i think despite his service distinguished service to our country his political record on veterans has been out of touch and often wrong
5265645 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5265646 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5265647 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5265648 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5265649 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5265650 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5265651 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5265652 hundreds or even thousands of dollars that the government owes you
5265653 we homed in on what is probably peoples prevailing motivator at times which is greed
5265654 he still asked whether or not he could use his stimulus check to help bail himself out of jail that day we informed him that that was not going to work terribly well
5265655 im just so impatient to help the american people solve their problems
5265656 so then i realize well i wish id gone last and then i would have known
5265657 im stupid that way i thought that when they asked what your biggest weakness was they asked what your biggest weakness was and now i know that my biggest weakness is i like to help old ladies across the street
5265658 that for all the noise and anger that so often clouds the discussion about immigration in this country america has nothing to fear from our newcomers they have come here for the same reason that families have always come here in the hope that here in america you can make it if you try
5265659 it will come if we fail to recognize the humanity of cristina and her family if we withhold from them the same opportunities we take for granted

5265680 in the old days it was expected that about half the children in a family would die before they grew up this involved pain illness and sorrow to the mother often great suffering to the children and a waste of natural resources in the care of children who never lived to become productive
5265681 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5265682 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5265683 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5265684 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5265685 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
5265686 realistically there are problems with such a new circuit but the same would be so even for a permanent facility
5265687 the important thing is that there was the will to address the problems and we knew how to do it
5265688 now that the xfp electric loopback and xfp host test board products have been successfully released we will focus our engineering efforts on the development of an sfp electric loopback and sfp host test board
5265689 live like you were dying and we just sat in the living room and played people crammed in some sat on the stairs going up to the second level they had bar b que and drinks and it really was a great time
5265690 damn you and the likes of you to the bowels of hell you ignorant racist bastard
5265691 as a proud american im delighted that the surge has worked so we can move forward with my timetable for withdrawal look if id known how successful it was going to be i would have voted for it at the time it didnt seem like a good bet but prognosticators go broke in wartime
5265692 we dont know what would have happened if i if the plan that i put forward in january 2007 to put more pressure on the iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation to begin a phased withdrawal what would have happened had we pursued that strategy

5265695 excuse me but can you tell me why you have that string right there
5265696 not everyone is so observant that consulting firm i mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest room by tying this string to the tip of you know what we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands shortening the time spent in the rest room by 76 39 per cent
5265697 after you get it out how do you put it back
5265698 the restaurants owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes after several months of analysis they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour if our staff are better prepared we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man hours per shift
5265699 these records are the only surviving source of personnel information on members of the constabulary in ireland 1816 1922 although it gives only basic information it is often an invaluable tool given the lack of alternative genealogical sources
5265700 yes were still here and working hard on getting alan wake for you to enjoy
5265701 if everything had gone perfectly smoothly there probably would be a game out for you guys to play already but designing a completely new game can be hard and sometimes you need to take a detour to find the best route forward
5265702 transport for londons cycling pages are invaluable for everyone that cycles in the capital and making the pages more interactive is a superb idea i will certainly be logging on to check out the tips of fellow cyclists and may well contribute a few nuggets of wisdom myself
5265703 cycling is a fantastic way to get around london but if youre getting started or if youre thinking of riding to an unfamiliar part of the capital it can be tricky to work out the best way to get somewhere or where to park once youve arrived
5265704 i dont think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president
5265705 it doesnt take a great deal of effort to get shot down
5265706 if you look at what hillary clinton has done during her time as the first lady of the united states her travel to 80 countries her representing the u s abroad plus her years in the senate i think shes the most experienced and capable person in the race

5265712 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5265713 the laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature
5265714 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5265715 there are children in that school as young as kindergarten age
5265716 in the gun free school zones act of 1990 congress made it a federal offense
5265717 in 1928 the communists initiated their drive toward world domination when they adopted the
5265718 throughout the 1990s womens magazine became focused less on fashion and more on features about violence against women and children even though crime statistics were plummeting across the country
5265719 in almost all of the stories the message was the same we have a big problem
5265720 all men are unfaithful rats abusive monsters dishonest scumbags or all of the above
5265721 to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them

5265735 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5265754 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5265755 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5265758 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5265759 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5265760 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5265761 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5265762 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5265763 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5265764 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5265765 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5265766 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5265767 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5265768 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5265769 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5265770 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5265771 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5265772 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5265773 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5265774 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5265775 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5265776 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5265777 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5265778 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5265779 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5265780 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5265781 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5265782 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5265783 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5265784 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5265785 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5265786 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5265787 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5265788 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5265789 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5265790 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5265791 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5265792 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

5265795 hes very excited people in phoenix are going to be very happy hes going to be a very good player for several years the suns fans are getting an excellent player and should be very excited because hes playing great basketball and hes a great young man
5265796 think of all the nba players that went the opposite direction this summer
5265797 it was very important hes like a top 10 pick
5265798 when i was a kid it was my dream to play in the nba and its come true
5265799 hes lefthanded and very athletic he attacks the rim with a sort of abandon and is polished with a good feel of the game he could be erratic as a shooter but is mechanically sound and we feel we can work with him on the rest
5265800 when you come here and you sit down and look a girl and a boy in the eye and you have a conversation with them it becomes a lot more personal
5265801 it really teaches you that things that we think really matter at home dont like people get mad because there is a long starbucks line it really dont doesnt matter
5265802 people send money a lot and they go and wear their tuxedos and they sign their checks and feel thats it that will cover it
5265803 its the first time in my life i have done something worthwhile instead of saying my name is bond or my name is simon templar a british tv character he played

5265810 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5265811 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5265812 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5265813 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5265814 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5265815 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5265816 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5265817 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5265818 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5265819 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5265820 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5265821 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5265822 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5265823 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5265824 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5265825 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5265826 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5265827 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5265828 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5265829 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5265830 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5265831 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5265832 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5265833 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5265834 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5265835 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5265836 today in line with the plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers has begun
5265837 para 2009 planejamos suporte para outros mercados fora dos eua e em outros trechos do espectro
5265838 uma daquelas situa es do ovo e da galinha j que depende do desenvolvimento de redes o alcance da cobertura e a demanda existente
5265839 la falta de libertad de expresi n en china est teniendo algo de repercusi n en la prensa pero qu pasa con la represi n que sufren en nuestro pa s los que piensan diferente el disenso es esencial para el funcionamiento de una sociedad democr tica no hay momento m s importante que este momento
5265840 puede englobar cosas como hacer fotos o tomar notas la definici n es muy amplia
5265841 no est claro qui n est realmente al mando y qu normativa se aplica a la informaci n que est siendo recopilada compartida y distribuida a trav s de estos centros de fusi n
5265842 m s all de sus funciones regulares de velar por el cumplimiento de la ley y los polic as se empiezan a convertir en recopiladores de informaci n de inteligencia contra grupos de manifestantes los informes que hemos obtenido dejan claro que no hab a indicio de ning n tipo de actividad criminal y sin embargo la investigaci n prosigui durante 14 meses y los informes fueron volcados a una base de datos federal cuando se autoriza a todas estas agencias a salir a la calle y comenzar a recopilar toda esa informaci n y guardarla en lugares accesibles para los servicios de inteligencia se trata de una un asunto muy peligroso para nuestra democracia
5265843 reinvert a el presupuesto policial en gastos destinados a mejorar la seguridad real de la comunidad nuevas escuelas primarias asistencia m dica para los que no tienen seguro de salud proporcionar energ a limpia y renovable
5265844 los d lares de nuestros impuestos se usaron para pagar a gente que se infiltr y tom notas en nuestras reuniones y eso es algo absolutamente indignante gran parte de la financiaci n de la seguridad nacional es una farsa se est empleando realmente para aplastar a los que piensan diferente no para garantizar de verdad nuestra seguridad
5265845 when he thought it would benefit him norm coleman was very close to george bush and now that its clear that those chickens are coming home to roost norm coleman is running as fast as he can from george bush and from the republican party
5265846 we may have started out on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
5265847 if you voted for me you have much more in common with sen obama than you do with sen mccain
5265848 things are starting to slow down for me i got a lot more experience from last year leading up into this year i came into camp in 2006 without any experience so this year i am feeling pretty good
5265849 we like to fly around we like to hit people well see when the games start how we handle adversity but so far everything has been going real good
5265850 me and chad pennington were going back and fourth and it was like a mind game
5265851 we were pleased with what john did last year based on no playing experience in the nfl
5265852 the distance he covered from saginaw valley state to playing in the nfl was quite large he was strong with how he handled our game plans and his game management
5265853 you look to gain respect from your teammates but sometimes it is hard when you are a young guy now i feel like guys respect me after what i did after last year
5265854 it was a lot different than some of these other guys have played with there was good competition it was one of the top programs in the country i had fun there but it was great to get my degree also
5265855 so theres a gusher of hypocrisy here the state that is the biggest consumer of gasoline in the nation but produces less than 40 of what it uses is opposed to drilling for more oil off its shores were slackers not pulling our weight
5265856 my understanding is that each country is supporting georgia and really doesnt care about georgias population
5265857 non c alcun interessamento per il calciatore del napoli con marino non ne abbiamo mai parlato
5265858 non vero che abbiamo solo sabato c anche alvarez che pu ricoprire quel ruolo ed in alternativa abbiamo anche mister irrera che pu adattarsi
5265859 a sinistra stiamo bene come siamo non abbiamo bisogno di altri rinforzi
5265860 if you want blu ray go get blu ray this product is meant to improve playback of dvds

5265865 liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5265866 if my stinking brothers hadnt sold me into slavery none of this would have happened this is all their fault
5265867 if my stinking cousin hadnt started drinking none of this would have happened this is all her fault
5265868 well what happened last thanksgiving was bad enough but what happened at moms birthday party was even worse and then he called me last week like nothing happened and that made me mad all over again
5265869 why cant joseph just stop playing those games with his brothers and just reveal his identity and welcome them
5265870 i am your brother joseph the one you sold into egypt
5265871 and now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that god sent me ahead of you
5265872 god sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
5265873 you stop focusing on whats wrong with your circumstances and you start focusing on whats right with god if you dont turn your adversity into a ministry then your pain remains your pain but if you allow god to translate your adversity into a ministry then your pain becomes someone elses gain
5265874 much of my life was the pits because of you you threw me into a pit and then you literally sold me out into slavery for twenty pieces of silver in egypt i was falsely accused by my masters wife and was thrown into prison where i stayed for more than two years
5265875 and now do not be distressed and do not be angry for ourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that god sent me ahead of you
5265876 you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives
5265877 father forgive them for they know not what they do
5265878 it started off with eye spasms they were actually seizures and they developed into full fits
5265879 the fits can be controlled with medication but they found a lump on my brain and theres a 50 chance that its causing the epilepsy
5265880 its on the right hand side about halfway up on the frontal lobe
5265881 i would be happy for you to film because i want to sit down and watch it with my girlfriends afterwards
5265882 is there part of the brain responsible for obsession with football and can you can remove it
5265883 but you cant remove it in boys without killing them
5265884 this area here moves the hands and arms this area moves the foot
5265885 and then as i came up behind the cavernoma we found an area here that caused contractions in the face and nearby was an area that was obviously causing eye deviation
5265886 thats interesting because she reports thats her seizures start with eye deviation
5265887 a problem has occured with the disc check the disk

5265891 sproget forandrer sig naturligvis og en ung mand fra skjern taler ikke som sin bedstefar men det er ikke det sam me som at sige at dialekterne er ved at udd for han taler stadig helt anderledes end sine j vnaldrende fra s nderborg eller n stved
5265892 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5265893 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5265894 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5265895 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5265896 freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose
5265897 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5265898 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5265899 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5265900 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5265901 katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
5265902 this is the most exciting football ive been involved in im buzzing and delighted to be here and im loving it
5265903 what makes us possibly prouder of this medal than the athens one perhaps is that we had a big disappointment half way through the event
5265904 that basically ruled out any possibility of winning the gold which is what we were hoping to achieve in fact it almost ruled out any medal so we are proud and relieved
5265905 to have sailed together for 11 years and got fourth at one olympics and then second at the next year means we have been at the front of a very competitive fleet
5265906 im older and wiser and my preparation for this is the best ive ever had
5265907 it wasnt easy but it never is and it went to plan
5265908 iits is not a typical virtual trade show because it showcases offerings of products and services from exhibitors throughout the year and allows buyers and suppliers to connect with one another when its most convenient for them to do so
5265909 it was really hard for me to train and to even get to the olympics
5265910 every day every night youre thinking about it scared that something will happen to your family
5265911 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5265912 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5265913 what that mike and i are splitting up says who tell wfan that contracts contracts contracts you abide by contracts
5265914 he was integral he played a key role he was trusted by others members of this site so much so that he stored horrific images of child abuse on their behalf
5265915 he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5265916 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5265917 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5265918 this was an extremely sensitive and highly complex investigation requiring excellent teamwork between cleveland police the child exploitation online protection ceop centre and the metropolitan police service along with other police forces in the uk
5265919 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5265920 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5265921 there is a simple message for those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or indeed any space on the internet and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images
5265922 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of america when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5265923 mit der ersten wettfahrt sind wir sicher nicht zufrieden denn da sind wir auch vorne gelegen und dann elfte geworden mit der w rde es noch um einiges besser ausschauen wir haben einfach wieder viele punkte verschenkt also ist der tag nicht so ganz positiv aber die zwei dritten sind schon mal nicht so schlecht
5265924 ab platz drei ist das feld von den punkten her ein bisserl zusammenger ckt wir m ssen jetzt mal auf das medal race fahren und dann schauen wir wo wir sind
5265925 ein thema wird sie nach den n chsten drei wettfahrten wenn man da sieht wie es mit den punkten ausschaut k nnen wir dar ber nachdenken
5265926 ein punkt ist sicher dass wir relativ lange gebraucht haben bis wir uns f r das material entschieden haben wir haben das regattatraining ziemlich vernachl ssigt man hat in den ersten wettfahrten gemerkt dass uns die sicherheit fehlt wir haben sehr viele entscheidungen getroffen die nicht aufgegangen sind das ist normal unsere st rke dass wir sehr viel gleich am anfang erkennen wenn winddrehungen sind windst rkeunterschiede das haben wir am anfang nicht gehabt heute war es schon um einiges besser aber das ist schon relativ sp t
5265927 es ist wahrscheinlich die leichtere position als vorne zu sein und zu schauen wer alles hinter uns ist es ist sicher die angenehmere position wir k nnen nur noch nach vorne gewinnen und die anderen nur noch nach hinten verlieren
5265928 die bedingungen sind f r alle gleich im prinzip sind die guten wieder vorne wir haben den fehler gemacht dass wir uns zu sp t auf das regattasegeln konzentriert haben aufs wirkliche wettfahrtsegeln dadurch haben wir viele fehler gemacht die wir normal nicht machen das ist eher uns zuzuschreiben als irgendwem anderen den fehler m ssen wir bei uns suchen
5265929 spa macht es wenn man gewinnt wir waren heute nahe dran das ist zumindest schon mal angenehmer als wenn man hinter allen durchs ziel f hrt

5265940 he was excited that i was called into the poland camp so that gave me a little leverage i finally got myself fit played the last six reserve games but pards said i cant promise youre in my starting team we just decided it was best to part ways
5265941 of course the highlight of la is that beckhams there but for me it was more that i was going to play for a coach that i enjoyed playing football with in the past
5265942 im not going to talk negatively about the galaxy but it was a situation that wasnt as professional as it shouldve been it was very unprofessional on their end i was rushed over there and things didnt transpire and then i was running to this club colorado were never in the picture in the beginning so when i heard they were interested in taking my option i was shocked i was a lot more at ease when rapids coach fernando clavijo spoke to me and when i finally came over here i can honestly say im happy
5265943 you know i love the challenge i want to be the one to make that difference so thats also a big part of why im happy to be here
5265944 i spent two years in england and i wasnt able to get myself fit enough to play but i definitely see myself back there in the future definitely

5265999 there was a widely held perception that the show would fail without ted koppel
5266000 very few people thought the show would survive and even fewer thought it would thrive
5266001 my hope is that we are going to see nightline enter a new golden era

5266014 the pip amba makes developing systems dramatically quicker and easier
5266015 now weve also made acquiring the pip amba quicker and easier with an irresistible price and pretty close to a push button purchase process
5266016 he suits the profile of the type of player we want to bring to the club premier league experience but young enough to improve
5266017 we think hell get great confidence from being a regular player as was the case when jeremie aliadiere was at arsenal he was in the team one week and then out the next so it was very hard to gain confidence
5266018 hes a super athlete hes technically good and from the feedback weve had hes a smashing kid to work with so were very much looking forward to bringing him to our team
5266019 its tough because i was an arsenal supporter but you have to make decisions in football and this is a new chapter in my career arsenal are a great club and hopefully middlesbrough will get to that level too i was a london boy hopefully ill be a north east boy now

5266051 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking

5266055 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms

5266080 mr perzel has been in office over 30 years i feel somewhere along the way he lost sight of the reason he was there
5266081 the reason is to serve the constituents of the 172nd district not to amass personal power at the end of the 30 years whatever he has accomplished he has accomplished if it hasnt gotten done it wont get done
5266082 i think its time to go when you lack ideas and when theres no passion for the job and i have all those things for this job
5266083 but i think hes such a fixture there that he still has to be considered a favorite

5266194 small consideration for the leases but that amount is very small
5266195 at the end of the day the objective is firstly to secure their long term future as bookshops

5266421 the shift towards a market in higher education is inevitably bringing about a consumer culture
5266422 im very happy with the course ive got now but i didnt really see what more i could have done
5266423 if the government wants to go in that direction we are absolutely the right organisation to support the process for doing so
5266424 one of the things we think we could do really well would be to provide entirely independent objective information for individuals to make up their own mind we think we could do that very well and would be happy to do that
5266425 one of the big dangers of allowing people to top up their treatment is that consumers arent informed and they can be susceptible in a moment of crisis to pressure from pharmaceutical companies
5266426 these drugs can be very expensive and i would welcome the provision of a source of independent reliable advice
5266427 the fact that nice are preparing to offer advice shows that the realisation is finally filtering through that you cant withhold information on good drugs which are out there and what they can do even if the nhs cant afford it
5266428 but that has got to be balanced with some sort of mechanism to make sure that people can afford access to these treatments
5266429 any information which is available is obviously valuable but people would have less need to top up if nice did not reject cancer drugs available elsewhere
5266430 it seems that the government is intent on pre empting the outcome of its own consultation on top up payments and that it wants to assist people to buy their own drugs rather than have them provided on the nhs
5266431 but labour are still avoiding two key questions if patients buy top up drugs will that prejudice their access to nhs treatment secondly why is access to new cancer medicines worse in the uk than in the rest of europe and america
5266432 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong

5266600 there is no excuse for what the mccain campaign is doing on the putting america first front there is no way to balance it or explain it other than as evidence of a severe character defect on the part of the candidate who allows it to be used mccain has made a fateful decision he has personally impugned obamas patriotism and allows his surrogates to continue to do that by doing so he has allied himself with those who smeared him his wife his daughter bridget in 2000

5266703 it is advisable to check your roof for the presence of nesting gulls between the months of april and august particularly if there has been such an issue with your property in the past
5266704 it is essential to remove any nest or nesting material as soon as it has been discovered as adult birds will become more protective as they establish their nesting site the adult birds may attack anyone attempting to approach the nest and will call other gulls from the colony to assist
5266705 prompt action to remove any nest and any subsequently rebuilt nests before the eggs hatch and the young birds appear will prevent numerous problems in later months if the gulls are prevented from successfully raising any chicks they are far less likely to return to your property to nest again next year you can contact the councils pest control service through the contact centre on 0131 529 3030 for advice or for a quotation for a nest removal seasonal programme

5266709 step one is to assess the colonys population and make up to provide an accurate baseline thereafter the colony must be monitored for another two or three years to find out how fast its growing its also vital to understand the feeding regimes of the two species where are the major food supplies of the quality necessary for chick rearing most important of all is to get colour rings onto the nestlings to find out exactly how the expansion and migration between colonies works there are lots of questions but its important that we find the answers so it becomes possible to plan a meaningful and sensitive strategy

5266736 as one of the most heavily regulated and complex industries the pharmaceutical sector presents a myriad of unique challenges to organizations during their product development lifecycles and until now few have stepped forward to help
5266737 together conformia and ibm are helping to deliver a clear path for these organizations to follow one that allows them to create an integrated data and information environment resulting in more effective knowledge management programs which they are now demanding
5266738 combining our deep pharmaceutical and biotech expertise with ibms strength in pharmaceutical industry business transformation delivers a groundbreaking new approach to help companies implement new development strategies such as the quality by design paradigm or the ich quality vision this helps solve some of the biggest issues in drug development
5266739 our work with ibm both validates and strengthens our continued dedication to making product development more efficient so scientific leadership can do more with the same resources
5266740 we had another improved quarter materially exceeding prior quarters results this was driven in part by our increased growth in our core subscription revenues and professional service revenues
5266741 subscription revenues are expected to continue rising in the upcoming quarters along with an expected reduction in losses and with several large b2b partnerships scheduled to launch in the next few months we expect our subscriber growth to substantially increase in the fourth quarter
5266742 these are great action titles that will really be incredible to play with the falcon eidos set the bar with the tomb raider and hitman franchises and we look forward to giving our players the chance to experience them

5266749 t boone pickens proposal is reachable only if the government passes the wind tax credit
5266750 the tax credit is really whats driving new windfarm construction in the u s
5266751 on big jobs like this were prepared to help project developers defray some of the costs in regards to recruiting screening and training construction workers that could include bringing in a full time recruiter screening drug testing setting up mobile training units and offering osha 10 hour training classes
5266752 prevention of norovirus infection will require a robust immune response and our search for a good adjuvant has led us to immuneregens material
5266753 we welcome this interaction with their scientists and hope to be able to determine if viprovex is well matched with our antigen in the next six months
5266754 the ability of viprovexs active ingredient sar9 met o2 11 substance p to generate not only antibody mediated responses but also support cellular responses via activation of specific immune cells gives us strong reason to expect adjuvant activity when coupled with vaccines such as those being developed by the biodesign institute
5266755 with our compound able to stimulate the immune system via both antibody and cellular immune responses to co administered protein and dna immunogens we optimistically anticipate a productive collaboration with dr arntzens team
5266756 we believe nicks exceptional track record of experience and accomplishments in channel development and sales will bring fresh perspective new ideas and effective strategies to efforts to grow our business presence in canada and maintain our leadership position in north america

5266758 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5266759 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5266760 at what time we feel an top guest among the way
5266761 if myselfs accordingly no dumbbell how come out i forgotten concentration
5266762 robert hat es jetzt selbst in der hand durch leistung zu berzeugen
5266763 i tended to put a little too much pressure on myself and i had some teammates tell me after the game that i have way better stuff than what i was showing out there
5266764 i tried to overthrow i tried to do too much i tried to be too detailed with what i was going out with i just let it get the best of me
5266765 thats why i was trying to do too much instead of trusting my stuff and letting it do its own work
5266766 his stuff was there fastball breaking ball it was sharp it just wasnt in the strike zone often and when it was it wasnt in the right location
5266767 after a start like that you just have to shake it off have a good side session and get right back out there for his next start in seattle
5266768 wir brauchen ein paar erfahrene spieler wenn wir die kriegen k nnen wir eine gute rolle spielen
5266769 optimalerweise w rden wir in der abwehr und im mittelfeld noch etwas machen wir gucken was wirtschaftlich machbar ist
5266770 wir haben schon im hinspiel gezeigt dass wir die bessere mannschaft sind und wollen die partie ohne wenn und aber gewinnen
5266771 wir haben schon beim 3 0 im hinspiel gegen moldawien dominiert und wollen uns auch am dienstag durchsetzen unser ziel ist es uns ber die playoffs f r die em zu qualifizieren
5266772 das macht freude der 1 spieltag war ein zeichen dass die liga im aufbruch ist da kommt bewegung rein
5266773 es w re schon erfreulich wenn es nach vielen jahren mal wieder einen gro en internationalen erfolg f r einen bundesliga verein geben w rde
5266774 besonders gut gefallen hat mir dass es kein verhaltener saisonstart war die vielen tore zeigen dass die teams die offensive suchen
5266775 aber ich glaube dass auch einige andere um den titel mitk mpfen werden schalke bremen stuttgart und m glicherweise auch leverkusen werden alles tun um den bayern das leben schwer zu machen
5266776 sie sind den richtigen weg gegangen und haben sehr klug in junge und qualitativ gute spieler investiert
5266777 von den bildern her sieht die strecke toll aus ich liebe stra enkurse
5266778 i dont know if its a glitch in the schedule or what to have to start the season in japan and then come out and do 23 games in 24 days on the road honestly its a joke
5266779 if we were in a pennant race right now this would be a joke
5266780 hopefully they can figure it out and they wont do it to any other teams after this
5266781 i work hard but i have no control over how these knees feel hopefully they give me a shot to play the rest of the year
5266782 i think that if i come back and play well and im healthy over the next six weeks i would love to come back here and be a part of this team next year
5266783 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5266784 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5266785 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5266786 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5266787 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5266788 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5266789 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5266790 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5266791 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5266792 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5266793 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5266794 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5266795 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5266796 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5266797 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5266798 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5266799 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5266800 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5266801 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5266802 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5266803 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5266804 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5266805 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5266806 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5266807 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5266808 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5266809 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5266810 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5266811 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5266812 this is a planning took where all things are going
5266813 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5266814 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5266815 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5266816 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5266817 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5266818 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5266819 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5266820 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5266821 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5266822 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5266823 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5266824 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5266825 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5266826 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5266827 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5266828 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5266829 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5266830 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5266831 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5266832 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5266833 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5266834 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5266835 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5266836 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5266837 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5266838 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5266839 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5266840 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5266841 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5266842 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5266843 this is exactly what you need to do to have everything you want to be financially and personally successful and famous and generally well liked
5266844 a relationship would be nice but i dont absolutely need one

5266856 religious texts published without authorization including bibles and qurans may be confiscated
5266857 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
5266858 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
5266859 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
5266860 keeps to the concept of putting peoples interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
5266861 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law
5266862 were being inconvenienced a little but its nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in china experience for their faith in jesus christ

5266871 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
5266872 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5266873 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5266874 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5266875 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5266880 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5266881 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5266882 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5266883 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5266884 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5266885 i strive to be as good a project leader as austin is
5266886 of course the this project would never have come to such a successful conclusion if the team would not have executed the project plan so well maybe we can celebrate this major accomplishment with some kind of party to show them how much the company appreciates their dedication

5266892 i think now shes swimming faster than she ever did before the accident
5266893 its hard to say if she hadnt been in accident would she be where she was today if lance armstrong had not experienced cancer would he have the same dedication and drive to be where he is today sometimes it takes a tragic moment in ones life to really set the ball in motion

5266898 someone has to take my leg from me at the beginning of the race and give it to me at the end
5266899 at the end of the day i am also disabled
5266900 one of the reasons why i do able bodied is because the disabled events dont have any long distance races
5266901 i am suppose to be in a strong 3g coverage area at home but i only have 1 bar
5266902 traveling around town sacramento area my 3g coverage changes dramatically from 1 bar to full bars not sure if its working properly or not
5266903 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5266904 lots of things make them work or not work even peoples sweaty hands could have an effect or how close they hold the device to their heads or what direction they are pointing the phone
5266905 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade of the chip so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever

5266950 melvin got a cortisone shot right before the all star break and the three days rest allowed the shot to work we talked about it a lot when he came back after the break he seemed to think that they hit the right spot that coupled with the rest that he had the three days he just took off i ve seen melvin hit the ball really really good before i ve seen him have a season in which he hit 27 28 homers i ve seen him have a season in which he 340 for us but this bit of a streak right here this is as hot as i ve seen him it s been six weeks now
5266951 man it s been awesome even his outs are hard he s become one of the best third basemen in the league in a matter of two months everything he s hit has just been whacked it s like whatever he wants to do he s doing it right now i ve never seen anybody this hot before in my life
5266952 our momentum has been incredible and in only nine months we have been able to sign on a number of brand marketers as well as advertising agencies who are now using our technology
5266953 while the online industry is still largely reliant on manual production of hundreds and sometimes even thousands of creative units for their campaigns our customers are seeing significant gains in time saved campaign flexibility cost savings and overall effectiveness that can be realized by powering their creative with adroit
5266954 the comparison of canadian and american drug prices again shows that canadas central planning approach to drug policy is failing to provide better outcomes on generic drug prices than the less interventionist more consumer friendly policies commonly used in the united states
5266955 canadians should put the blame squarely where it belongs bad government policies high canadian generic prices are caused by government policies that shield retail pharmacies and generic manufacturers from competitive market forces that would put downward pressure on generic drug prices
5266956 generic drug prices in the u s are much cheaper because governments south of the border tend to rely on competitive free market forces to discount the prices of generic drugs
5266957 employers have told us that the delays in processing these criminal record checks are causing serious staffing problems for them most noticeably in the adult social care sector
5266958 however i must also ensure that people who work with some of the more vulnerable people in society do not pose any risk to those they are supposed to be helping while the legislation will help employers hire staff before full criminal record checks have been completed there will still be robust safeguards and monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that all applicants are suitable for the positions to which they are appointed

5266985 this is all about bailing out the subprime lending industry
5266986 they will have checks written to them by the state of california if this goes through
5266987 subprime mortgage issues remain a key factor in influencing mortgage fraud directly and indirectly the subprime share of outstanding loans at higher risk of failure additionally during 2007 there were more than 2 2 million foreclosure filings reported on approximately 1 29 million properties nationally up 75 percent from 2006 the declining housing market affects many in the mortgage industry who are paid by commission during declining markets mortgage fraud perpetrators may take advantage of industry personnel attempting to generate loans to maintain current standards of living
5266988 that we are having a major speculative splurge as this is written is obvious to anyone not captured by vacuous optimism there is now far more stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it there are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute historically aware men and women to manage them i am not given to prediction ones foresight is forgotten only ones errors are well remembered but there is here a basic recurrent process it comes with rising prices whether of stocks real estate works of art or anything else this increase attracts attention and buyers which produces the further effect of even higher prices expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up the process continues optimism with its market effect is the order of the day prices go up even more then for reasons that will endlessly be debated come the end the descent is always more sudden than the increase a to repeat i make no prediction i only observe that this phenomenon has manifested itself many times since 1637 when dutch speculators saw tulip bulbs as their magic road to wealth and 1720 when john law brought presumptive wealth and then sudden poverty to paris through the pursuit of gold to this day undiscovered in louisiana in these years aslso the great south sea bubble spread financial devastation in britain
5266989 through 1925 the pursuit of effortless riches brought people to florida in satisfactorily increasing numbers
5266990 not more than three fourths of a mile from the prosperous and fast growing city of nettie
5266991 this reluctance to concede that the end has come is also in accordance with the classic pattern the end had come in florida in 1925 bank clearings in miami were 1 066 528 000 by 1928 they were down to 143 364 000 farmers who had sold their land at a handsome price and had condemned themselves as it later sold for double treble quadruple the original price now on occasion got it back through a whole chain of subsequent defaults sometimes it was equipped with eloquently named streets and with sidewalks street lamps and taxes and assessments amounting to several times its current value
5266992 he was a director to general motors an ally of the du ponts and soon to be chairman of the democratic national committee by choice of al smith
5266993 the shrewd worldly wise candidate of one of the great political parties chooses one of the outstanding operators in the stock market as a goodwill creator and popular vote getter
5266994 if smith should be elected with a democratic congress we are almost certain to have a resulting business depression in 1929
5266995 the election of hoover and a republican congress should result in continued prosperity for 1929
5266996 there is no cause for worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
5266997 some of those in positions of authority wanted the boom to continue they were making money out of it and they had an intimation of the personal disaster which awaited them when the boom came to an end but there were also some who saw however dimly that a wild speculation was in progress and that something should be done for these people however every proposal to act raised the same intractable problem the consequences of successful action seemed almost as terrible as the consequences of inaction and they could be more horrible for those who took action a bubble can easily be punctured but to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy among those who sensed what was happening in 1929 there was some hope but no confidence that the boom could be made to subside
5266998 the mystery of the half filled stands at many events at the 2008 olympic games has been solved according to chinese internet users who say it is the result of a policy to prevent the gathering of large and possibly uncontrollable crowds
5266999 people are so angry because they slept all night outside ticket booths and got nothing and now they see this
5267000 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5267001 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5267002 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5267003 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5267004 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5267005 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5267006 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5267007 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5267008 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5267009 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5267010 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5267011 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5267012 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5267013 create opportunities for women who blog to pursue exposure education community and economic empowerment its the number one community for and guide to blogs by women
5267014 lose win is no worse than win lose because it has no standards no demands no expectations no vision people who think lose win are usually quick to please or appease they seek strength from popularity or acceptance they have little courage to express their own feelings and convictions and are easily intimidated by the ego strength of others
5267015 quella volta che non ti preoccuperai sar la volta buona ke ti succede qualcosa
5267016 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5267017 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5267018 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5267019 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5267020 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5267021 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

5267029 our workforce needs qualified well trained employees if we are to achieve our vision of an innovative dynamic economy it is only by increasing the skill set of our workforce that we can hope to attract the inward investment we need to grow our economy
5267030 step up is playing a key role in helping us achieve that goal providing 500 qualified skilled potential employees that would otherwise not have existed and that inward investors are very attracted to
5267031 since its inception in 2000 step up has been hugely successful in achieving its objectives of raising the aspirations motivation and performance of students who might otherwise have never gone to university
5267032 step up is as an outstanding example of best practice in the provision of educational opportunities for students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds
5267033 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5267034 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5267035 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5267036 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5267037 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5267038 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5267039 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5267040 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5267041 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5267042 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5267043 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5267044 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5267045 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5267046 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5267047 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5267048 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5267049 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5267050 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5267051 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5267052 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5267053 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5267054 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5267055 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5267056 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5267057 in the north of ireland we have an education system that produces many great achievements and i celebrate those
5267058 our education system is outdated and in need of reform to ensure that all children from every background are given the opportunity to fulfil their potential
5267059 it will involve building a system which can sustain a range of different types of schools and provision which values them all equally
5267060 the scottish law commission carries out its programme of law reform in a thorough and systematic way and its work is greatly valued by the scottish government we are delighted that patrick layden has agreed to accept appointment as commissioner his skills and expertise will be a great asset

5267065 one crucial difference between the current east west confrontation and the cold war is that this time the economic ties binding the two sides are stronger
5267066 such aggression must not be rewarded but cold war style brinkmanship will not make russias neighbours safer it will only reinforce the kremlins view that small states are pawns in a strategic game the best guarantee of security and peace in europe since the end of the cold war has been economic integration achieved through the eu it is brussels not washington that stands the best chance of persuading moscow to change its ways
5267067 europe is the only player that can be seen as an honest broker europes initial ambivalence might prove the unlikely key to its success post soviet member states are more inclined to lay blame for the conflict at russias door others including italy have expressed an opposing view by acknowledging that there are different opinions over responsibility for this conflict the eu can better adopt a position of neutrality in its negotiations

5267205 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide
5267206 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5267207 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us

5267270 rfid offers adopters of the technology a number of benefits from improvements in manufacturing inventory and distribution processes to reduced costs for product theft spoilage or obsolescence
5267271 its incumbent on our industry with help from organizations such as comptia to help customers overcome any obstacles to rfid usage and help them benefit from the efficiencies rfid can deliver
5267272 in the market rfid has come to refer to inventory tracking where nfc is more specific to person transactions a key difference between rfid and nfc protocols are the way in which the master slave relationship is handled
5267273 not only does nfc have a much shorter transmission range than rfid inherently making it more secure than traditional rfid but applications running over nfc technologies will more than likely encrypt the data that is being transmitted so even if there is a sniffer trying to pick up the transmission it wont pick up anything of use because of the encryption
5267274 security is something you dont just have with a purchased product you have to keep working on it every day this area needs a certain level of education on what it is and how it works in the wireless world the big challenge is how the rfid device integrates with security measures
5267275 there is no difference whether the use is short or long distance what matters more are other factors that affect security
5267276 there are multiple points with the hardware and software that allow the possibility of a breach
5267277 some vendors say im compliant today so i am ok but that is not true
5267278 rfid users need monitoring of the network this didnt exist before hardware and software vendors all have their own offerings the challenge is how to make it all work together this is the crux of what is happening
5267279 i am sad to have to announce that i will be resigning from my post as the county councillor for mount joy as recent changes in family circumstances and significantly increased personal commitments will involve me in spending more time on the mainland i believe that constituents deserve full attention which until now ive been able to provide them im sending out a final newsletter to my residents this week to update them on ward issues and to provide some contact details to use until my successor has been elected i will continue to represent mount joy on the newly formed newport parish council

5267286 only time will tell to what extent the chinese economy has decoupled from the rest of the world
5267287 the outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in the western economies bhp doesnt appear to be too worried because of the ongoing demand coming from chinas industrialization
5267288 its good it shows theyre still positive about their business
5267289 weve always said that weve got a diversified portfolio some products perform a little weaker others perform a little stronger
5267290 strong global demand for resources continues to provide cost challenges for the whole industry this is mainly due to rising prices for inputs such as diesel steel making coke and explosives and shortages of skilled labour
5267291 bhps quoted cost growth of 4 3 per cent is highly creditable in comparison with its peers
5267292 both absolute and multiple based valuation measures of bhp look cheaper than we have witnessed since 2001 2 and it remains our preferred stock in the sector

5267294 i can say he tried to hit me but i ran through it
5267295 thats something i was amazed about a great tackler like c j and i broke his tackle not many backs get a chance to do that
5267296 throughout practice they have been crushing us most of the time we have barely been able to get the ball off so we looked to liven it up a bit this weekend
5267297 we didnt hardly show anything of who we are going to be today on either side of the ball we executed on both sides of the ball i was pleased
5267298 hes a great route runner and caught some good balls today
5267299 it was good we were first down and driving the ball and go down the field some hit some short passes and run the ball well the offensive line did a good job today and theyve come a long way
5267300 the positives from the coaches have been good and weve had no one hurt knock on wood
5267301 mark and i are real good friends and we hang out a lot when you are out there you are just trying to do your best we you are competing its all about on the field
5267302 definitely when a new coordinator comes in you have to learn the new offense so fast and you miss a lot of things hes been going over it and going over it with us and now i feel more comfortable in the system
5267303 all the routes are the same but everyone of them has a different name so sometimes you find yourself going back to the old stuff some but once you are doing it every day and twice a day monday wednesday and friday of last week and next week the old stuff kind of leaves your head i would not call being the older quarterback a disadvantage but it was something i had to overcome
5267304 the speed of the game is very different especially when i got to the second level defensive secondary
5267305 i really got to get very focused and with the fans i got a good tempo of game speed
5267306 thats one thing my coach will worry about you can have 100 good things and one bad thing and he will focus on that so ive got to get better at that
5267307 its a lot more reps and your conditioning is not up to par so you have to work hard and practice twice as hard to the games will be easy to you got to work harder in practice

5267452 we do not gather ourselves god gathers us god invites us in
5267453 as divine host god through christ in the spirit draws us into communion with himself and others giving us desires we had not previously even imagined
5267454 is not a zero sum game but one of overflowing plentitude
5267455 because we have been so deeply formed by living in a market society consumerism competition and individualism already shape our lives
5267456 that through our choices we are our own creators which is exactly what a market society with its relentless advertising campaign would want us to believe
5267457 does not aim for self fulfillment through autonomous choice but for allowing god to re create us
5267458 we have discovered that we have a common spirituality of humility and presence close to the poor and the weak a common call to live with them not to change them but to welcome them and share their gifts and their beauty to discover in them the presence of jesus jesus humble and gentle jesus poor and rejected
5267459 such hospitality is not an individual or even a communal achievement
5267460 it is rather a gift to be received and its faithful reception makes us part of something larger than ourselves christs own body

5267488 the gain of hosting major international games can not be quantified the benefits are in chains they include infrastructural development trade and business opportunities
5267489 hosting the olympics has opened the eyes of first time visitors to china and it is a strong indication that the country has moved from third world country status to a developed nation
5267490 the cities can be compared to any great city in the world and from the comments of everybody here the games are one of the best olympics
5267491 with the hosting of the games the chinese government has provided additional infrastructure for the people new roads games village hospitals and hotels were constructed
5267492 but after the games and the departure of the visitors it is the citizens who will benefit from the infrastructure provided certainly the visitors will not go with those facilities
5267493 we had a similar experience in abuja towards hosting of the 8th all africa games roads were constructed a games village was built and one the best stadia in africa was built

5267509 the 2 5 percent tax must go to the department of health doh but it is still with the national treasury we will have to find out what is happening to the money
5267510 the problem is their fear that with picture based warning there will be a drastic reduction in excise taxes and that will affect the percentage of revenues that is supposed to go back to their provinces under republic act 7171

5267611 i got tripped in transition and cut my toe but no excuses i just didnt perform on the day its very disappointing im sorry to new zealand sorry to my sponsors in whangarei
5267612 i decided to go out hard and tried to hang on as long as i could and then hang on to someone who was my own pace but eighth was my best today
5267613 that last one kilometre i felt like i had asthma even though i dont have asthma
5267614 i was just trying to hit the run as well as i could hang in there but those girls that were there have been running really good
5267615 i was stoked and first new zealander as well i set top 10 as my goal so my coach will be happy and im really happy
5267616 the girls put everything out right from the gun coming off the bike they really attacked it right from the start
5267617 it took me a while to get into my pace and unfortunately it was a bit too long but i found my legs near the end and managed get into the top 10
5267618 that was a very challenging bike and i was very thankful to see the finish line
5267619 hell be claiming that australian background at the moment i think
5267620 i think a good poker face is probably the best way to put it i definitely felt every kilometre and every minute of that race

5267670 weve had talent weve had strong players but for whatever reason we werent able to take that next step i think now its just sort of happening its not like were just a bunch of chumps swimming around out there
5267671 when i came onboard it was as close to a dysfunctional family as you could find wed been through three coaches in three years there were a lot of individuals a lot of good pieces they just didnt really believe in themselves and they werent really a team

5267690 saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5267691 its the sort of stuff that gets said every day in the schoolyard a lot of young people are quite impressionable and when they see celebrities saying stuff like that they think its ok to say it themselves
5267692 when i talked to president bush he told me all of americas proud of me and then he told me to give my mom a hug and tell her the president sent it

5267702 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone

5267713 los administrativos se limitan a transmitir la informaci n que se les suministra desde el rea jur dica ante determinados casos que se plantean
5267714 pero son los empleados del ministerio de trabajo quienes transmiten la informaci n del especialista porque si no vamos a entrar en la locura de pensar que todo el personal del organismo tiene que ser abogado
5267715 si van diez trabajadores distintos a preguntar por la misma cosa seguramente que la primera vez se consulta pero no las nueve siguientes
5267716 tanto en las dependencias laborales de ushuaia como de r o grande tienen una gran cantidad de a os prestando servicios y saben el procedimiento a seguir en muchas situaciones por supuesto que consultan a los abogados del rea antes de asesorar a alg n trabajador cuando se trata de casos distintos a los que hasta el momento ven an manejando
5267717 es voluntad de esta gesti n que el cuerpo de asesores jur dicos del ministerio crezca porque de todos los abogados que existen en el mbito de la administraci n p blica quienes m s tienen contacto directo con los trabajadores son los de esta rea

5267736 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5267737 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5267738 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5267739 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5267740 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5267741 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5267743 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5267744 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5267745 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5267746 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5267766 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

5267768 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5267769 im really sorry to burden you with all this i mean its not your job to listen to my problems and i guess it is my job to go and fetch web pages for you but i couldnt get this one im so sorry
5267770 ik word geconfronteerd met een eisenlijstje van cda en vvd
5267771 i am pleased that we are able to make a net profit in the most difficult business environment in the airline industrys history but the industry outlook is still very grim
5267772 its a very difficult business environment to achieve these full year profit targets but we will give it our very best shot
5267773 anything above 100 a barrel is bad oil prices have marginally reduced but it must come down a lot more for the problem to go away
5267774 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5267775 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out
5267776 three years ago you could see 10 to 20 oxcarts a day driving trees away but now we only see a couple oxcarts per week
5267777 we had to make the villagers understand that they could survive without damaging the land
5267778 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5267779 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5267780 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5267781 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5267782 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5267783 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5267784 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5267785 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5267786 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5267787 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5267788 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5267789 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5267790 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5267791 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5267792 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5267793 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5267794 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5267795 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5267796 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5267797 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5267798 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5267799 who are open to doing something on the production side
5267800 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5267801 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5267802 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5267803 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5267804 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5267805 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5267806 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5267807 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5267808 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5267809 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5267810 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5267811 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5267812 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5267813 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5267814 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5267815 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5267816 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5267817 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5267818 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5267819 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5267820 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5267821 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5267822 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5267823 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5267824 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5267825 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5267826 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5267827 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5267828 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5267829 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5267830 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5267831 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5267832 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5267833 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5267834 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5267835 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5267836 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5267837 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5267838 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5267839 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5267840 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5267841 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5267842 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5267843 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5267844 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha

5267882 why do you refuse to meet with faithful catholics with whom you dont agree and prohibit them from meeting on church property why do you deny members of voice of the faithful the right to gather in their parishes to discuss the scandal of priestly sexual abuse and the attendant cover up by the bishops why do you deny them the right to gather in their parishes to discuss financial embezzlement by pastors and negligence in episcopal oversight why do you refuse to permit distinguished leaders of the american catholic community such as bishop thomas gumbleton and richard mcbrien to speak on church property if the events are hosted by voice of the faithful why do you not extend a warm welcome to survivors of priestly sexual abuse and encourage them to meet in parish churches to tell their stories if they wish to do so
5267883 given the traditional role of the ordained priest as the presider at the eucharist what will happen to the eucharistic liturgy in our parishes if there is no priest
5267884 no one who is unwanted should be made a bishop the desire and consent of the clergy and people is required
5267885 the one who is to be head over all should be elected by all
5267886 it is essential to exclude all those unwanted and unasked for
5267887 would not restoration of the ancient practice of election by clergy and people in a provincial synod presided over by the archbishop give new life to local churches would that not establish a firm bond of loyalty between the bishop and his people
5267888 as the church cries out today for new structures that will hold bishops accountable to the priests and people they lead why should not the canons of nicaea and trent be implemented

5267893 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil
5267894 there was a strong performance from all divisions and a positive investment result which is an achievement given the buffeting many investments even the short dated and highly rate ones we favour have had in the recent market turmoil

5267902 application of the solar panels to the tie made it difficult to tie the knot in typical tie knots a small loop is created through which the large end of the tie is passed
5267903 at this step in the process the physical width of the solar panel forces the user to enlarge their tie loop to allow the solar panel to pass through
5267904 the solar panels are limited to bending around a three inch diameter and should not be creased usage of narrower solar panels was considered but there would be sacrifices in power generation applying solar panels to clip on ties would eliminate this problem
5267905 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5267906 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5267907 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5267908 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5267909 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment
5267910 reality only reveals itself when it is illuminated by a ray of poetry
5267911 in science one tries to tell people in such a way as to be understood by everyone something that no one ever knew before but in poetry its the exact opposite
5267912 the adventitious beauty of poetry may be felt in the greater delight with a verse given in a happy quotation than in the poem
5267913 there is not a particle of life which does not bear poetry within it
5267914 poetry is the language in which man explores his own amazement
5267915 theres no money in poetry but theres no poetry in money either
5267916 when power narrows the areas of mans concern poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence when power corrupts poetry cleanses
5267917 perhaps no person can be a poet or can even enjoy poetry without a certain unsoundness of mind

5267924 she really stuck it to us and seeing her out there you never wanted to give up
5267925 you never stop hoping and trying but she is one of the best triathletes out there so i wasnt going to hold my breath
5267926 i wanted to settle into the run in the first two laps and build the second two and hope the other girls might have gone out a little too hard i guess i got lucky my plan went well today and i came away with the bronze

5267928 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

5267966 when he went to the stadium he went in with the greatest and strongest will he wanted to compete
5267967 liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain in unbearable
5267968 im used to that being in lane 9 i was there in 2004 my goal was to run the first 200 and then see where im at hopefully get a good lane in the semi final we have a chance to get top three it will take a lot of work but anything is possible im very impressed with the fans here we had a 9 00am start and the stadium is almost full
5267969 you know i thought id be able to run a little slower i did what i had to do to make it through trainings been going well ive had some pretty good training sessions usa is always considered the number one track team for me im just going out there and doing the best i can do im representing the u s to the best of my ability
5267970 its time to go time to showdown and throw down
5267971 it was a good run im just surviving and advancing like at the trials im pretty relaxed i trust in my training and everything ive put in to get here
5267972 it was just one of those days i knew what i had to do and i was prepared but unfortunately i just didnt do it today
5267973 my training went well i felt good technically i knew going in that my number one thing was to be technically sound i didnt want to get over excited i knew thered be 90 000 people out there watching i talked myself down and unfortunately it didnt work out
5267974 i made it through the competition it was actually a good day for me even though it doesnt look like it on paper my second throw would have qualified me for the final but it was out of the sector i know i competed well
5267975 its been a rough year i dont know what happened i couldnt pull it out today
5267976 im not disappointed they jumped really good today and i didnt i cant say anything negative about today i trained and prepared and executed it just didnt work out id rather have been here there are 18 20 people at home whod love to have my credential
5267977 im pleased with fourth i started cramping on the third lap and lost touch with third place so thats a little disappointing but i feel i tried to pull out what i could today and im really happy with fourth
5267978 there was a big group on the bike i tried to attack on the bike but the pack kept us in it
5267979 so it came down to a strong run i felt good on the run but 11th place you know i cant complain
5267980 i just got a lower back cramp on the first hill and it was hard for me to recover it lasted the first three laps of the run the last lap i felt great i wish it was a 20k
5267981 i was still happy with my performance but the bike was definitely the hardest part today i knew going in that this wasnt a course that played to my strengths i feel it did well my goal was to stay with that lead pack on the bike i cant say it was easy but i managed to do that and then the run i was kind of out of gas
5267982 i felt great after the swim getting on the bike and staying with the girls we all worked the hill quite well i felt strong and was ready to get out on the run where i knew it was going to come down to
5267983 i knew it was going to be fast and was going to take some deep digging to keep with the girls i did my best to dig and stay with them a little bit of cramping set me back but thats part of racing
5267984 we had a great time at the opening ceremonies were taking in the whole experience and taking in what the olympics is all about
5267985 emma is definitely the mark and thats what well build toward over the next four years

5267992 jennifer was het beu alles te betalen als john zijn portefeuille opentrekt komen er spinnewebben uit john had het leven van een filmster met jennifer ze zei daar nooit iets over maar het was duidelijk dat het haar irriteerde

5267994 ik hou wel van die baan 9 ik liep er in osaka ook al mijn persoonlijk record de start was wel vervelend omdat het stadion heel rumoerig was door andere nummers ik hield het hoofd koel startte goed maakte een klein foutje in de bocht maar in de laatste rechte lijn heb ik toch mijn derde plaats kunnen veiligstellen
5267995 ik heb hiermee mijn halve finale van het wk bevestigd ik zit rond de toptien in de wereld en dat is toch heel fraai morgen kan ik nu ontspannen lopen en op mijn persoonlijk record mikken mijn spelen zijn dus al geslaagd en er is nog goed nieuws op komst over een maand bevalt mijn vriendin

5267998 we wachten dus af tot morgenvroeg de beslissing hangt vooral van de fysieke aspecten af hoe het mentaal zit met haar na haar uitschakeling op de 100 meter het is nog te vroeg voor haar om alles te kunnen plaatsen het is voor haar vooral nog een groot vraagteken wat er precies gebeurd is
5267999 sowieso had de starter het als een valse start moeten beoordelen of ze zelf haar arm had moeten opsteken zijn vijgen na pasen in elke normale omstandigheid wordt ze teruggefloten zoiets als gisteren is totaal nieuw op zich heeft haar uitschakeling geen invloed op het aflossingsnummer kim zet zich in elke situatie altijd voor de volle 100 procent in en zal dat ook nu doen

5268004 there are definitely two sides to every story and you always have to take that into account
5268005 i could see the bursts of gunfire and idf soldiers on the israeli side started calling out to me telling me when to run and when to stop
5268006 they began taking off my clothes seeing where i had been hit if it werent for them i would have bled to death in the desert they saved my life
5268007 i knew that the only way i would be safe was to come to israel
5268008 but after hiking for hours in the desert through the mountains it became hard to avoid the egyptian army
5268009 i came to his aid because he needed someone and also because we are fellow countrymen
5268010 africans come to israel because they are told they will be treated fairly here
5268011 if you asked many of them to show you israel on the map they wouldnt be able to do it but they still know this is the only place they can come that will help them

5268034 when the layoffs were announced the staff immediately went into convulsions
5268035 she was devastated and the rest of us felt completely vulnerable like no one was safe
5268036 its like the gestapo comes in the night one day someones working beside you and the next theyre just gone and youre like wheres mike youre just exhausted from worrying about your job security all the time
5268037 people often go into survivor mode they can be consumed by fear stress or anger
5268038 the no complaining rule positive ways to deal with negativity at work
5268039 often theyre no longer thinking about performance or career goals just how can i survive
5268040 when this kind of thing happens people look up and say what are they doing up there
5268041 can create a downward spiral for the survivors who begin to feel that no matter how hard they work that no matter how productive or creative they are it might very well be them in the next layoff cycle
5268042 people cant get anything done because you never know when youre going to get called into your boss office and get mowed down
5268043 its like why bother you might think people would bear down and work hard but they know thats not how decisions are made its not like george costanza where you can just shuffle your papers and pretend youre busy and youre going to be spared theres a lot of tension
5268044 but they just let another 50 people go last week they said that was it but thats what they said the first time so everyone below director level is preparing for the worst
5268045 a lot of work isnt getting done people are interviewing at other places because they dont want to wait to be fired
5268046 there have been two major rounds of layoffs so far and both times the news was on the blogs before the bosses told us anything
5268047 it was embarrassing that the public knew before we did but it felt like the higher ups didnt care
5268048 they told me i was fired and within like 10 minutes they pulled the plug on me my blackberry was disconnected my e mail stopped working and my computer was shut down
5268049 youre basically fused to your computer and your phone 24 7 in my line of work so it was a real shock i felt like a limb was cut off
5268050 there was some crying after the last round you just dont see that at a law firm of this caliber
5268051 there was no work for them to do some people were desperate taking on any project even if it was beneath them
5268052 do anything and everything to please managers because theyre petrified of being fired
5268053 theyre still there but theyre totally disengaged from the company
5268054 we went out for drinks but it was so awkward i felt like somehow it was my fault they were fired i felt so guilty i paid for everyones drinks but i think that just made them resent me
5268055 i used get terrible stress headaches every day now at least i dont wake up worrying if this is the day im going to get fired
5268056 the managers knew they had a workforce culture to maintain
5268057 if they had just gone through with a machete how do you think the remaining workers wouldve reacted
5268058 help employees who remain work their way through the psychological and emotional transitions that follow these types of external changes
5268059 one friday morning they told everyone to shut down our computers and sit quietly at our desks like we were children then hr came around one floor at a time if your phone rang you were called into the supervisors office and sent packing
5268060 i saw people actually jump when their phones rang a few girls started crying
5268061 it was such a betrayal people dont feel loyal to the organization anymore
5268062 but if you live in baghdad you start getting used to bombs dropping all around you
5268063 it gets ugly fast and its easy to be spotted doing it
5268064 try to conduct yourself like its business as usual at least in public
5268065 talking about your anxiety at the situation with people you trust is essential
5268066 list the doomsday scenarios can i pay rent next month
5268067 dont wait for your company to announce layoffs to consider your options
5268068 in this economy you should always be networking and keeping your resume fresh
5268069 dont just say those guys were jerks and im glad to be gone let yourself experience the shock denial and depression

5268090 this is an issue that is not on the table
5268091 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5268092 your refusal to sign vouchers interrupting and disrupting meetings disrespect for other commissioners and the fire chief are detrimental to the functioning of the board and fall within the quoted rcws and the definition of misfeasance
5268093 its kind of like say youre playing baseball but he wont go to bat
5268094 hes not doing the duties he was elected to do
5268095 i dont think this was done right and i question the other district 18 commissioners ethics and legality
5268096 basically the charges that were made against him were all found to be valid
5268097 misfeasance is just that youre not sort of doing what youre supposed to be doing as an elected official in that position
5268098 at this point it is kind of late in the season
5268099 i feel that enough public awareness is out there regarding his conduct that should he run for election again hopefully the people will make a very well educated decision maybe a better decision than the last time

5268122 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5268123 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5268124 thats where we put her when we have to go somewhere
5268125 she was starting to potty in the house every time we left

5268127 were worried about winter obviously the porch is not heated we want to be able to let her stay in the house
5268128 i was coming out of a house last winter it was really cold and it was about 10 p m and i felt so happy because the lesson went really well and the dog seemed calmer
5268129 if theyre put in a leadership position when theyre not ready they can be fearful

5268139 taking a family picture in our family is definitely a chaotic event

5268143 the first day that the babies popped their heads out and you couldnt get round the enclosure for members of the public looking to catch a glimpse
5268144 the kids think theyre fantastic and we frequently get asked if we can pick them up and hand them to children but they have quite a severe bite

5268149 because this information is now in the public domain the agc acknowledges that the fundamental baptist service led by chaplain stuart kazarovich an agc endorsed chaplain appears to have been suppressed because it was offensive to the brigade chaplain
5268150 in short this calls attention to the suppression of a fundamental baptist service and the commands insensitivity to religious hostility
5268151 the deepest dive made by the mir 1 and mir 2 has so far been 1 608 meters
5268152 this month has been the wettest august on record with 177 8mm of rainfall the last wettest august was in a 1956 with 161mm of rainfall
5268153 there is a moderate risk of further disruption across northern ireland during monday as a result of further outbreaks of fairly heavy rain especially during the afternoon and evening
5268154 there was clearly ample opportunity to design the underpass for any eventuality particularly when you consider the amount of money invested so it comes as a great disappointment that a project like this fails on its first test
5268155 obviously there has to be a detailed inquiry why the road wasnt tested for how it would cope with inclement weather conditions and it shows that the drd is going to have to reconsider developments in future in light of the flash flooding we have been experiencing
5268156 the teams of workers from the emergency services northern ireland water the roads service and the rivers agency need to be congratulated for their tireless efforts in helping people and tackling the floods
5268157 however the roads service has serious questions to answer about how the new westlink underpass could be flooded so quickly this will mean traffic chaos as the main route into belfast is impassable roads service will have to explain how this could happen and what steps they are going to take to ensure that it does not happen again the sdlp will be seeking an urgent meeting with roads service
5268158 motorists can expect disruptions to traffic this morning as the westlink underpass is completely closed and traffic is tailed back to the m1
5268159 i have asked roads service to carry out a full investigation into the underpass flooding
5268160 the contractors are still working here and we will want to be talking to them to ascertain how it became flooded and why it didnt clear itself quickly as well as to make sure that this sort of thing doesnt happen in future

5268166 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5268167 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5268168 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5268169 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5268170 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5268171 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5268172 when we recruited kevin the coaches thought he would be very capable of leading our team when it became his time
5268173 now is that time and we have no doubt he is ready for the challenge

5268179 to press a little bit higher instead of dropping as we have the last couple weeks in the end it worked out for us
5268180 you give yourself the opportunity to press a little higher make life more difficult in their half of the pitch the downside of playing with one center forward is sometimes that he gets a little isolated so thats why the two wide players have to show tremendous energy to join in on countless occasions they did and if it means replacing them to keep up the tempo and press the opponent to make a pass or delivery theyre not ready to make
5268181 its great to have mike petke and the addition of cory gibbs two extremely experienced defenders
5268182 the back four that we had have all played center back at some point in time the feeling was that we needed resilience out there and we got that the two center backs would probably admit that they had a little but of rust but theyre experienced players its a terrific combination they are defenders they want to attack the ball they want to make physical contact theyre not comfortable dropping off and being maybe more of a construction defender or positional player but thats exactly what were looking for but sometimes if you play where someone attacks the ball and somebody drops off it doesnt always work out that way when youre looking for results you need big characters and strong individuals and we got that tonight

5268220 the military has been central to this major shift in pakistan
5268221 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
5268222 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
5268223 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board

5268300 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5268301 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5268302 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5268303 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5268304 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5268305 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5268306 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5268307 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5268308 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5268446 make our equivalence equal to the percentages secured in our o a level result or increase our equivalence of a grade from 85 per cent to at least 90 per cent similarly equivalence of other grades should also be increased equivalence of previous years candidates should be revised as well so that it is fairly comparable to the fsc score and students who suffered last year can now get admission on merit abolish mcat right from this year or for a level students set a separate test based on their own syllabus and pattern set a separate and equal quota of seats for a levels and fsc students

5268458 it is obvious when one looks at the footage that yeager has captured you have to begin to not only suspect the fake paintings that are sold but also wonder about the responsibility of the press who only continued to promote the highwaymen shows with no real sense of accuracy of the authenticity of the art yeager delves into ft pierce looking for the highwaymen as he documents his earnest desire to paint with the highwaymen when he discovers livingston roberts at his home we see many of the artist gathered together including a rare scene with a staged but sincere reunion with jimmy stovall the artist talk on camera about the old days and yeager instead of choosing to edit the scenes lets the moments be so we can get a perspective of a times that have now passed livingston passed away several years ago and we see yeager and livingston painting together as yeager dreamed the day would happen there are precious moments where yeager tries to persuade rodney demps to paint again yeager discovers rodney wants a new truck so he purchases paints brushes massonite boards and recreates a scene that is reminiscent of alfred hair painting his art with a photo of a cadillac tacked up close by for his inspiration to make money yeager returns days later to discover the artist has disappeared and left the state yeager returns again and again to the neighborhood trying to make friends many are sceptical but it is livingston who senses billys true desire to become an artist and we as an audience watch as billy brings his guitars his first paintings and convinces livingston to let him paint yeager devoted a year to the project driving all the way from miami to ft pierce 5 days a week if one was to debate whether yeager is an expert or not and about the fakes and forgeries this footage will prove that yeager at least goes a bit further than just the surface and reveals there is so much more to the highwaymen than what is previously known

5268521 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5268522 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5268523 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5268524 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles

5268535 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5268536 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5268537 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5268538 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5268576 but now the righteousness of god has been manifested apart from the law although the law and the prophets bear witness to it the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe for there is no distinction for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith this was to show gods righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins it was to show his righteousness at the present time so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in jesus
5268577 the law was added so that the trespass might increase but where sin increased grace increased all the more so that just as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5268578 be a sinner and let your sins be strong but let your trust in christ be stronger and rejoice in christ who is the victor over sin death and the world
5268579 it is apparent you miss your own point though because you continue to talk about atheists as though you could pluck any single
5268580 unfortunately for you and fortunately for the rest of the world there are those of us who while we dont believe in any god or gods have not become lost in drugs and
5268581 just know that there are a lot of us out here who are not mad at god who didnt leave religion for the reasons which caused you to go and can still call ourselves atheists if we like that term just because you werent one of those dont assume none of us exist
5268582 i dont think the rest of the world is atheistic do you
5268583 we are angry because when youre dead and gone were still going to be dealing with and trying to undo the ignorance youve spread just by teaching your children what youve taught them
5268584 but your beliefs do jim i am one who is living proof of that
5268585 you believe what you want and ill believe what i want
5268586 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
5268587 yes you do a minute ago you were concerned that he teaches god to his children
5268588 wheres your evidence that the bible is the word of god rather than one of the countless other books which make this claim
5268589 grand overarching metanarrative sic that gives context clarity and meaning to their life lives
5268590 dont know god exists or you wouldnt have any reason for faith
5268591 havent you told me that one day all of my beliefs will not be enough that sin will overwhelm me and i wont be able to explain it away or deny it
5268592 i suspect what you are wanting to argue is since it is true that there is no god then parents who are teaching their children there is a god are deceiving them the sub premise to that point being that since the theistic parents cant possibly know whether or not god exists they cant be stating a fact about the world therefore parents who teach their children god exists are deceiving them and such a deceitful act is improper treatment of the child hence abuse does that restatement of your argument represent your contention well enough
5268593 all of this stuff couldnt have gotten here without someone putting it here so there must be a god
5268594 why did you not want to interpret it as i wrote it
5268595 it can be argued about but to say one believes in god to put it in such a generic way is not to say anything about god
5268596 but i do not mean teaching all errors is abuse necessarily
5268597 there are of course exceptions to almost all rules so i see the word
5268598 and it is this intentional ignorance im talking about when i say that teaching children evolution is not occuring is a form of abuse
5268599 michael they are usually being honest that there will be exceptions to the rule and in this case exceptions to the meaning of
5268600 and this is what god is like this is gods name these are gods expectations etc
5268601 your claim is highly subjective and appears to rest upon what you think is an error right
5268602 it does allow you to twist what im saying to make it seem like im saying even teaching a child that god exists is abuse
5268603 this is what god is like this is gods name these are gods expectations etc
5268604 just to be clear though we all agree unicorns are imaginary yes
5268605 im talking about teaching things which are known to be false
5268606 when no one had yet devised a way to determine the validity of the belief were not at fault
5268607 if you believe god to exist it follows that god did make the apple fall since we know about gravity though we can talk about that as the force god uses to accomplish the task of causing the apple to fall
5268608 im not implying at all that people who believe in god would have to stop believing in god to believe evolution since believers put god at the head of everything it follows that everything one ever discusses involves god in some way evolution need not be left out just because no one has explained it in light of scripture in fact many have already done so
5268609 i want to make a distinction one i believe but one that is not necessarily shared by many there is a difference between a parent teaching a child that he she meaning either parent believes in god and teaching that child that he she meaning the child should also believe in god one can teach this idea in a more subjective manner providing one is not so afraid and inflexible as to believe that god has commanded them to teach this one view i know this will be viewed as being relativistic and that i am tipping my hand to show i am a relativist when it comes to religion if there is a god i believe that god would view any and all religions as attempts to capture in human terms this idea which escapes definition i know we disagree on this point
5268610 im talking about the exceptions to that rule and the more people study in the field of psychology the more they find them
5268611 im not sure i really know what point you are trying to make there are some christians who believe god caused evolution they are called theistic evolutionists not all christians adhere to a young earth creation theory
5268612 evolution need not be left out just because no one has explained it in light of scripture in fact many have already done so emphasis added
5268613 which if you were reading me carefully instead of simply to find the weak links in my arguments you would have noticed i addressed in the very paragraph you quote
5268614 needless to say i think i am missing your point so perhaps you could restate it differently
5268615 through the consonance of judeo christian holy writ with moral and social realities
5268616 isnt that just as much a leap of faith as believing something to be credible because it answers the most questions with the least amount of problems
5268617 is information which is not verified empirically really valid i would like to know what youre talking about here i would like to know how you go about verifying things in any way other than empirically this is a serious question
5268618 id need to understand more what youre talking about when you say you have other ways of finding evidence than empiricism
5268619 all my neighbors know i can drive a car too
5268620 i feel like ive been on tour with a rock band
5268621 i feel like ive been on tour with a famous singer im ready to get home get back to my bed and kind of get into a routine of the season this hasnt been easy playing traveling unnecessary traveling but this is how it goes

5268623 my suggestion to the transplanted favre perhaps the most talented quarterback of his era is to embrace boldness

5268625 please tell us more about how you feel as a powerful independent woman having 10 downing street to yourself as a sampler of your wonderful future
5268626 this acquisition will provide us with a new market entry into the california retail oriented recycled parts market and additional capacity to grow our southern california wholesale recycling business
5268627 i am also surprised by our uptake in australia and uk were lucky we happened to have a paypal payment path that could support those players because we werent anticipating early adoption over there
5268628 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5268629 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5268630 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaida in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5268631 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5268632 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and program for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5268633 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5268634 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant
5268635 they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5268636 we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan
5268637 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5268638 today we saw him reading out his own epitaph on his misrule and lack of governance
5268639 he tried to justify pretty much what he had done but i think at the end of the day this was the only option because the space for him to remain president had shrunk so much that it had become impossible to carry on
5268640 i wish i could fire shots to show my joy but unfortunately i cant do that
5268641 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now its a victory for the people
5268642 the country was doing better economically but now the politicians wont be able to preserve the economy and things will get worse
5268643 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
5268644 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
5268645 who else is conducting this kind of cowardly acts except for the taliban and al qaeda people
5268646 its nice to give stuff but that takes 20 minutes then bingo youre on vacation
5268647 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5268648 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5268649 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5268650 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5268651 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5268652 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5268653 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5268654 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5268655 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that
5268656 residents of two separatist areas of georgia now overrun with russian troops and abandoned by georgian soldiers

5268659 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
5268660 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there

5268665 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5268666 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer the evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children
5268667 it appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips
5268668 the crown would say that this collection of indecent photographs and the subsequent police investigation revealed that this defendant has been involved in the distribution of these photographs for the last four or five years
5268669 he was integral he played a key role he was trusted by others members of this site so much so that he stored horrific images of child abuse on their behalf he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5268670 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5268671 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5268672 there is a simple message for those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or indeed any

5268677 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
5268678 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
5268679 the public was never going to view this place it was just found out

5268682 the public was never going to view this place it was just found out
5268683 they got caught with this place they told our lawyers in negotiations that this place didnt even exist
5268684 whats going to happen here is police are going to detain people for an inordinate amount of time
5268685 theyre going to use this as an excuse to keep people out of the courts and off of the streets

5268692 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
5268693 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
5268694 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
5268695 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around

5268698 the scenario was this a terrorist with a backpack full of sodium cyanide a chemical used in gold mines
5268699 it was very exciting and it was as hard as i thought it was going to be
5268700 i had a four shot lead coming down the 18th and that made it a bit easier
5268701 it was a tough day it got windy after the greens got really firm i didnt hit it great just managed to get it in the hole
5268702 i knew the back nine was going to be tough
5268703 i knew that if i could shoot somewhere around par that was going to be close
5268704 my ball kind of dug in the bunker on 12 the third shot came out perfect and a little bit of luck at the end as the ball rolled into the cup
5268705 maybe i used up all my good shots on the front nine
5268706 i felt like i was hitting the shots i had to hit but i just wasnt getting it close enough to make the putts and put a little bit more pressure on brendon
5268707 its never nice to finish with three bogeys in the last six holes but thats golf its obviously very disappointing right now to finish the way i did and almost hand him the tournament but it doesnt matter its another week and its all good
5268708 anytime you can finish in the top 10 on this tour its a good thing
5268709 for me im just trying to put a bit more distance between myself and second on the money list
5268710 brendon is too good a player to be hanging around here the same as me

5268720 das war ein absolut verdienter sieg f r den vfb stuttgart wir haben vor allem in der ersten halbzeit lehrgeld gezahlt auch wenn wir selbst gute chancen hatten das 0 1 ist ungl cklich weil zu diesem zeitpunkt sascha r sler verletzt au erhalb behandelt wird da sind wir dann im mittelfeld nicht mehr organisiert beim 0 2 geben wir den ball an der grundlinie her das darf nicht passieren und auch beim 0 3 sind wir in der vorw rtsbewegung die beiden treffer haben uns gezeigt dass in dieser liga jeder kleine fehler bestraft wird

5268792 these are of one mind and they will give their power and authority to the beast these will make war with the lamb and the lamb will overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those who are with him are called chosen and faithful

5268896 when i was a boy the only role models i had were liberace and charles nelson reilly i couldnt play the piano and i wasnt much good at match game so i felt doomed now there are countless more images of gay people on television and i am grateful for every one of them but they dont represent that many more options the message i hear is that its ok to be gay as long as you are effortlessly stylish hysterically funny or both
5268897 while will and jack are as stereotypical as amos and andy they help humanize gay life
5268898 i know that a lot of people will watch this show who are not familiar with the gay community and they will start to reconsider their notions of identity their own and other peoples im really excited by that
5268899 several of the straight men have very intense experiences we anticipate that a lot of both gay and straight viewers will have their assumptions challenged about what it means to be gay and what it means to be straight
5268900 i hate to say that everyone is basically bisexual because ill get 4 billion letters from people on both ends but it is my belief yes that everyone has the potential but it is fueled or repressed by different things in your life i feel the capacity is there im proud of the ability i have to fall in love with both men and women
5268901 i met these two girls at a party and i was fascinated with the idea of whether it was easier to understand one another when youre both girls you can fall in love with anything its the sparkle in their eyes or it might be spiritual
5268902 ive met many crazy people on many crazy nights anything you can imagine ive done it its in my nature to just run wild and i do i love being naked and i love men and women i just seduce everybody sex is the best high its better than any drug i want to die making love because it feels so good for me a one night stand and a lifetime commitment are the same i love beautiful women too gender is not a problem for me when you fall in love with a man or a woman youre lucky
5268903 im reading a book about chinese medicine which claims that people are inherently bisexual to balance their energies and in a way that makes so much sense as humans we have both male and female energies i believe in kurt cobains statement that in the end everyone is gay everybody should have the freedom to experiment i believe sexual experimentation is part of human history
5268904 i have to say that i think theres a gay man in everybody i think every straight man has the capacity to have sex with another man i quite fancy the rock actually id love for him to throw me around a bit hes quite brutish and hot dont you think i should be careful about saying more he might find me and kick my ass if i meet a man i fancy enough to have sex with i will
5268905 now that im getting older the word gay doesnt make any sense to me anymore plus all the guys i sleep with tell me theyre straight anyway sexuality is such a modern thing if you go back to the roman times guys were sucking everything
5268906 a law branding one class of persons as criminal solely based on the states moral disapproval of that class and the conduct associated with that class runs contrary to the values of the constitution and the equal protection clause under any standard of review
5268907 private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution
5268908 separate is never equal civil unions are a step in the right direction but they almost always offer less than the full roster of rights that marriage entails and they still stigmatize same sex relationships as deserving only second class recognition
5268909 the majority of social conservatives oppose gay marriage they oppose gay citizens serving their country in the military they oppose gay citizens raising children they oppose protecting gay citizens from workplace discrimination they oppose including gays in hate crime legislation while including every other victimized group they oppose civil unions they oppose domestic partnerships they oppose well they oppose for the most part every single practical measure that brings gay citizens into the mainstream of american life
5268910 i think its entirely who you are from birth personally some people might choose but i think that its who you are i think people need to be able to be who they are i have a friend who was married for many years and then the marriage dissolved and he came out and he lived this life of tension and of great difficulty its in your system its in your genes i think that people have a right in america to be who they are who they are born as and we are all gods children
5268911 love is the most cherished feeling we have its unique to human beings and if anyone thinks they can dismiss love through politics theyre nuts
5268912 i imagine a world in which our genders had nothing to do with who we fall into bed with
5268913 in itself homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man either a human being without feeling fear restraint or obligation
5268914 beneath the duality of sex there is a oneness every male is potentially a female and every female potentially a male if a man wants to understand a woman he must discover the woman in himself and if a woman would understand a man she must dig in her own consciousness to dicover her own masculine traits
5268915 it is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple one must be a woman manly or a man womanly
5268916 i wish i could be so simple but ive been involved with so many different kinds of people a man for eight years a woman and then this transgendered person that i have to call myself omnisexual because i just dont believe in this whole lesbian boring ass fucking shit in new york amp l a
5268917 the way i approach the character isnt about being gay or straight its just about who you love gender has very little to do with it
5268918 for some reason when i was younger i dressed up like a girl i looked feminine and so straight boys wanted to fuck me and now i dont really look like that anymore im not a little girl im not skinny frail petite im a big guy although i still wear makeup so im in this weird land and its fucking strange im learning as i get older that sexuality is a very gray area i dont actually believe in gay and straight anymore the older i get the more i think its kind of a mind set when i was 16 i did not find women attractive as ive gotten older i can now look at womens bodies and think yeah theyre nice and i can watch porn videos with straight men and women and actually get turned on
5268919 my ultimate objective is to help create a society where people no longer define themselves as gay straight and bisexual when all three orientations are deemed equally valid and all intolerance is eradicated there will be no need to differentiate betweeen people of different sexualities true queer liberation is when nobody cares whos hetero homo or bi when we can love whoever we want man or woman without fear of ostracism prejudice discrimination or violence
5268920 i think the different kind of republican tag is a load of crap i wonder why gay republicans dont just go out in the parking lot and beat themselves up it would be quicker
5268921 in western culture the practice of assigning pink to an individual gender began in the 1920s
5268922 heterosexuality a weird concept of recent origin but terrible consequences is of course central to those very strange notions of human sexuality with which freud and his apostles saddled us for a century
5268923 freudians were never able to come up with a proper word instead of a hybrid greek latin one for heterosexuality because the greeks didnt know what it was they knew about reproduction they knew about lust and love they knew about the intensity of sexual desire between men and men women and women but for them lesbos was just an island off the coast of asia minor while sappho was your average pulitzer prize winning poet

5268927 how can we stop rape and woman battering by staffing rape crisis centers and refuges when there are thousands of movie houses millions of publications a multibillion dollar business that promote the idea that violence and the rape of women is sexually exciting to men and that we like it too
5268928 the title of this book take back the night refects this growing realization of the links among crimes against women the pollution of our media with sexist articles programming and advertisements and the increasing amounts of pornography readily available are hardly questioned rapes muggings and sexual harassment of women at all times but especially at night are the norm that we have been unable to walk the streets after dark without a male to protect us from all the rest of the men has been assumed in this society for so long that people can hardly imagine a culture in which this would not be the case

5268977 im not hungry right now ive got a lot of work to do
5268978 i dont know im worried about him he seems to have buried himself in his work since keils memorial service he didnt even eat today
5268979 i wouldnt worry too much i see this as sagers way of coping hes done this since he was little he would bury himself in his work for days and weeks at a time after something painful happened and so far hes come out all the better for it each time
5268980 dont worry hes not going to starve himself when hes ready hell come eat besides he could stand to loose a few pounds
5268981 but its the truth hes put on a few pounds lately but either way i think hes the least of our worries right now sager is a genius always has been geniuss dont do things quite like we do well just give him his space for now and let him work it out
5268982 can i have that book im looking for some information it may have
5268983 miguigua was a historical figure from the early old kingdom period he was known for his exceptional skills in sailing fishing and hunting he worked for most of his life striving to build bigger and better boats that could range father travel faster and move swifter in the wind than any other boats on the sea he is best known for his revolutionary ship designs that advanced nautical technology farther and faster than at any other time in history he was last seen in the forth rising of the twin full moons in the seventh year of chief naishia forth of the chiefs of the line of ibilith
5268984 that would be the year four hundred and thirty two in the old kingdom period just fifty years before the rise of gosad and the start of the new kingdom period
5268985 many ancient songs and stories were told about him well up into the early two hundreds of the third kingdom the song tells of his secretly building a ship that could sail to the end of the world and find what lay beyond it
5268986 interesting he had the same desire to sail to the end of the world as keil did i wonder if he ever succeeded
5268987 a cube of the sky that shown like the night it sailed on the air and made not a whisper of none can remember such a fearful sight save for one young boy miguigua the adventurer
5268988 a cube of the sky that shown like the night a black cube but it makes no sounds i dont know what kind of ship it could be but if its silent and it flies especially during miguiguas time then it cant be manmade
5268989 i am here on an errand of great urgency as you know my king i am a friend of the humans the race with which we share these islands
5268990 that is well known but i suspect that you are not here to flaunt your peculiar relationship with them
5268991 i ask your forgiveness on this my king but with your permission i would like to discuss this with you in private what i wish to speak to you about is of a sensitive nature i have been instructed to keep what i bring as a secret to all but you my king
5268992 captain take your men and my court members with you we wish to be alone
5268993 another race what have the humans taken in a new neighbor
5268994 its a bit more complicated than that you my king are no longer ruler of your domain
5268995 do not take that the wrong way my king let me explain first then you may choose how you will act
5268996 that is all i know but what i do know paints a frightful picture
5268997 indeed it does and it also gives understanding to your claim that i am no longer ruler of my domain
5268998 kimitchwach you have always been a loyal subject even when you went against my advice and joined the humans in kinship i have never said this to you before but your kinship with them has been a great blessing to us despite my initial reservations with such a relationship and while you bring me foul news of a great storm that has engulfed us unawares i do not hold it to your charge in fact i hold it to your credit that you would bring such knowledge to our attention so that we might save ourselves but saving us may be a difficult venture as you know i am an old bird and my days of flying have long since left me my body is more a prison now than a tool to be used of my choosing it is amazing how many enemies of our people i defeated in my youth and yet i was defeated by this the greatest of enemies time itself
5268999 i am afraid that i cannot help you anymore in freeing our people from our hidden oppressors
5269000 i am too old to lead such a battle for freedom but there is another who can carry on where i cannot
5269001 my eldest son prince loon is the one that can lead us through this it will be he who will save our people and maybe even your human friends as well as of today i will surrender my thrown and my nest to him so that he may succeed me as king
5269002 is it wise ive asked myself that question about many decisions before
5269003 yes i believe it is i had already talked to my son about taking over my thrown anyways as age has stripped me of all that a king should have so he is already prepared you will need a strong leader to carry you though this time of trouble my son is strong enough to lead us either to victory or to the aviaries of our ancestors believe in him trust him he will not fail you
5269004 then if it is your will that he serve in your place i will serve him with all my strength as i have served you
5269005 i know you will thank you for all you have done now go call my guards i have work for them to do
5269006 students were given a withering assessment by a misanthropic academic on 9 august

5269009 i had goosebumps i just laid it across my bed and stared at it for a while this is the ultimate in basketball
5269010 where does the patriotism come from inside of you historically what is it
5269011 well you know its just our country its we believe is the greatest country in the world
5269012 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that youre fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
5269013 no its a cool thing for me to say i feel great about it and im not ashamed to say it i mean this is a tremendous honor

5269031 a young adolescent male is anxious to learn how to treat a woman
5269032 what the men are doing in the world is continuing to see to see women as objects of their pleasure and their feeling of life it is quite enough behaviour in my opinion what the man is doing is watching pornography seeing fantasizing and he is doing this already in the world and he continues to view in the real without any difference in fact he sees nothing at all except what he represents to himself under his aesthetic gaze any woman known or unknown turns into the stranger that object of no interest except for its capacity to stimulate the subjects feeling of life the fundamental problem at the root of mens behavior in the world including sexual assault rape wife battering sexual harassment keeping women in the home and in unequal opportunities and conditions treating them as objects for conquest and protection the root problem behind the reality of mens relations with women is the way men see women is seeing
5269033 when one looks honestly at the contemporary porn industry one sees some disturbing images of where this world is heading
5269034 jensen cited adult producers growing fulfillment of the broad range of marketplace demands as one basis for his opinion discussing how adult companies need to continually produce
5269035 i asked one pornography producer about the rise of anal sex in the 80s
5269036 the producer replied that the majority of women do not seek out anal sex so when men get angry at their wives they secretly think to themselves that they would like to do that since they cant they like to watch it
5269037 the sexualizing of male domination and female subordination its a disturbing mirror for the culture in which we live
5269038 where is the industry going and what could possibly come after this
5269039 i have asked this to several pornographers some will say i hate to say it but the only place left to go is overt violence the other place to go is to continue to sexualize youth
5269040 open enrollment is the main reason i go to this school

5269043 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5269044 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5269045 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5269046 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5269047 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5269048 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5269049 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5269050 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5269051 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5269052 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5269053 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5269054 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5269055 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5269056 you need to go out or are you just irritated and you accidentally scraped your claws against the door
5269057 good god gracie what is wrong with you its perfect out there almost sylvan the morning sunlight filtering through the trees beaming through the humidity in the cool air and you need to come in ya just went out 2 minutes ago jeesh
5269058 because you get stupid when youre anxious and youre anxious a lot i dont mind letting you out and i dont mind letting you in just give me half an hour in between rather than 2 freaking minutes
5269059 i know you dont really want to go out i know what youre thinking youre thinking you havent had a you know what all night youre having trouble getting me to stop ignoring you so you want me on my feet then you lead me to the kitchen to where the chips are
5269060 i said you know im agnostic but if you can do something please do it
5269061 the question is how to get this growth so that it is not a problem
5269062 you have to ask is this a need or a demand
5269063 of course this is not just a discussion for spain it happens in california it happens in portugal in greece in italy what we are trying to introduce is a new message with the tradition that there is a message of cost a message of responsibility and a message of scarcity included in how we plan
5269064 its the height of hypocrisy for zaragoza to be having an expo that touts water sustainability
5269065 zaragoza is one of the biggest culprits in what ails spain too many farmers using too much irrigated land

5269077 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5269078 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5269079 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument

5269084 while the majority of the structures associated with carisbrook are relatively new as a sporting venue carisbrook and its associated mythology has outstanding significance in the public imagination and contributes to new zealands national identity
5269085 the street elevations of carisbrook show a piecemeal approach to the ongoing development of the facilities apart from the corporate suites building backing the terraces and fronting murrayfield street the treatment of the street frontages of the carisbrook stands are utilitarian and there is very little effort placed on aesthetic treatment apart from the colour schemes
5269086 this utilitarian approach is not representative of an international style to grandstand design but perhaps to local conditions
5269087 carisbrook has special historical significance in the history of new zealand sport it ranks as one of the most significant provincial venues
5269088 the biggest event in new zealands tennis history was held at lancaster park when australasia played america in the davis cup final
5269089 while the majority of the structures associated with carisbrook are relatively new the special significance of carisbrook lies with the years of sporting history and culture that have taken place on the pitch and in the memories of the thousands of sports fans who have passed through the turnstile building into the grounds

5269128 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5269129 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5269130 visit london will be focussing on how we can translate the excitement of the chinese people about their own olympic games into enthusiasm for londons games in 2012 our ambition is to capture the spirit that is bringing millions of chinese domestic visitors to beijing and make london the next obvious choice as a visitor destination we expect visits to london from china to grow by over 300 per cent by 2012 outpacing the growth rates in many of our traditional markets
5269131 continued open border policies along with violation of the rule of law will destroy all of america and all republics around the world how do we object to this takeover to whom do we cry out why isnt each states sheriff or attorney general calling forth the militia of the several states to close our borders deport all illegals stop the drug trade and coyotes bringing in more vermin to whom do we go to protect us my guess is keep your best friend ready oiled and loaded thanks
5269132 for what its worth our society is already so unsustainable that even if the population did not increase by one single person ever it will still crash it is so refreshing to hear common sense from a person who is thoroughly familiar with principles of ecology that i would jump for joy were it not for the fact that our society sure seems doomed as near as i can tell and based on the numbers given by the various ecologists which i have read something on the order of at least 80 of our current population is ecologically redundant the impression is also formed that what they refer to as overshoot occurred in about the year 1890 so this to me seems like an indication of how far out on an unsustainable limb we are having been living on borrowed or stolen resources for over 100 years now when the freight train collides with the stone wall its not gonna be pretty
5269133 you guys seem to get down primarily on mexicans and other latinos how come i never see you complaining about the various europeans that come here
5269134 i heard you on coast the other night and you were excellent
5269135 just to add my own two cents id like to say that i dont see much hope of stopping what is going on regarding the illegal alien situation
5269136 also one cant overlook the fact that europeans stole the land and therefore its tough to get onboard with any notion of problem solving that doesnt take into account guilt for past evil deeds as well as christian values that command us to view all of these millions of foreign born souls as being our brothers and sisters lest we be subjected to gods harsh judgment ourselves for being so cold and selfish
5269137 my own personal solution is to not have any kids and to remember that jesus said
5269138 i wish you well in your battle but within 10 years the wave of thought will likely go in the other direction with so called rap artists along with the offspring of millions of illegals will be leading the way in making it clear that

5269162 however by the time he davis returned to chicago and the renaissance he inevitably associated with people connected with the communist party since they were most likely to be involved in civil rights labor art and the fight for equality it seems that davis did join the party for a short time although on other occasions he denied it
5269163 davis met richard wright through his 1936 participation in the national negro congress which was alleged to be a communist front organization
5269164 davis did not see wright again after openly criticizing wrights attack of sic the communist party following the latters defection although both men held on to the hope of equality
5269165 davis joined the league of american writers a national united front organization for the communist party mobilized by the alarming rise of power of hitler and mussolini
5269166 if the relationship with davis was as blas as the associated press makes it sound why is obama mum about it and why did he try to hide davis identity in his first memoir published in 1995
5269167 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of privacy
5269168 but there was no need to protect davis privacy he had long been dead more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
5269169 a history of the radical communist and working class movement in hawaii
5269170 it is not well known im afraid that before statehood in 1959 probably the most vigorous communist and radical trade union movement under the u s flag was in hawaii

5269172 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5269173 there are children in that school as young as kindergarten age
5269174 in the gun free school zones act of 1990 congress made it a federal offense
5269175 in 1928 the communists initiated their drive toward world domination when they adopted the
5269176 throughout the 1990s womens magazine became focused less on fashion and more on features about violence against women and children even though crime statistics were plummeting across the country
5269177 in almost all of the stories the message was the same we have a big problem
5269178 all men are unfaithful rats abusive monsters dishonest scumbags or all of the above
5269179 to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them

5269200 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop

5269248 precious metals sentiment is still bearish as the us dollar continues to strengthen against the euro albeit in a volatile manner
5269249 the sharp dollar rally seen in the last month makes us more confident that the dollars slide against most major currencies which began in 2001 is over
5269250 although the path back to a stronger dollar in coming years wont be a smooth one
5269251 due to market volatility and higher demand in the entire industry we are anticipating delays in supply of all bullion products
5269252 once inventory is received there may be delays in processing and shipping by our vaults
5269253 weve seen a dramatic increase in the number of orders we called in our gold dealing team to work the assumption day holiday on friday all our branches saw prolonged waiting times for over the counter cash sales and this will surely continue over the coming week
5269254 fundamentally im not sure about the dollar in the long term

5269260 when i heard about i3 solutions i did not realize the opportunity to help individuals would be of this magnitude

5269262 a negative item may stay on your credit report for seven to ten years and sometimes even longer if the debt is sold over and over again and falsely reported

5269264 the fact that some studies show that more than 79 of credit reports have mistakes leaves me without words that would be like your bank losing your money over three quarters of the time

5269275 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5269276 we would like some transparency regarding who those citizens were what their issues were and how the chinese government has supposedly resolved those issues because we have justifiable concern about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals given that there have been several documented incidents in which chinese citizens who have legally applied have gone missing and are potentially in detention
5269277 i have lived all over since i became homeless including tunnels warehouses on the street and the houses of friends and relatives
5269278 what they have done to us is unlawful and unfair
5269279 i dont think they will give us any answers but despite this we still want to try to march within the law
5269280 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5269281 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5269282 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5269283 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5269284 decent numbers but a massive debt overhang is demanding better performance early next year 400 million comes due and if those payments cannot be made another 500 million will come due

5269289 what was your biggest moral failure what supreme court justice would you not have appointed and a straight up question about abortion
5269290 well i dont know if its concentration or apprehension i dont know what it is
5269291 i felt hibs were vulnerable i felt if we could get right at them we could have got an early goal it all was said in the dressing room
5269292 but there is a small thing as a coach i have been working very hard on the training ground and pitch maybe im giving them too much maybe they dont have the mental intelligence to take it in and then go and express themselves on the pitch
5269293 maybe i should just let them go and express themselves set it up and be hard to beat and let them go and play
5269294 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5269295 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5269296 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions villa only had a small squad last season and they finished above us in the table
5269297 we tried our best to get a system which suited thomas and it hasnt worked
5269298 it was the system to blame not the player or the club
5269299 celtic thomas gravesen and thomass representatives have agreed that he will part company with the club
5269300 im only going to bring quality in we havent got the money to go out and buy six 15m players
5269301 we dont have that so of course we are going to bring players in who are down at the lower end of the market but as ive always said im looking to get the main quality players in first then we will look at what we do after that
5269302 the only people who can give things a lift at the minute are the players who are here
5269303 the fans have been terrific and tried to stay behind the team we have just got to get on with things because nobody is going to feel sorry for us
5269304 blackburn they didnt feel sorry for us did they all we can do now is maximise everything that we have got here get the best from every single player
5269305 celtic got the breakthrough nakamura shunsuke does great for the goal hartley keeps his shot down and they go ahead
5269306 and then were sitting here thinking you do expect the response from dundee united because theyre pushing for the game and they have nothing to lose now they are trying to get a result
5269307 and you expect celtic to go on and win by two or three
5269308 five minutes after the goal big jan vennegoor of hesselink gets a great chance and really should have scored from 12 yards out he hits the target keeps it low but for me he really shouldve scored
5269309 sandaza looks a real threat he looks a good player and he made a difference today
5269310 we sat here watching the game and after 73 minutes we could sense that dundee united were going to get something because there was more purpose about their attack
5269311 when sandaza came on there was more belief and supply from conway craig and from grainger danny on the left hand side
5269312 i still think ive got to improve a little like my overall game but it was nice to get the two goals today
5269313 weve been practising a lot on finishing in training during the week and it was pretty similar to that game and i knew what i was doing and luckily enough it went in today
5269314 it was a very very hard game to play in and i was absolutely knackered towards the end and im sure everyone was
5269315 falkirk kept putting us under pressure and all credit to them but i think we deserved to win and i think we could have scored more goals
5269316 i thought alan obrien was absolutely brilliant today but to be fair he has been looking brilliant in pre season as well and i think the hibs fans will see the best of alan obrien this season now that hes got his confidence back that he maybe needed
5269317 im absolutely delighted with the quality of the additional staff we have appointed to the national management team
5269318 to secure the services of the ex all blacks captain mike brewer is a boost he is now a very experienced coach having worked in club rugby in ireland england and italy before becoming forwards coach for leinster

5269320 graham is among the most experienced defence coaches in the world having now spent five years in that position in rugby union with firstly munster and then ireland
5269321 im looking forward to working with frank and the other coaches
5269322 scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years
5269323 i have been an admirer of scotland and the work that alan tait has undertaken in the last few seasons
5269324 i look forward to being part of franks coaching team and to getting the players trust and buy in to the defensive systems ill look to put in place the experience ive gleaned from involvement in both union and league will hold me in good stead

5269344 although these were lower than in the light for a given hco3 concentration they still increased dramatically with hco3 addition showing that calcification in this coral is light stimulated but not light dependent

5269358 its a virulent cancer that is eating into our society

5269435 it all started when i got to shake hands with president george w bush when he was at a rally in daytona beach
5269436 when he bush finished he starting shaking hands with people in the front row i couldnt believe i was going to get a chance to shake his hand ive been working with the republican party ever since

5269440 awesome volunteer and i look for her to do great things
5269441 erika barger has been a real example as a teen volunteer for the republican party
5269442 she continues to be involved and we are very excited that she was able to go as an alternate delegate to the convention shell be able to participate in all activities except voting unless one of the main delegates drops out
5269443 i know when the big balloons drop i suppose ill anticipate the balloons dropping
5269444 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
5269445 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all

5269448 to just prove itself innocent pakistan is falsely blaming india it is clear that pakistan is behind all he terrorist activities in india
5269449 pakistan is a nation whose intelligence agency is not even under the control of its prime minister be it the regime of slain pakistans peoples party leader benazir bhutto or pakistan muslim league nawaz leader nawaz sharif pakistans intelligence agency isi has never been under their control

5269464 the project for excellence in journalism analyzed more than 5 000 economic stories in 2007 and the first half of 2008 the stories by 48 different news outlets were delivered by cable news channels network television radio newspapers and the internet
5269465 the study found that reliance on government data to track the economy is leading to scattershot coverage that at times lags months behind actual economic conditions
5269466 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later said project director tom rosenstiel
5269467 at times this has meant that reporters were writing about weakening economic trends at the very moment that conditions were starting to improve or vice versa

5269508 why didnt xyz happen in history or whats its cause
5269509 is problem such that certain percentage of lispers ask these questions or get confused by these
5269510 oh what a question i dont know really but high enough as it seems
5269511 well me if i were you i hadnt asked a question like this but did a meaningful test with the candidate
5269512 what did you think of that when that was playing out
5269513 well i think theres a fundamental difference because evangelicalism and mormonism
5269514 theres no doubt about it and theres some things that mormons hold to that are not historic christianity that all lutherans all methodists all baptists all pentecostals all catholics protestants hold true
5269515 for instance all christians believe in the trinity mormons deny the trinity so thats a fundamental difference
5269516 all christians believe in the old testament and the new testament mormons believe in additional books that historic orthodox christians reject there may have been a misunderstanding on that but i dont even think thats the whole issue i think that there are other issues involved in terms of who has had experience who has had leadership and who understands my problems
5269517 which probably does explain why they agreed to this thing with warren to begin with
5269518 it would be beyond imagination if i didnt get a prime speaking spot
5269519 i came in second i would think that ive earned the right to be there

5269522 i think governor romney must see himself as a symbol
5269523 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5269524 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5269525 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5269526 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5269527 it didnt have the bulk or the mass it seemed to be vacuous the hair did not look natural and the face bears a striking resemblance to an off the shelf costume
5269528 people who are not well informed on this subject matter then use this incident as a litmus test of the veracity of the entire subject
5269529 the amassed evidence of the footprints is strong evidence that there is a real animal that exhibits a consistent anatomy that is distinct from human anatomy and yet shows adaptations that are very elegantly suited to the habitat where they are reported to exist
5269530 i was hoping to convey to you that there is a body of data that is extremely compelling
5269531 we wanted to make sure the departments exposure to risk was minimized in every way possible
5269532 having the contractor responsible for the most critical phase of flight was one way to mitigate some of the risks
5269533 they dnd felt they would like the contractor to have responsibility for that
5269534 i found the idea on a website on farm diversification
5269535 i thought it would be good to be able to offer people who like local food something a bit different
5269536 snails have been farmed in britain for centuries and there is lots of archaeological evidence to back that up
5269537 in the monasteries the monks would have a fish pond beehives and a snail farm
5269538 and there are lots of placed in kent where there is evidence the romans farmed snails
5269539 they are quite endearing they dont bite or smell unpleasant or make a lot of noise and they are really quite friendly

5269701 following mahmood refats mort aux vaches cd here is another real middle eastern composer tarek atoui he was born in lebanon in 1980 moved to france in 1988 and studied at the conservatory of paris although his work is based in the field of the electro acoustics its all computer based using max msp much of his work is made for theatre there have not been many recordings available but surely this may change after releasing on the ever high profile label staalplaat much of this info i culled from the internet as staalplaat never gives much information so i was a bit surprised by what i heard many beats rolling over each other hardly in a way that would induce any form of dance music and from the rhythms more abstractions are made in the computer high pitched quickly moving some of these beats could pass on a extreme breakcore music hardcore gabber beats but in a non sequential way as to avoid any resemblance to dance music i n the pieces were the beats are down either in tempo or in presence atoui plays music that i think is much more interesting for instance in the final track he plays an interesting piece of music based on what could be middle eastern field recordings and remote electronics i think its the most interesting piece of the cd in other pieces such as the third the nerve and hectic is nice too one could argue that atoui plays some nice form of plunderphonics in a true original form

5269705 this new one comes with a sort of bathroom curtain plastic cover that is partly transparent but also makes a hallucinogenic thing the music is by andrey kiritchenko our man on the laptop and more from the ukraine around when this was recorded i also saw him play a concert and besides a laptop i believe he used an autoharp and a guitar the laptop contains the usual crackles hiss and processed field recordings but kiritchenko plays some rather nice warm ambient glitch music half way somewhere fennesz and microsound not yet really pop like and cut in to one long piece kiritchenko plays rather moody atmospheric music fortunately not too abstract with his ploinks on the guitars or his drones from the autoharp i remember back when attending the concert that kiritchenkos music is quite nice but perhaps better enjoyable at home then in a concert space with people standing around and talking like the one i saw now that it is o n cd i can only applaud the fact yes it works much better another great addition to the series
5269706 machinefabriek means machine factory you might expect a name like that for some einst rzende neubauten like industrial act but here thats not the case okay at some times machinefabrieks music might sound harsh and abrasive but industrial no my music is more about combining distorted raw sounds with subtle melodies and stillness references are tim hecker fennesz tarentel and stars of the lid despite the fact most other mort aux vaches releases are live documents this one is recorded at home before having it played by berry kamer from the vpro on dutch radio this time i decided to limit myself by using mainly the guitar and laptop and a record player on one track i roughly recorded some parts and chopped it up on the computer thats when the compositions came to life its a questioning of listening and the process itself will dictate the way to go i tried to make a pati ent record a record that slowly pulls you in ironically a big influence was the mort aux vaches cd by oren ambarchi for me thats the ultimate statement in guitar and electronics minimalism bathyale means the part of the sea between 200 and 1000 meters where no sunlight comes through i wanted to do something with water cause thats what i kept thinking of when making and listening to the music the pieces have a fluidity but at times they are pretty dark and crackly

5269709 mahmoud refat is from egypt who previously released on leerraum hes not a player of traditional instruments but is a normal artist with sound installations field recordings following a career in funk acid jazz experimental music i must say i had no expectations whatsoever i cant say im disappointed the whole notion that it should be ethnic inspired is of course bullshit it proves that whatever we call microsound for the lack of any better term is much more a global thing that we knew refat plays laptop music using sounds of whatever field nearby or far away but he adds low humming beats think ikeda or noto but on a much more subdued level which work well as a creepy undercurrent for the music the rhythmical notion he puts on makes this perhaps more clicks n cuts for the lack of any better term than plain microsound but the addition of field recordings is certainly a refreshing look on the subject matter meelkop meets noto chartier mee t pan sonic if you catch my fantasy running wild on the subject for me an entirely new artist but certainly someone to watch for the future

5269713 one amp 1 2 years ago meriel barham from leeds released her debut album kids with sticks as kuchen on karaoke kalk with kuchen meets mapstation now follows the second release by meriel former member of the british pale saints though this time as the title reveals its a joint project with stefan schneider from dusseldorf the person behind mapstation and also part of to rococo rot to those who are already familiar with the music of mapstation and kuchen the title will also give away something about what we are about to hear two people two musicians meet each of them bringing with them their very own idea of music and together trying to merge these into a unified whole rather by chance their paths crossed last year there was a liking for each other and for each others music ed martin from leeds had the idea that kuchen and mapstation should do a record together more a kind of remix album at the first step and finally the result is the album at hand which to ok two years to realize it in between this time sometimes they both did work together on the realization and sometimes for themselves until they finished it together in berlin this year its ten tracks reminds one of a long intense and also very personal dialogue a dialogue between two individuals who nevertheless harmonize in their ideas and who seem to like each other even when at variance kuchens sometimes more playful music connects seamlessly with mapstations perhaps more serial sound and yet each ones distinctive qualities remain in the foreground without challenging or levelling the others rarely has the attempt to bring together two different projects been so successful

5269716 hamburg germany henning wandhoffs second album follow up to sunny day chamberworks and band sessions data folk tunes meets tropicalia after the sunny day the curious night the mountaineer returns with a team of allies to tell you about his sleep the spooky drift between conscious and unconscious that digests the measures of the day the relics and puzzle pieces of a life and makes dreams from them the stories a mind tells to itself to make sense of what it is given this sleep is endoscopic it is the sleep that surrounds you looking at you creating a space for you to inhabit and so we listen in a room full of echoes homebound and enshrined in the house that this sleep has made for us the secret whispers of his voice sheltered in a harvest of guitar strings shielded by the breath that vibrates through a melodica hemmed by the brushes on a drum the hushed confidences told by a shaker by a few notes from a piano by a loop

5269721 theyre both r rated theyre both tropical if you call pineapples tropical which i do theyre both action movies and they both come packed to the gunnels with an arsenal of inappropriate belly laughs so who would win a pineapple express vs tropic thunder box office face off after considerable thought here i stand firmly in the fruit section pineapple express has a higher giggle per second ratio and the laughs lasted longer it wasnt quite so big budget gag heavy and it didnt have to work as hard for the laughter pay off moments of pure comedic genius from tom cruise and robert downey jr make tropic thunder a very worthy opponent but who knew stoner action movies could be so funny catch the pineapple express
5269722 tropic thunder was genius pineapple express was just an unfunny extended adlib session between friends
5269723 knockout of a comedy that keeps you laughing constantly its also killer smart lacing combustible action with explosive gags

5269750 i dont remember much but the girl in front of me crashing and then looking and seeing bikes everywhere i stood up and immediately started to cry i couldnt move my elbow
5269751 minutes before i was almost taken out in another crash and i was making my way back to the front
5269752 when something like this happens you have no control because it happens so fast i usually drive carefully to avoid this i had no choice

5269757 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5269758 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough
5269759 i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today
5269760 it strikes them down with absolutely no warning and these are particularly tragic because no one saw them coming
5269761 it haunts me every day to think i could have been able to do more had i been better educated

5269772 i wanted to put in everything that i found lacking in the other books dialogue characters discomfort
5269773 and theroux happened to be there at the start saying im opening up the door to this wanderlust in the american soul
5269774 i never saw myself as someone like faulkner who was writing about his home the people he knew at home his patch of landscape
5269775 i never really felt that writing about medford mass had a future
5269776 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
5269777 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it
5269778 the place had not evolved it had been crudely transformed less city planning than the urban equivalent of botched cosmetic surgery
5269779 likeliest solution to survival in an overcrowded world an almost robotic obedience decorum rigidity order with no frills
5269780 it didnt look like this it didnt smell like this it wasnt as crowded as this at night the roads were totally empty it was like the twilight zone going through the darkness
5269781 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
5269782 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad

5269785 the attention of the american side was drawn to the necessity of u s officials making public statements on the events in south ossetia in accordance with the realities of the complex circumstances in the region
5269786 the occupation must end your army must go home and our people must be allowed to return home too
5269787 georgia is always open to discuss any issues that may arise through dialogue and negotiations but our condition is that your army of occupation must leave and stop the devastation
5269788 have limited patrols in a prescribed area within the zone of conflict not to go into georgian urban areas
5269789 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
5269790 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
5269791 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
5269792 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
5269793 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge

5269800 he was riveted to it and intoxicated with the bloody pastime nor was he now the same man that he was when he had first come he saw shouted and was inflamed and he carried away with him the madness which would drive him to return and to draw others as well

5269802 this is a remote place and its already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
5269803 but we have only five loaves of bread and two fish
5269804 it isnt necessary to send the crowds away you feed them
5269805 i dont know what i feel it shows that nothing is impossible
5269806 america can only hope the proposed law is bingaman and rahalls clumsy attempt at political jujitsu the alternative is that the politicians in charge of committees that determine us energy policy are confused and ludicrously disconnected from reality
5269807 these young americans have responded to this difficult mission in afghanistan with tenacity selfless bravery and resourcefulness is typical of the united states military
5269808 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5269809 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5269810 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
5269811 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
5269812 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
5269813 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
5269814 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own

5269817 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
5269818 oh yeah you havent seen that its been on the internet for while
5269819 oh yah well i went to college with this guy
5269820 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
5269821 ich bin wirklich ein gro er fan von veranstaltungen bei denen es um adrenalin pur geht auch als zuschauer ist das ein richtiger kick

5269823 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5269824 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5269825 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5269826 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5269827 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5269828 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5269829 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5269830 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5269831 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5269832 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5269833 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5269834 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5269835 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5269836 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a
5269837 in other words he was given an option are you with us or are you not with us and he made a clear decision to be with us and hes acted on that advice

5269882 the most important part of it all for me was learning to say so what if shaun or danielle dont progress in a particular way it doesnt matter as long as they are happy
5269883 toby is a totally different boy now he was totally non verbal when we went to the us if you look at old photographs of him and ones taken later you can see it is like a light has been switched on now he is happier he is relaxed and he is enjoying being in contact with others and he is enjoying playing he is confident and relaxed in himself the school has been wonderful and are treating him as an individual and are going to be watching him carefully it is going to be a long process for him but he is doing incredibly well at the centre what we try and do is say there is hope there is lots that can be done and it is a treatable condition
5269884 hearing about how toby has done and how he has benefited from what happened to me is very touching the hendersons have been walking the path my parents did in the 70s i was totally mute i didnt make eye contact i didnt like to be touched in every way i was in my own world my parents were told focus on your two daughters your son will be put in an institution they defied the prognosis of the people around them and developed their own programme over three years and at the end of that time i emerged completely free from my autism
5269885 when i was spinning plates around my mum instead of taking them away she would spin plates with me people worry they will reinforce the behaviour but we have found when we do this children do these things less
5269886 we know there are a number of risk factors for autism and if we can pinpoint them we have better ways of identifying children at risk so we can get them into prevention or monitoring
5269887 this abnormal or accelerated rate of head circumference growth is a biological marker for autism
5269888 by itself head growth is not an indicator of autism
5269889 because kids are going to be getting bigger and development is so variable however if you notice it and some of these other symptoms it is a red flag to seek evaluation
5269890 some of the children in our study started with a very small head size and later their growth accelerated what we are looking for is disproportionate growth in children compared to the rest of their body in this study nearly 60 percent of the autistic children had accelerated growth but only six of the children met the criteria for macrocephaly
5269891 the doctor said kyle was going to be a vegetable but to me hes already a genius
5269892 id rather have a nice happy family rather than have the money to shop at macys
5269893 we were the first to say it was a neurological challenge
5269894 we were the first to use nutrition as a method of treatment
5269895 the kaufmans are usually very nice to people who have money
5269896 considering vaccines are the cornerstone of preventive care we thought it was imperative we say something about it
5269897 very often its difficult to let go of a theory
5269898 people get messages from tv or certainly with the emotional tone to it could cause people to become concerned
5269899 the characters products and events depicted in the episode are all fictional the storyline plays on topical issues for dramatic effect but its purpose is to entertain
5269900 so the suppositions used to argue that children might receive excessive doses of mercury by receiving thimerosal containing vaccines is refuted quite clearly by our study
5269901 parents really worry about their children and want to do the right thing and doctors want that too
5269902 he has been a strong supporter of more than 1 billion in federal funding for autism research on the root causes and treatments and he believes that we should increase funding for the individuals with disabilities education act to truly ensure that no child is left behind
5269903 when told by a person with autism attending his event that most private insurers will not cover people with autism giuliani said that he favored high risk pools for people with expensive conditions
5269904 miss burris let me try to explain this to you
5269905 the parents here at the kings daughters school center for autism well theyre very committed parents who prepared financially to have children miss burris theyre architects whose wives are physicians
5269906 some of our children are here for years a few months work does not necessarily make a difference
5269907 oh my gosh look what happened sally no i told you not to touch that its very dangerous honey look what sally did
5269908 we believe were the leading contender outside of the incumbent
5269909 the first thing that happened was we just had a bad pit stop that put us back there and we shouldnt have been back there to begin with
5269910 we finally had a great car its pretty disappointing that got us back there to begin with
5269911 we were three wide and i came off of turn 4 and my spotter at the last second said two cars outside and it was too late it looked like tony came off the wall and touched jimmie a little bit and jimmie came down and there was just no room to move there because we were all so tight coming off there
5269912 im relieved because weve been going every week going well we cant take to big of a risk but weve got to push hard enough
5269913 now we just dont worry about anything we can just drive as hard as we can do anything we possibly can and just go all out and thats all we can do and well see where we end up
5269914 weve been in a situation where weve kind of been just stuck in the middle
5269915 i dont want to be where we are in the points right now but in some ways this is an easier position to be in because now we just go out there and run hard every weekend and we can take chances and do things that can maybe get us that win
5269916 you cant risk fuel mileage you cant risk putting two tires on weve got to stay with four tires and we cant get too risky with our setups youre just trying to ride along there and not make mistakes now a mistake is made and im just glad we were running good finally
5269917 i had a problem when i pulled into the pits it happened real quick
5269918 i did all that i could do in the car to see if there was anything wrong with the switches all the gauges looked good we just had something break inside the engine
5269919 i havent had an issue with an evernham engine in three years that i can remember we do a great job we just had some type of an issue well find out what it was but it was pretty big
5269920 im upset because i thought we had a car to finish inside the top 10
5269921 i dont think that this hurt too bad were not going to be far from 12th but its going to be very attainable to get into the chase weve got three races to go and we can still definitely make the chase
5269922 were a bubble driver we just make stupid choices we cant keep our cars together we have dash malfunctions motors breaking at this point we dont even deserve to be in the chase
5269923 i would appeal to anybody who may have seen someone matching the description of the offender in the chapel brow area between 9 30pm and 10 30pm to contact police
